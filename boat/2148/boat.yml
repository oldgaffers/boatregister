full_description: |-
  Made by the company Padstow Sea Boats in 1992. The design is based on the
  Cornish pilchard fishing boats. It is made from GRP and requires minimum
  maintenance. She has wooden spars and teak and mahogany trim. It is the perfect
  boat for exploring estuaries and rivers with a family on board.


  She is stable with a weighty steel centreplate. She has a working boat rig,
  comprising of a jib and boom-less standing lug mainsail and mizzen. This is very
  flexible, and enables her to sail safely in a number of different wind
  conditions.
