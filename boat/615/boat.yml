short_description: Witch, a gaff-rigged cutter, is a yacht originally built as a ferry
  in 1898 for the Laird of Gigha on the western isles of Scotland.
full_description: "<p>Built by A M Dickie of Tarbert for William James Yorke Scarlett,\
  \ the Laird of Gigha, she was named &#39;Belem&#39; after the French three masted\
  \ barque which was famous for its speed. Used principally as a ferry to and from\
  \ the mainland, she was originally flush-decked with the skylight set in the deck.\
  \ Her design is quite advanced for the time with her three-quarter length keel and\
  \ cutaway stem. In 1918 she had the coachroof added which adds significantly to\
  \ the headroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, she took part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge,\

  sales_text: <p>Witch was built by Dickies of Tarbert&nbsp;as the private ferry yacht
    for the Laird of Gigha in 1898. Her full history is known and she has been well
    cared for over the years. Her structure is mostly original and she has recently
    had her below the waterline&nbsp;caulking raked and replaced with traditional
    cotton and red lead stopping. Below decks she was re-fitted in 1918 and then again
    in 1963. This latter was not comfortable and was replaced with a standard layout
    with galley and nav station in 2007.</p>
