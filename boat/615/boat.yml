  *Witch*, a gaff-rigged cutter, is a yacht originally built as a ferry in 1898
  for the Laird of Gigha on the western isles of Scotland.

full_description: |+
  Built by A M Dickie of Tarbert for William James Yorke Scarlett, the Laird of
  Gigha, she was named *Belem* after the French three masted barque which was
  famous for its speed. Used principally as a ferry to and from the mainland, she
  was originally flush-decked with the skylight set in the deck. Her design is
  quite advanced for the time with her three-quarter length keel and cutaway stem.
  In 1918 she had the coachroof added which adds significantly to the headroom.


  In 2013, she took part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge, visit [Sailing

    Once used only for local East Coast cruising she has been extensively brought up
    to a standard for longer cruises including Round Britain, North Sea crossings
    and Brest and Douarnenez. Her sailing characteristics have endeared her to
    successive owners and she points to wind like a 'witch'..

    Witch was built by Dickies of Tarbert as the private ferry yacht for the Laird
    of Gigha in 1898. Her full history is known and she has been well cared for over
    the years. Her structure is mostly original and she has recently had her below
    the waterline caulking raked and replaced with traditional cotton and red lead
    stopping. Below decks she was re-fitted in 1918 and then again in 1963. This
    latter was not comfortable and was replaced with a standard layout with galley
    and nav station in 2007.
