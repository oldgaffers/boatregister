full_description: |-
  *De Vliet* has had a varied life, and many changes in role. Her place and year
  ofÂ  build are uncertain, but she may be German, from around 1928. There are
  traces of a sealed up fish well in her plating, but she spent many years
  operating as a tug boat in the Netherlands. When the rounded tug stern was
  removed traces of an older flat stern were revealed.


  In 2003 the plan was to rebuild her with what may be her original lines and rig,
  as a gaff cutter.
