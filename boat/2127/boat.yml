short_description: <p>Annie is a Cornish Crabber Yawl built in 1990</p>
full_description: Annie's first owner kept her on the Suffolk Coast. He converted
  her to a cutter Sept 1996. When he sold her in 1998 she moved to the Solent. In
  2000 she was sold again, moved to Fowey and re-named Annie of Fowey. In late 2009
  she was sold and moved to the River Towey  where she battled the elements until
  purchased by present owners in 2016. They are undertaking a lengthy programme of
  works to restore her to her original condition. In 2017 it is planned she will be
  in Mylor.
