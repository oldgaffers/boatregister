  participant at the East Coast OGA events.
full_description: |-
  The name 'Plum' was given by the original owners and, as it is thought to be
  unlucky to re-name a boat, has never changed. Other than the obvious fruit
  connection, the word Plum means 'good'!


  Plum is a gaff-cutter, Heard 23, built by Martin Heard at the Gaffers and
  Luggers boatyard at Mylor in Cornwall in 1990. The design is based on the
  Falmouth Working Boat, which evolved for fishing and shellfish dredging in the
  mid 1800s. There is a bye-law in the Fal Estuary, in Cornwall, which forbids
  oysters to be fished for by boats under mechanical power and even today Falmouth
  Working Boats from the Gaffers and Luggers boatyard can be seen dredging for
  shellfish under sail. This is the world’s last Oyster dredging fleet to work
  under sail alone and at it’s peak in 1924/25, there were 50 boats working the
  Fal fishery.


  Plum has a glass-reinforced-plastic (GRP) hull with a wood deck and
  superstructure and wood (Columbian pine) spars.
