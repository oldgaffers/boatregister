full_description: "<p>The name &#39;Plum&#39; was given by the original owners and,\
  \ as it is thought to be unlucky to re-name a boat, has never changed. Other than\
  \ the obvious fruit connection, the word Plum means &#39;good&#39;!</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Plum is a gaff-cutter, Heard 23, built by Martin Heard at the Gaffers and Luggers\
  \ boatyard at Mylor in Cornwall in 1990. The design is based on the Falmouth Working\
  \ Boat, which evolved for fishing and shellfish dredging in the mid 1800s. There\
  \ is a bye-law in the Fal Estuary, in Cornwall, which forbids oysters to be fished\
  \ for by boats under mechanical power and even today Falmouth Working Boats from\
  \ the Gaffers and Luggers boatyard can be seen dredging for shellfish under sail.\
  \ This is the world&rsquo;s last Oyster dredging fleet to work under sail alone\
  \ and at it&rsquo;s peak in 1924/25, there were 50 boats working the Fal fishery.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Plum has a glass-reinforced-plastic (GRP) hull with a wood deck and superstructure\
  \ and wood (Columbian pine) spars.</p>"
