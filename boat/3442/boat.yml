short_description: 19' half decked boat designed by Francois Vivier. Home built.
full_description: |-
  19' design for home builders by Francois Vivier. Designed with raids in mind it
  has 230 sq ft (21.3 square metres) of sail area and is quite flat bottomed
  compared to Francois' other designs as well as having a 125kg cast iron
  centreboard. Best rowed by two people.


  The third boat that I have built, it took me a little over two years to
  complete.


  Mine is sail number 4, others have been built in France, Australia and the USA
  and UK. Half decked and cabin versions.


  Mine lives on the trailer most of the time, I can launch and retrieve single
  handed in most conditions.


  Assymetrical spinaker on a short bowsprit is an option.
