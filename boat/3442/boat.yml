full_description: "<p>19&#39; design for home building by Francois Vivier. Designed\
  \ with raids in mind it has 230 sq ft&nbsp;(21.3 square metres) of sail area and\
  \ is quite flat bottomed compared to Francois&#39; other designs as well as having\
  \ a beefy 125kg cast iron centreboard. We have rowed it&nbsp;but is certainly happier\
  \ at the sail end of the sail and oar conundrum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third boat\
  \ that I have built, it took me a little over two years to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Mine is sail number 4, the others have been built in France as far as I know,\
  \ There is also&nbsp;one under construction in Australia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mine lives\
  \ on the trailer most of the time, I can launch and retrieve single handed in most\
  \ conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an option for symetrical or asymmetrical spinnakers\
  \ included in the plans. I have had an asymmetric spinnaker made and intend to get\
  \ it rigged up over the winter for a first go summer 2020.</p>"
