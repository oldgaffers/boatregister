  **The history of Chance from her launch to the present day**

  **History**

  Chance was launched at the James Silver boatyard at Rosneath to a John Bain
  Design Chance was a change in direction for John Bain and James Silver's
  boatyard as Chance was a true 50/50 motor Sailer and not as many of the boats
  which came before Chance and after Chance were motorboats.

  Chances' design was to be called a Western Isles after the nearby area where the
  boatyard is situated.

  Chance was commissioned and launched in 1948 for her first owner Lovat Crosley
  at Greenock.

  1951 through to 1955, Name changed to Token by Capt. (S) S. J. Read, Southampton

  1956 – 1970. The Hercules Engineering Co. Ltd, Southampton

  1970 – 1980. Edward W. and E.D. Boxall, Southampton

  1980. Onwards the Lloyd's register was closed to new entries, at which time it
  is not known who her owners were and how long they owned her until the present
  day.

  Chance has had the same engines throughout the years from 1948 until 2021 when
  the engines have been removed to have new engines fitted towards the end of her
  restoration. They were listed as "2 oil engines, 4 cyl, 90 x 120mm, and Dorman
  diesels.

  Chance had several owners after it original owner and spent most of her days in
  and around the Solent. Until later in her life which was spent a short time on
  the River Thames, then for a short while at Membury, then back to the River
  Thames at Egham where she had some planking replaced, then Chance moved to
  Wadebridge in Cornwall. Then she moved once more to Woodplumpton in Lancashire
  where she is presently stored in a Storage yard.

  The plan at the moment is to do as much work as possible to get her in a
  condition to move her down to my yard in Essex so that I can continue the work
  near to my home.

  **Technology**

  Chances' construction was common for the time period in which chance was built.
  Grown oak stem made in section to go from the stem head to the front of the
  keelson and keel and apron and through bolted, grown oak frames and steamed oak
  ribs, Oak keelson and oak keel, grown oak floors which the iron keel is bolted
  through. Oak engine beds which run for 20 feet along the hull to which the two
  engines are bolted to.

  Chance has two beam shelfs, one that runs from the transom to the galley area of
  the hull, and then the second beam shelf runs from the forward end of the
  cockpit to the stem. Chance has grown oak deck beams with lodging knees where
  the tabernacles for the both mast positions.

  The deck is made of teak and is single skinned and screwed to the deck with
  bronze screws to the deck beams. The deck skylights are fitted to the deck beams
  and they have their own carlins which the deck skylights are screwed through
  from below up into the skylights.

  The hull is planked in Mahogany and is fixed to the ribs with copper nails and
  roves and bronze screwed to the grown frames.

  The construction of the boat was a common method for the period although the
  design of the boat was a change in direction for both James Silver and John Bain
  as they had not built a true motor Sailer before.

  The engines that fitted to Chance was a common engine fitted to boats at that
  time, the only change was they were being used as auxiliary engines and not her
  main form of propulsion.

  Chance is a rare example, as Chance was only one of two built to the western
  isles design and I have not been able to find the other western isles built to
  this boat design through my research.

  Chances’ provenance is through the Lloyds register of shipping and the fact
  chance still has the official number on her forward deck beam.

  **Social Values**

  I am Chances’ latest owner and the owner who is going to get her back into
  commission after a long restoration project which will take between 3 to 5 years
  to complete.

  Chance, as symbolic valve in as much as she was a change in direction for the
  boat builder (James Silver) and designer (John Bain), to build a true 50/50
  Motor Sailer.

  There is a class association for James Silver boats on Facebook and to which I
  am a member.

  **Aesthetic Valves**

  Chance as a well-proportioned shape to her and the design is pleasing to the eye
  and the design makes for an easily driven hull

  **Rarity**

  As for the rarity of Chance there are no other Western Isles in existence, as it
  has been impossible to track down the other Western Isles that was possibly
  built by James Silvers’ boatyard, if in fact the other Western Isles was ever
  built.

  **Integrity**

  At the moment the majority of the hull planking is original to when Chance was
  built apart from the some of the areas of the hull that have had replacement
  planking fitted to the hull over the years. However, the interior of the boat
  has been modified over the years and in places destroying the original fabric of
  the original interior, however, when much of the more recent modification were
  removed it was possible to see the original design of the interior and it is
  planned to reinstate the original design of the interior back as part of her
  restoration.
