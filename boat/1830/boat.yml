full_description: |-
  *Ostrea Rose* was built in 1980 to a design by the first owner, evolved from the
  bawley design of his Great- Great-Grandfather Josiah Pitt who moved from Leigh
  to Maldon in the 1870s.


  She worked comercially on the River Blackwater for 3 years, catching oysters for
  the "Maldon Oyster Fishery". After this she was sold and converted to a yacht,
  worked for a while as a charter boat, taking up to 5 guests in an interior
  fitted "in the Edwardian style".
