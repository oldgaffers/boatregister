  In 1899 the decision was made to adopt a new class of boat for Hoylake Sailing
  Club.  The lug rigged, 16 foot clinker boats were developed from a design by
  Captain Winchester, a club member, and built by Alex Latta, also a club member
  and owner of a busy boat building yard.  ‘Opera’ class racing commenced at
  Hoylake in June 1902.
