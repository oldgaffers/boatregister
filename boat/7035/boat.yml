short_description: <p>A Yachting World 5 Tonner, &#39;Jo&euml;lle&#39; was built in
  1947&nbsp;at Philips Yard, Dartmouth.</p>
full_description: "<p>Originally built for a French dentist, &#39;Jo&euml;lle&#39;\
  \ has been in the same family for 54 years (1963 - 2017). Writing in 2017, her owner\
  \ writes about his father and his own period of ownership:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\
  \n<p>Father carried out routine maintenace at Topsham for ten years, before I took\
  \ over at Cowes and Poole. Father sailed the West Country, the Channel Isles and\
  \ N. Brittany with his sons. He and I had one of the best sails I can remember,\
  \ from the Dart to the Folly Inn on the Isle of Wight, where I took over maintenance\
  \ with my wife and children. Father still sailed with us occasionally, to Chichester,\
  \ Beaulieu and Poole. He also sailed with my brother and my Boss at BHC, to France.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Later in 1972, I joined the RNLI, and &#39;Jo&euml;lle&#39; moved with\
  \ us to Poole. Amongst other things we were able to drop the keel and replace keel\
  \ bolts, totally re-deck with Trakmark and re-engine the Vedette with a Perkins\
  \ Diesel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a family we sailed to Alderney, Guernsey and the South\
  \ Coast. On the passage home we heard Concorde&rsquo;s double &lsquo;Bang&rsquo;.\
  \ One of the best family passages ever.</p>\r\n</blockquote>"
