full_description: "Puffin is a 27' gaff cutter. She has a clinker construction with\
  \ a near plumb stem and a long keel. She was built in 1894 by the apprentices of\
  \ Adams Yard, Gourock. She's been based on the Clyde ever since; \_as a victualling\
  \ boat for the Clyde islands, seeing service as a mail boat for the war ships in\
  \ WWII, and as a CND peace boat in the 80s. She was built as a schooner but was\
  \ converted to a gaff cutter rig in the 1920s. Around ten years ago she was abandoned,\
  \ confiscated by the yard, and was destined for the bonfire. Puffin was rescued\
  \ at the eleventh hour by my father and I. Sadly, my dad passed away suddenly shortly\
  \ after we took on Puffin, but I've continued the (fairly major restoration) myself.\
  \ I hope to get Puffin back on the water in the next year or two, and look forward\
  \ to sailing the waters of the Scottish islands with my family and friends for many\
  \ years to come!"
