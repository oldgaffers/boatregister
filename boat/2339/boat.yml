full_description: |-
  Nightingale was launched in 1996 by an East Coast Bargemaster and was in service until July 2000. She was subsequently sold and equipped by her new owners for offshore cruising.Nightingale replicates the heavy displacement cruising yachts designed by
  William Atkin in 1925 to meet the demand in the USA created by Ralph Stock's
  book 'The Cruise of the Dream Ship' describing how, in 1918, Ralph Stock bought
  a Swedish built Colin Archer pilot boat, built at the turn of the century. He
  sailed with his sister and a friend to the Pacific Islands via the Panama Canal,
  in order to recuperate from the horrors of the First World War.

    33”, 4 berth Gaff Cutter.For the last 20 years *Nightingale* has visited most of
    the Traditional Boat Festivals throughout northern Europe. This magnificent sea
    boat has looked after her present owners for over 20 years, providing a
    fulfilling and enjoyable retirement. Unfortunately, it is now time to ask
    someone else to plan her summer cruising programme and look after her.
    Professionally-built in 1980, Nightingale’s mono-coque, ferro-cement hull and
    decks have been uniquely sheathed and encapsulated in epoxy resin in order to
    provide the driest and most comfortable traditionally rigged boat imaginable.
    The four large berths, plus a pilot berth, enable four adults to make distance
    passages in comfort. Fitted with a 25 hp, 3 cylinder Vetus/Mitsubishi engine and
    250 litre fuel tank for long-distance cruising. All electronic equipment is in
    full working order, including the fully-integrated trim-tab steering system with
    numerous spares. Comprehensive sail wardrobe for both cruising and racing, plus
    many extras including life raft, rigid and inflatable dinghy if required.  Lying
    Cowes, Isle of Wight.  Ron Hanson: 07780 616747 | hansonr.rh@gmail.com
