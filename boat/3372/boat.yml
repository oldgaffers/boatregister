full_description: "<p>In 1949 this West Briton design won the shoal draft cruiser\
  \ design competition, but &#39;Ostara&#39; is thought to be the only hull that was\
  \ built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Ostara&#39; attended the Queen Elizabeth ll Spithead\
  \ review in 1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her centreplate case was rebuilt in teak, 1963,\
  \ and 20 lengths of mahogany planking were replaced with larch in 1982. She had\
  \ a major refit with her wooden mast replaced with Sailspar aluminium and the&nbsp;\
  \ cockpit/galley/chart table were rebuilt in 1983. New heads were fitted in 1990.&nbsp;</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 2017, six mid-starboard frames were repaired.</p>"
