  'Ostara' is a West Briton design built in 1950. She was called 'Framar II' from
  1951 to 1953.
full_description: |-
  In 1949 this West Briton design won the shoal draft cruiser design competition,
  but 'Ostara' is thought to be the only hull that was built.


  'Ostara' attended the Queen Elizabeth II Spithead review in 1953.


  Her centreplate case was rebuilt in teak, 1963, and 20 lengths of mahogany
  planking were replaced with larch in 1982. She had a major refit with her wooden
  mast replaced with Sailspar aluminium and the  cockpit/galley/chart table were
  rebuilt in 1983. New heads were fitted in 1990. 


  In 2017, six mid-starboard frames were repaired.
