  "When his last boat, the 42' Tredwin barge *Pearl*, was burnt out on moorings,
  Mr. Denys Rayner decided to try his hand at designing a boat, after studying the
  "How To" articles in the Y.M. Economy limited the size to less than 23''
  overall, while a plea from the Shipmate was more or less an order for 6ft
  headroom."

  The preceding extract from the February 1937 issue of Yachting Monthly was
  penned by Maurice Griffith.

  *Robinetta* was designed from the outset for single handing, with all lines
  except the jib halyard let to the cockpit. She was strongly built with pine
  planking on an oak and elm frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead
  ballast. Her main cabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems
  from the extension of the hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on
  to say, "Perhaps the most striking feature of this experimental design is the
  fullness of the hull, the pronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships
  aft, and the enormous quarters, which appear to be based on those of the French
  crabbers."


  *Robinetta* is mostly original, but her iron keel was replaced by lead in the
  1950 or 60s when small changes were also made to her foredeck, both to the
  designs of Alan Buchanan.

  Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine
  with a Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural repairs were
  performed during the winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings and
  doubling several ribs.

  In 2012, she was re-caulked by Paul Drake of Tollesbury and given a new sail
  plan by Mark Butler of James Lawrence. This necessitated a new gaff, made by
  owner using a birdsmouth construction and the one fitted is the prototype, which
  by 2022 had done 10 seasons.

  Previous sail dimensions: Mainsail Head: 9.17 ft Topsail Perpendicular: 6ft
  Topsail luff 13 ft.

  Deck beam replaced and other repairs winter 2017/18. New Yanmar 1GM10 2022.
