short_description: '<p><em>Robinetta</em> is a 22'' 6" tabloid cruiser, designed by
  Denys

  Rayner and built for him by the Enterprise Small Craft Company, Rock Ferry, Birkenhead.</p>'
full_description: '"When his last boat, the 42'' Tredwin barge _Pearl_, was burnt
  out on moorings, Mr. Denys Rayner decided to try his hand at designing a boat, after
  studying the "How To" articles in the Y.M. Economy limited the size to less than
  23'' overall, while a plea from the Shipmate was more or less an order for 6ft headroom."


  The preceding extract from the February 1937 issue of Yachting Monthly was penned
  by Maurice Griffith.


  _Robinetta_ was designed from the outset for single handing, with all lines except
  the jib halyard let to the cockpit. She was strongly built with pine planking on
  an oak and elm frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead ballast. Her main
  cabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems from the extension of
  the hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on to say, "Perhaps the
  most striking feature of this experimental design is the fullness of the hull, the
  pronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships aft, and the enormous quarters,
  which appear to be based on those of the French crabbers."


  Robinetta is mostly original, but her iron keel was replaced by lead in the 1950
  or 60s when small changes were also made to her foredeck, both to the designs of
  Alan Buchanan.


  Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine with
  a Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural repairs were performed
  during the winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings and doubling several
  ribs.


  In 2012, she was re-caulked by Paul Drake of Tollesbury and given a new sail plan
  by Mark Butler of James Lawrence. This necessitated a new gaff, made by owner using
  a birdsmouth construction and the one fitted is the prototype, which by 2022 had
  done 10 seasons.
