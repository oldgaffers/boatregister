short_description: <i>Robinetta</i> is a 22' 6" tabloid cruiser, designed by Denys
  Rayner and built for him by the Enterprise Small Craft Company, Rock Ferry, Birkenhead.
full_description: "<p>\"When his last boat, the 42' Tredwin barge <em>Pearl</em>,\
  \ was burnt out on moorings, Mr. Denys Rayner decided to try his hand at designing\
  \ a boat, after studying the \"How To\" articles in the Y.M. Economy limited the\
  \ size to less than 23<del>'</del>' overall, while a plea from the Shipmate was\
  \ more or less an order for 6ft headroom.<del>\"</del>\"</p>\n<p>The preceding extract\
  \ from the February 1937 issue of Yachting Monthly was penned by Maurice Griffith.</p>\n\
  <p><em>Robinetta </em>was designed from the outset for single handing, with all\
  \ lines except the jib halyard let to the cockpit. She is strongly built with pine\
  \ planking on an oak frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead ballast. Her\
  \ main cabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems from the extension\
  \ of the hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on to say, \"Perhaps\
  \ the most striking feature of this experimental design is the fullness of the hull,\
  \ the pronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships aft, and the enormous\
  \ quarters, which appear to be based on those of the French crabbers.\"</p>\n<p>Robinetta\
  \ is mostly original, but her iron keel was replaced by lead in the 1950 or 60s\
  \ when small changes were also made to her foredeck, both to the designs of Alan\
  \ Buchanan.</p>\n<p>Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the\
  \ previous engine by the current Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural\
  \ repairs were performed during the winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings\
  \ and doubling several ribs.</p>\n<p>She was re-caulked with new gaff and sails\
  \ in 2012.<br>\n <br>\n Previous sail dimensions: Mainsail Head: 9.17 ft Topsail\
  \ Perpendicular: 6ft Topsail luff 13 ft</p>\n<p>Deck beam replaced and other repairs\
  \ winter 2017/18.</p>\n<p>Read articles about Robinetta from the Royal Cruising\
