short_description: |

  for WD Silcock and his wife to gently sail on the Norfolk Broads and around the
  Suffolk Coast. She was designed by Harold Lidston who lived in Cowes.
full_description: |
  Built 1910 by Frederick Miller of Oulton Broad and originally
  named *Nautilus* to a design by HH Lidstone to a fairly high price for
  an owner and his wife to cruise the Broads as well as coastal cruising.

  She was kept in immaculate condition by the owner for 20 years until he was
  no longer able to use her in 1931. She was then bought by Maurice Griffiths who
  wrote about her in &#39;Ten Small Yachts&#39; (whilst aboard her) and &#39;Magic
  of the Swatchways&#39;
  
  She changed hands twice prior to the war,
  belonging to a Dr. Gordon Grenville and a Major Shackell who used her until the
  end of the war. She was then purchased by a yard and refitted internally as a
  speculation and sold to a Mr May.
  
  She was purchased in 1961 by a Mr. AF Braithwaite and a syndicate from
  Hertfordshire and had some &pound;500
  spent on her in a major refit. Mr. Morrison bought her in 1970 and cruised in
  Holland on the Ijsslemeer and around the Dutch Friesian Islands. She also went
  on the OGA Heineken Rally in 1974.
  
  Mr. &amp; Mrs. Saville bought her in 1976, only a matter of weeks before the East Coast Race.
  
  Martyn and Bryony Mackrill have owned *Nightfall* since March 1984.
