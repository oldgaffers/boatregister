full_description: "<p>Built 1910 by Frederick Miller of Oulton Broad and originally\
  \ named &#39;Nautilus&#39; to a design by HH Lidstone to a fairly high price for\
  \ an owner and his wife to cruise the Broads as well as coastal cruising.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>She was kept in immaculate condition by the owner for 20 years until he was\
  \ no longer able to use her in 1931. She was then bought by Maurice Griffiths who\
  \ wrote about her in &#39;Ten Small Yachts&#39; (whilst aboard her) and &#39;Magic\
  \ of the Swatchways&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She changed hands twice prior to the war,\
  \ belonging to a Dr. Gordon Grenville and a Major Shackell who used her until the\
  \ end of the war. She was then purchased by a yard and refitted internally as a\
  \ speculation and sold to a Mr May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was purchased in 1961 by a\
  \ Mr. AF Braithwaite and a syndicate from Hertfordshire and had some &pound;500\
  \ spent on her in a major refit. Mr. Morrison bought her in 1970 and cruised in\
  \ Holland on the Ijsslemeer and around the Dutch Friesian Islands. She also went\
  \ on the OGA Heineken Rally in 1974.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Saville bought\
  \ her in 1976, only a matter of weeks before the East Coast Race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martyn\
  \ and Bryony Mackrill have owned &#39;Nightfall&#39; since March 1984.</p>\r\n\r\
