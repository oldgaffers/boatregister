full_description: "<h4>Louise Heyworth wrote to the Gaffers Log Editor, December 2007</h4>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>I believe my father, William Humphries, is a member of your Association.\
  \ Unfortunately due to a deterioration in his health he is now in residential care\
  \ and rather sadly I find myself writing to you with a plea for finding a home for\
  \ his beloved &lsquo;Dorothea&rsquo;, a 36 foot Gaff Cutter built by W E Thomas\
  \ circa 1915.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently moored in Suffolk &lsquo;Dorothea&rsquo; sank\
  \ following the recent freak tidal surge. My plea is simple, do you know of anyone\
  \ who is interested in the salvage of her. Apart from having spent many happy family\
  \ adventures on board her it seems a tragic waste to see her broken up, as is proposed\
  \ if a new owner cannot be found. Please reply to me urgently as she will not last\
  \ the winter on the slipway and will be scheduled for breaking up sooner rather\
  \ than later.</p>"
