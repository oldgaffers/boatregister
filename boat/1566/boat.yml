full_description: "<p>&#39;Laura&#39; was built in 1900 for Joseph Henry Atkey, of\
  \ Pascall Atkey &amp; Son, arguably the oldest Yacht Chandlery in the UK at Cowes,\
  \ IoW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally an open boat she was decked over in 1910. In her\
  \ early days she was used to transport chandlery for the business across to Cowes\
  \ from the mainland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was purchased by the Seabroke family during\
  \ the Second World War, and remained in their custodianship until the death of Richard\
  \ in 2017. She is reputed to be very fast, but has been laid up ashore since 2008.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>For years she was lovingly sailed, carefully maintained and kept on a swinging\
  \ mooring in Newtown, and taken ashore in 2008 yfor a refit. Time overtook her owner,\
  \ who was unable to complete the work. She had been properly cradled, carefully\
  \ covered and kept dry and well-ventilated. She is still very original and lacks\
  \ modern electronic conveniences, but she has never been mucked about.&nbsp; Her\
  \ inventory is very original and includes a beautifully-made Pascal Atkey copper\
  \ kettle, almost certainly one of the few left in existence.</p>"
