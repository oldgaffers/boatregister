  *Diric* takes her name from her first owners Richard and Diane, who lived in
  Yarmouth IoW. She is built of the best materials (carvel round bilge mahogany on
  oak, lead keel, canvas covered decks).

  After World War II *Diric* was sold to Col. Mitchell, who lived near Yarmouth,
  and taught Sea Scouts to sail. She was sold in the 1970s to John Sleight and
  then transferred to his brother Colin in the 1990s.

  In 1998 she was bought by Steve Pavey who changed her name to *Diane* and
  replaced her Stuart Turner with a Britt engine

  Bought by Nick and Jill Bredon in 2008, who undertook an extensive refit/rebuild
  at the Classic Boat Museum, Newport IoW. In 2010, she was winner of the YOGAFF
  Concourse d'Elegance.

  In 2015 her new owner returned her to her original name of *Diric*, and had Nick
  Gates of Emsworth give her an extensive refit.This included renewing all the
  varnished brightwork on the cabin and the coamings around the large cockpit.

  *Diric* has a comfortable and cosy 2 berth cabin with fitted heads.
