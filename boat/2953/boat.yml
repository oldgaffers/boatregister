full_description: |-
  *Diric* takes her name from her first owners Richard and Diane, who lived in
  Yarmouth IoW. Built of the best materials (carvel round bilge mahogany on oak,
  lead keel, canvas covered decks).
  After World War II *Diric* was sold to Col. Mitchell, who lived near Yarmouth,
  and taught Sea Scouts to sail. She was sold in the 1970s to John Sleight and
  then transferred to his brother Colin in the 1990s.
  In 1998 she was bought by Steve Pavey who changed her name to *Diane* and
  replaced her Stuart Turner with a Britt engine

  Bought by Nick and Jill Bredon in 2008, who undertook an extensive refit/rebuild
  at the Classic Boat Museaum, Newport IoW. In 2010, she was winner of the YOGAFF
  Concourse d'Elegance. Her current owner returned her to her original name, and
  just had Nick Gates, Emsworth, give *Diric*, an extensive refit costing some 
  £24,000, including all the varnished brightwork on the cabin and coamings 
  around the large cockpit.

  *Diric* has a comfortable and cosy 2 berth cabin with fitted head. She has no
  electronics currently but there are places for echo, vhf and an electronic log.
  Yanmar GM10 engine. Very capable, fully equipped and ready to sail, *Diric* has
  been kept ashore in the winter months and has her own craddle/props. Well cared
  for in family ownership.
