full_description: "<p>Built in 1938 by Elkins of Christchurch and bought by a couple\
  \ from Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) called Diane and Richard; hence her original name\
  \ of &#39;Diric&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II &#39;Diric&#39; was sold\
  \ to Col. Mitchell, who lived near Yarmouth, and taught Sea Scouts to sail. She\
  \ was sold in the 1970s to John Sleight and then transferred to his brother Colin\
  \ in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998 she was bought by Steve Pavey who changed\
  \ her name to &#39;Diane&#39; and replaced her Stuart Turner with a Britt engine.\
  \ She was bought by Nick and Jill Bredon in 2008, who undertook an extensive refit/rebuild\
  \ at the Classic Boat Museum, Newport IoW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, &#39;Diane&#39;\
  \ was winner of the YOGAFF Concourse d&#39;Elegance. In 2015, her new owner, Edmund\
  \ Hewitt changed her name back to her original one &#39;Diric&#39;.</p>"
