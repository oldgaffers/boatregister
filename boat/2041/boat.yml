short_description: <p>&#39;Dart&#39; is a Mersey Rivers Class yacht, designed by Crossfields
  of Arnside and built in 1912.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Dart&#39; was launched in 1912. She was one of ten Rivers
  Class Yachts built by William Crossfields and Sons for the River Mersey Yacht Club,
  and a sister yacht to &#39;Severn&#39;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was the first Rivers
  Class yacht to be sold out of the Royal Mersey Yacht Club, who had commissioned
  the &#39;Rivers Class&#39; from Crossfields at Arnside. In 1920 she was bought by
  W &amp; E Wilson of West Kirkby on the River Dee side of the Wirral, remaining in
  their ownership into the 1950s when she was redecked and fitted with a coachroof,
  then re-rigged as a Bermudan sloop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is reported to have
  had only three owners by February 1986 when she was purchased by Jack Miller who
  bought her to refit and re-rig her as a gaff cutter, removing the coachroof and
  reinstating the original deck layout.&nbsp;She then passed to Jack&#39;s son, Nick,
  based in Barrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1912 Owned by H.V.Stowell.
