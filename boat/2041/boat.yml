full_description: "<p>&#39;Dart&#39; was launched in 1912. She was one of ten Rivers\
  \ Class Yachts built by William Crossfields and Sons for the River Mersey Yacht\
  \ Club, and a sister yacht to &#39;Severn&#39;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was the\
  \ first Rivers Class yacht to be sold out of the Royal Mersey Yacht Club, who had\
  \ commissioned the &#39;Rivers Class&#39; from Crossfields at Arnside. In 1920 she\
  \ was bought by W &amp; E Wilson of West Kirkby on the River Dee side of the Wirral,\
  \ remaining in their ownership into the 1950s when she was redecked and fitted with\
  \ a coachroof, then re-rigged as a Bermudan sloop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is reported\
  \ to have had only three owners by February 1986 when she was purchased by Jack\
  \ Miller who bought her to refit and re-rig her as a gaff cutter, removing the coachroof\
  \ and reinstating the original deck layout.&nbsp;She then passed to Jack&#39;s son,\
  \ Nick, based in Barrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1912 Owned by H.V.Stowell.\
  \ Came last in Rivers Class series.<br />\r\n1913 Sold R.M.Fernie, possibly connected\
  \ with Fernie Brothers Shipping Line. Again came last.<br />\r\n1914 Sailed by W.Miles\
  \ Forwood. Won a race and came fourth in Rivers Class series. Miles Forwood was\
  \ a future High Sheriff of Westmorland and member of Royal Windermere Yacht Club.\
  \ His father was Sir William Forwood, a leading Liverpool ship owner.<br />\r\n\
  1921 Sold to W &amp; E Wilson of West Kirkby Sailing Club on the River Dee side\
  \ of the Wirral.&nbsp;<br />\r\n1939 Recorded as taking part in a race at West Kirkby\
  \ Yacht Club.<br />\r\n1950s Refitted with cabin. Gaff rig replaced with more modern\
  \ Bermudian Rig.<br />\r\n1970s? Brought to Barrow-in-Furness, owned by Mr Arthur\
  \ Johnson, and sometimes in partnership with a co-owner.<br />\r\n1990 Bought by\
  \ Jack Miller, father of Nick Miller, author of &#39;Lancashire Nobby&#39;. &#39;Dart&#39;\
  \ returned to a gaff cutter rig. The original sloop rig with a short bowsprit was\
  \ known to be hard mouthed so was not reinstated.<br />\r\n2006 Inherited by Nick\
  \ Miller. &#39;Dart&#39; was in need of refastening, some broken frames replaced&nbsp;and\
  \ the cabin was at the end of its useful life.<br />\r\n2016 Sold and undergoing\
  \ further restoration.</p>"
