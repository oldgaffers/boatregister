  *Early Dawn* left England in the early 1980s and sailed to Portugal, Spain, Morocco, the Canaries, and Madeira, before heading back into the Mediterranean. This took a couple of years as they were not in a hurry. After many adventures and a shipwreck in Ibiza the crew left the boat when the skipper decided to go down the Suez Canal.
  Information about what happened to her later is needed.
