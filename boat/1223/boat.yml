short_description: Barge Yacht designed by Frank Shuttlewood
full_description: |-
  The 35ft barge yacht *Tiny Mite* was built and designed by Frank, son of JW
  Shuttlewood, in 1956. She was one of the only smaller barge yachts to be
  spritsail-rigged. She was built for the Whittingham family of Rochford but by
  the 1960s/70s she was owned by the McDowell family of East End Paglesham who
  cruised her for many years on the East Coast.


  *Tiny mite* was recently (2023) sold for £1 to a member of Leigh motor boat
  club. She had been lying in their compound for many years & is by all accounts
  in need of a considerable amount of work.
