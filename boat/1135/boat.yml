full_description: <i>Larry</i> was commissioned as a "fast cruiser with some racing
  potential" and launched in 1907. WH Watkins, a founder member of the Royal Ocean
  Racing Club (RORC), raced her in the English Channel and North Sea from 1935 gaining
  firsts each year until 1938 when she came 2nd.<p>Larry continued racing after the
  Second World War, initially as Flagship of the Royal Artillery Yacht Club. In 1951/52
  she was a Bermudan cutter.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1953 preparations began for long distance
  cruising and the first of three&nbsp;doghouses was added, with the gaff rig restored.
  Electrolysis thwarted an Australian voyage and the lead keel was sold.</p><p>Harold
  Kimber&#39;s yard at Burnham-on-Sea took on an initial restoration, fitted an iron
  keel, and sailed &lsquo;Larry&rsquo; as a family boat. Between&nbsp;1963 and 1969
  Frank Leigh completed the&nbsp;restoration in Burnham-on-Crouch with&nbsp;the high
  level of convenience and comfort that remains today. She was relocated to the Mediterranean.</p><p>Dick
  Couture bought &lsquo;Larry&rsquo; in 1975 and lived aboard&nbsp;until 1991, based
  in Antibes, Ibiza, Gibralter, the Caribbean, Guernsey and Portugal. He sold her
  in 1984, buying her back two years later, she had been neglected in the Mediterranean
  for most of that time. In 1995, Couture launched &#39;Young Larry&#39;, a steel-hulled
  boat to his own design and based on Larry&#39;s design. <a href="/boat/young-larry">also
  in the OGA Boat Register</a>.</p><p>Sue and Christopher Singer took &lsquo;Larry&rsquo;
  on in 1991, based initially in Hythe then Dover before racing&nbsp;from Southampton
  to New York direct in 2000. The race took 53 days with no use of the engine. She
  then went to Maine and&nbsp;Nova Scotia returning to the UK in 2003 via Newfoundland,
  Labrador and Greenland with three years in Inverness to sail the Western Isles,
  Orkney and Shetland thence to Lime House Basin and her 100th birthday celebrations
  in 2007.</p><p>&lsquo;Larry&rsquo; spent the winter of 2010 in Harstad near Tromso
  in the Norwegian Arctic followed by two years in&nbsp;Shetland. In 2014/15, she
  overwintered in Vilagarcia, Western Spain.
