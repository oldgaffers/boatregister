  sales_text: <p>Felicis is Mitchell Sea Ranger no 110 built in mahogany. She comes
    complete with two sets of sails. Trailer not included.</p><p>At the moment she
    has been out of the water for a few years and kept in a garage so is completely
    dried out. Many of the roves have come loose and so the whole boat really needs
    re-fastening. There are also some planks with splits on the lands and so some
    repairs will be needed. Ideally she should go to someone who wants a project to
    bring her back to life as I do not have the time do it myself.</p><p>I will deliver
    to a reasonable distance (&lt;=&nbsp;100 miles from Cambridge).</p>
