  *Codling* is an unstayed catboat with a bowsprit. Her design
  is after the racing catboats of the 1840s.
full_description: |+
  *Codling*, built as a Freedom 21 in 1987, is derived from
  the catboats originally built to fish the shallow waters off Cape Cod from about
  1840. The cat rig has a single unstayed mast stepped well forward, and is sailed
  upwind with mainsail only. In 1853 one of the early racing boats with the cat rig
  was shipped to Cowes from the USA, and raced very successfully. Her name was *Una*
  and she gave her name to this rig in English waters - the Una-rig.
  
  A retractable bowsprit was fitted in 2009 to enable downwind sails to be carried
   - an asymmetric spinnaker or a roller-furling code zero.

  In the OGA 55 race on 18 August 2018 she finished Class 3 under 23' waterline - first on elapsed
  time, and first on corrected time.
  
  Overall - fifth boat on the water, and second overall on corrected time.
  
  For 2019 the gaff and topmast, previously made from aluminium alloy have been replaced
  by new spars of carbon fibre.
  
  Solent Gaffers race 2019, Cowes to Lymington - second
  on the water to Rosenn, but first overall on corrected time.
