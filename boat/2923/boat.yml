  upwind with mainsail only. In 1853 one of the early racing boats with the cat rig
  was shipped to Cowes from the USA, and raced very successfully. Her name was <em>Una</em>
  and she gave her name to this rig in English waters - the Una-rig<p>A retractable
  bowsprit was fitted in 2009 to enable downwind sails to be carried - an asymmetric
  spinnaker or a roller-furling code zero.<p>In the OGA 55 race on 18 August 2018

  2019 the gaff and topmast, previously made from aluminium alloy have been replaced
  by new spars of carbon fibre.<p>Solent Gaffers race 2019, Cowes to Lymington - second
  on the water to Rosenn, but first overall on corrected time.
