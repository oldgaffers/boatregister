full_description: |-
  'Dusmarie', originally called 'Daisy', was built in 1884 as an oyster smack by
  Aldous of Brightlingsea. She worked under sail, fishing no. CK12, until 1932
  when she was sold, converted to a yacht, and renamed. Under her owner, Commander
  Douglas Herbert Dixon, she was sailed to the Baltic and remained there for the
  duration of the Second World War.


  Rescued in 1945, she was re-built and converted to a yawl in 1947. She was also
  fitted with an engine, in 1952 a Stuart Turner 8hp and a single cylinder Saab
  10hp in 1972.


  She took part in several Tall Ships Races in the 1970s, often with an all female
  crew, skippered by Astrid Llewellyn (Douglas Dixon's daughter).

    "Dusmarie" is an oyster smack, built in Brightlingsea 1884 by Aldous & Sons. She
    was originally called "Daisy". Bought by Douglas and Mary Dixon from Zebedee
    Milgate in 1932, she was converted to a sailing cruiser, 1933, and re-named
    "Dusmarie". She is much travelled (Baltic, North Sea, Mediterranean and many
    Tall Ships races) skippered by Astrid Dixon, often with an all-female crew. She
    remained in the Dixon family until 1994, and was sold to the current owner in
    2001.

    She is on the National Register of Historic Vessels and in 2006 was judged
    number 23 of the 250 British Classics selected by Classic Boat Magazine.

    The current owner, reluctantly and because of advancing years and grandchildren,
    is seeking the next steward to sail and enjoy this unique piece of East Coast
    maritime history.
