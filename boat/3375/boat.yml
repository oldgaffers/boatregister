full_description: "<p>SYBELLA, was built in 1951 in the Royal Dock, Grimsby, the whole\
  \ history of her and one of the builders has been researched. The two builders were\
  \ Tom Barkham and Dick Abernathie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom was the nephew of Alexander\
  \ Gostelow, from Boston, Lincs, who was a well known Smack and yacht builder, Tom\
  \ started working in the Boston yard in 1924, and worked on almost all of the Smack\
  \ yachts, PRIVATEER,ELEANOR, RADIANCE, STORMALONG, WHITE FOAM, SALLY BROWN, ROLLING\
  \ HOME , just to name afew, just before the start of the second world war, the Gostelow\
  \ yard closed.TOM was sent to Grimsby to work on the minesweepers for the firm HUMPHERY\
  \ AND SMITH. IT was here he met with Dick Abernathie, and after the war they started\
  \ working together, doing repairs on small boats and yachts. Tom was asked by a\
  \ old customer from his Gostelow days to build a small yacht.The designer was S\
  \ W Belchambers, and the owner was Bert Bellamy. In 1952 Tom and Dick went there\
  \ separate ways, and Tom finnished his career working on the restoration of H M\
  \ S VICTORY, TOM died in 1980, 6 years after retiring,&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have\
  \ origanal photos of SYBELLA being built, and on the day of her launching, In 2001\
  \ i privatley published a book Gaff Rigged out of Boston, which covers all the boats\
  \ built by Gostelow and details about what TOM did and photos of SYBELLA. IT was\
  \ during my research that i found the owner of SYBELLA&nbsp;and pestered him for\
  \ many years to sell which he did &nbsp;to me in 2008, sadley by this time she needed\
  \ quite abit of work, but in her day(see black and white photo) she looked stunning,\
  \ also this was TOM,s favourite boat he ever built and also his last, from day one\
  \ i was helped and encouraged by Toms brother and his cousin to try and find all\
  \ the boats which where built in the Boston yard, i was pleased to be able to do\
  \ that as when the book was published Bill and Phillip soon &nbsp;died.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>I would love someone to take this project on, and see her return to grimsby\
  \ under sail, thanks for reading this S R WRIGHT</p>"
