short_description: <p>&#39;Elizabeth Mary&#39; was built at Looe, Cornwall by Pearce
  in 1908, allegadly as a Plymouth hooker. Her owner in 1977, Trevor Vincett, suggests
  she was more likely a Polperro gaffer.</p>
full_description: "<p>Her 1977 owner stated that she most certainly was a Polperro\
  \ boat and fished out of that port by the same family until Col. Phibbs bought her\
  \ in 1931. A 7hp Kelvin engine was fitted, in the fo&#39;csl, whilst fishing, but\
  \ removed by Mike Johnson. Elizabeth Mary&#39;s rig was that of Polperro gaffer\
  \ with a loose-footed boomless mainsail which was altered for dredging after the\
  \ second world war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her Plymouth fishing registration, PH107 came\
  \ about because a previous owner, Col. Phibbs had registered her as a British vessel\
  \ in that port and when a subsequent owner tried to re-register her as a fishing\
  \ vessel, the port could only be changed at expense. Her original fishing number\
  \ is believed to be FY28. The following article was written by her owner in 1977.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>&rsquo;Elizabeth Mary&rsquo; was built at Looe by Pearce in 1908,\
  \ allegedly as a Plymouth Hooker, but I haven&#39;t seen any other Hooker that looked\
  \ at all like her and I suspect she was really built as a Polperro Gaffer, examples\
  \ of which can be seen in Edgar March&rsquo;s &#39;Inshore Craft&#39; book. She\
  \ would have been used us a long liner, fishing between the Start and the Lizard\
  \ mostly. Nothing is really known of her until she was bought by a Marines Capt.\
  \ William O&rsquo;Hara Phibbs in 1931. He converted her to a yacht complete with\
  \ cabin and eventually a small engine.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She next\
  \ changed hands in 1962 when she was bought by Mrs. Doreen Johnson of Penryn near\
  \ Falmouth. She was transferred to her son Michael in 1970. He did a terrific amount\
  \ of work on her which included taking the cabin off again and opening her up ready\
  \ for use dredging oysters in the Fal estuary. She was re-decked, had new mast partners,\
  \ beam shelves, frames where necessary, re-planked in part, new spars and rigging\
  \ and a new rudder. With the help of a White Fish grant he also put in a Saab diesel\
  \ engine. Mike Johnson worked her under sail for 2 or 3 seasons, and he took part\
  \ in the local Gaffers races, unfortunately without too much success, apart that\
  \ is from the Fowey passage races which he won on more than one occasion.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Although dredging is only allowed under sail between 9am and 3pm,\
  \ it is permitted to motor to the grounds before or after dredging. The thin end\
  \ of the wedge for working sailing craft in Britain perhaps. Eventually however,\
  \ Mike removed this engine which was how I bought her in partnership with Mike Birch,\
  \ who has recently won the Jester Class trophy and first multihull trophy in the\
  \ 1976 Single Handed Transatlantic Race. One day he will turn up at one of our Gaffers\
  \ races with a gaff rigged Trimaran!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She has only\
  \ been used for pleasure, with the odd charter thrown in, since we&#39;ve had her\
  \ here in Dartmouth, and of course we&#39;ve taken part in the local races when\
  \ possible. Our first success was in a passage race during a regatta when with Mike&rsquo;s\
  \ wife Jo helming, we sailed from Torquay to Dartmouth and finished second in front\
  \ of 16 modern Bermudian craft. On corrected time we won by 15 minutes and so our\
  \ rating was amended accordingly to leave us with a two minute victory. In 1976\
  \ we repeated the performance and won by eleven minutes after having led all the\
  \ way to the last mark, some 200 yards from home, at which point a Bowman 46 managed\
  \ to pass us - just.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Mike Birch&#39;s delivery work\
  \ and involvement in Round Britain and single handed racing didn&#39;t give him\
  \ much time to use &lsquo;Elizabeth Mary&rsquo; and so he sold me his shore early\
  \ in 1976. We have taken part in the three South Western Old Gaffers Races with\
  \ fair success, winning Class 2 in 1976, and taking the SW Commodore&#39;s Pennant\
  \ as first SW boat. We made a hair raising passage up to Cowes in 1975, to finish\
  \ second in the class, and to collect the Edgar J. March Memorial Trophy for the\
  \ first work boat to finish. During the gale following that race, &lsquo;Elizabeth\
  \ Mary&rsquo; was damaged and her gaff broken.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>By\
  \ the time repairs were effected and the weather looked anything like decent, it\
  \ was November and we were not altogether happy about the prospect of a Channel\
  \ passage under sail in an open boat in what was really winter. It turned out to\
  \ be better than we had feared, and apart from a bumpy ride off Anvil, we made the\
  \ passage to Dartmouth in about 16 hours, including a few zig-zags through the Russian\
  \ fishing fleet resident in Lyme Bay at that time of year.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\
