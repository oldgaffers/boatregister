full_description: "<p>&#39;Madeline&#39; sailed with the East Coast OGA during the\
  \ 1970s and 1980s, but hasn&#39;t been seen for a number of years. In mid-December\
  \ 2018 the Boat Register Editor was asked for informaiton about a boat in St Malo\
  \ which seemed to have been imported into France around 2003. Supposedly a Morecambe\
  \ Bay Prawner, built in 1896, her new French owner was hoping to get her classified\
  \ by the French government. After tireless research, it&#39;s now confirmed that\
  \ &#39;Madeline&#39; is not a &#39;Nobby&#39;, but was built by James of Brightlingsea\
  \ in 1898. Members may find the full story in the March 2019 issue of Gaffers Log.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>There are several &#39;For Sale&#39; notices in the Gaffers Log newsletter\
  \ and some interesting race reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1969/2: For Sale notice</h3>\r\

  \n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Letter to the Editor in Gaffers Log 1979/1 From Pat Walton\
  \ of Woodbridge</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I am afraid that I know very little\
  \ of Madeleine&rsquo;s past. I bought her from Mike Brooks (Bodger) who is an OGA\
  \ member in July 1979 at Fred Webb&rsquo;s yard, Pin Mill. He had bought her with\
  \ the intention of taking her to Holland to sell and was not really interested her\
  \ history. He did however tell me that he bought her from a man who was moving to\
  \ the USA and I think his name was Smith, I was also told that she was owned by\
  \ a group of young men which would tend to tie in with Madeleine No. 84.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>The measurements I gave you on the application form are correct as she has\
  \ been very carefully measured for the East Coast race, and I have enclosed a photo\
  \ which you may keep. Her condition at present is that although her hull is in fair\
  \ condition her deck and coachroof is in very poor condition and is at present being\
  \ repaired by myself, which will include new decks, cabin trunking and several deck\
  \ beams, trying to keep everything as original as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will\
  \ in the next few days contact King&rsquo;s yard and see if they have any information\
  \ and would be very much obliged if you could furnish me with the addresses of any\
  \ of the past owners of Madeleine you may have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only other information\
  \ I have is that in 1970 her hull was rebuilt by Fred Webb&rsquo;s yard, I spoke\
  \ to Fred about it and he told me in his opinion the cost of which came to more\
  \ than the boat was worth and that the then owner died shortly after it was completed\
  \ and so never gained the benefit of the work.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Extract\
  \ from Race Report for the Thorn Trophy, Stour Rally, August 1987</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\
  \n<p>Shoal Waters, Robinetta and Madeleine were first round Pye End, finding the\
  \ lightest of sea breezes to give them steerage way. Madelein, setting a huge jack-yard\
  \ topsail and balloon jib, rapidly overhauled Robinetta. By Parkeston she was closing\
  \ the gap with Shoal Waters, but suddenly the wind went to westerly, then north-westerly,\
  \ catching her unawares. Thus, Shoal Waters, that intrepid ditch crawler, sailed\
  \ to victory to take the Thorn Trophy. Madeleine took the Coxswain Working Boat\
  \ Trophy, whilst Robinetta took second.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Extract\
  \ from Maldon Anniversary Rally Report, September 1988</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\
  \n<p>Despite the vagaries of wind, tide and boat speed, craft closed up on each\
  \ other as Colne Bar was turned. Noorderzon, going well in such light conditions,\
  \ was with Madeline and Janty. Considering Madeline had lost the top of her mast\
  \ at the Stone race, she was going incredibly well too, the &lsquo;stumpy&rsquo;\
  \ rig suiting her. . . . As nightfall came, the gaffers crossed the line, 13 out\
  \ of the original 23 having stuck it out for nearly 10 hours. But it had ben one\
  \ of those very rare (for 1988) days when the sun shone from sunrise to sunset,\
  \ more enjoyment than hardship for once! Madeline took seventh place.</p>\r\n</blockquote>"
