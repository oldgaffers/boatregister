short_description: Built c.1896, there are some gaps in what we know about 'Madeline'
  . . .
full_description: "'Madeline' sailed with the East Coast OGA during the 1970s and\
  \ 1980s, but hasn't\nbeen seen for a number of years. In mid-December 2018 the Boat\
  \ Register Editor\nwas asked for informaiton about a boat in St Malo which seemed\
  \ to have been\nimported into France around 2003. Supposedly a Morecambe Bay Prawner,\
  \ built in\n1896, her new French owner was hoping to get her classified by the French\n\
  government. After tireless research, it's now confirmed that 'Madeline' is not a\n\
  'Nobby', but was built by James of Brightlingsea in 1898. Members may find the\n\
  full story in the March 2019 issue of Gaffers Log.\n\nThe register was contacted\
  \ again, in 2023, by the French owner, who sent several\npictures of her restoration\
  \ and relaunch.  \"*Our restoration work is now\ncomplete, after all these years\
  \ of hard work.*   *MADELINE is back in salt water\nand we're very proud of her!*\
  \   *She sails beautifully and her nautical\nqualities surprise us with each new\
  \ sail*.\"\n\nThere are several 'For Sale' notices in the Gaffers Log newsletter\
  \ and some\ninteresting race reports.\n\n### 1969/2: For Sale notice\n\n\n> 7 Ton\

  ### Letter to the Editor in Gaffers Log 1979/1 From Pat Walton of Woodbridge\n\n\
  \n> I am afraid that I know very little of Madeleine’s past. I bought her from Mike\n\
  > Brooks (Bodger) who is an OGA member in July 1979 at Fred Webb’s yard, Pin Mill.\n\
  > He had bought her with the intention of taking her to Holland to sell and was\n\
  > not really interested her history. He did however tell me that he bought her\n\
  > from a man who was moving to the USA and I think his name was Smith, I was also\n\
  > told that she was owned by a group of young men which would tend to tie in with\n\
  > Madeleine No. 84.\n> \n> The measurements I gave you on the application form are\
  \ correct as she has been\n> very carefully measured for the East Coast race, and\
  \ I have enclosed a photo\n> which you may keep. Her condition at present is that\
  \ although her hull is in\n> fair condition her deck and coachroof is in very poor\
  \ condition and is at\n> present being repaired by myself, which will include new\
  \ decks, cabin trunking\n> and several deck beams, trying to keep everything as\
  \ original as possible.\n> \n> I will in the next few days contact King’s yard and\
  \ see if they have any\n> information and would be very much obliged if you could\
  \ furnish me with the\n> addresses of any of the past owners of Madeleine you may\
  \ have.\n> \n> The only other information I have is that in 1970 her hull was rebuilt\
  \ by Fred\n> Webb’s yard, I spoke to Fred about it and he told me in his opinion\
  \ the cost of\n> which came to more than the boat was worth and that the then owner\
  \ died shortly\n> after it was completed and so never gained the benefit of the\
  \ work.\n> \n> \n\n### Extract from Race Report for the Thorn Trophy, Stour Rally,\
  \ August 1987\n\n\n> Shoal Waters, Robinetta and Madeleine were first round Pye\
  \ End, finding the\n> lightest of sea breezes to give them steerage way. Madelein,\
  \ setting a huge\n> jack-yard topsail and balloon jib, rapidly overhauled Robinetta.\
  \ By Parkeston\n> she was closing the gap with Shoal Waters, but suddenly the wind\
  \ went to\n> westerly, then north-westerly, catching her unawares. Thus, Shoal Waters,\
  \ that\n> intrepid ditch crawler, sailed to victory to take the Thorn Trophy. Madeleine\n\
  > took the Coxswain Working Boat Trophy, whilst Robinetta took second.\n> \n> \n\
  \n### Extract from Maldon Anniversary Rally Report, September 1988\n\n\n> Despite\
  \ the vagaries of wind, tide and boat speed, craft closed up on each other\n> as\
  \ Colne Bar was turned. Noorderzon, going well in such light conditions, was\n>\
  \ with Madeline and Janty. Considering Madeline had lost the top of her mast at\n\
  > the Stone race, she was going incredibly well too, the ‘stumpy’ rig suiting her.\n\
  > . . . As nightfall came, the gaffers crossed the line, 13 out of the original\
  \ 23\n> having stuck it out for nearly 10 hours. But it had been one of those very\
  \ rare\n> (for 1988) days when the sun shone from sunrise to sunset, more enjoyment\
  \ than\n> hardship for once! Madeline took seventh place.\n> \n>"
