short_description: |-
  Katie is one of only two Baltic One Design GRP gaff cutters taken off the hull
  of gentleman's cutter 'Fortuna'.
full_description: |-
  *Fortuna*, a gaff cutter, was found off Cockham Slip upstream of Hoo on the
  Medway. She was owned by Dr Clark and her blue Registration Book showed she had
  been built in 1880 as a steam launch. Subsequently she had been converted to a
  yacht. It was decided to give her a third reincarnation and make a plug from her
  to build a new class of yachts to race on the Thames.


  Harry Hutchinson found *Katie* as an abandoned project on the Thames and took
  her to Lymington. Subsequently she moved to the East Coast with new owners, in
  2010, and sailed regularly in OGA events. She was sold in 2016 and again in 2024


  Her sister ship, *Chickpea*, has been fitted out for cruising with a cabin.
