short_description: <p>Katie is one of only two Baltic One Design GRP gaff cutters
  taken off the hull of gentleman&#39;s cutter &#39;Fortuna&#39;.</p>
full_description: '<p><em>Fortuna</em>, a gaff cutter, was found off Cockham Slip
  upstream of Hoo on the Medway. She was owned by Dr Clark and her blue Registration
  Book showed she had been built in 1880 as a steam launch. Subsequently she had been
  converted to a yacht. It was decided to give her a third reincarnation and make
  a plug from her to build a new class of yachts to race on the Thames.</p>

  <p>Harry Hutchinson found <em>Katie</em> as an abandoned project on the Thames and
  took her to Lymington. Subsequently she moved to the East Coast with new owners,
  in 2010, and sailed regularly in OGA events. She was sold in 2016.</p>

  <p>Her sister ship, <em>Chickpea</em>, has been fitted out for cruising with a cabin.</p>'
