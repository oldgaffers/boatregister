short_description: Built in 1912 by Gann & Palmer in Teignmouth as a Gentleman's Yacht,
  White Cloud has pitch pine planking on elm frames. Ashore for over 12 years, she
  was re-launched September 2013 after a thorough restoration by Les Weeks lasting
  nearly six years. In 2012 Les received a Transport Trust Restoration Award for his
  work on White Cloud.
full_description: '<p>Bought, whilst ashore, by Les Weeks in 2007 as a project for
  forthcoming retirement, the restoration sadly failed to be completed in time for
  her centenary in 2012. Robert Taylor had previously started the restoration, but
  sadly died after owning her for just a year, having only managed to remove the rotten
  cabin top and coamings.</p>

  <p>Built in Teignmouth in 1912 by Gann &amp; Palmer, whose business ended when their
  yard was destroyed by fire, ''White Cloud'' is obviously based on the lines of a
  Falmouth Quay Punt, and is gaff rigged with a Bermudan (leg of mutton) mizzen. She
  has a straight stem and transom stern and is 25ft along the deck and waterline.
  With bowsprit and bumpkin she''ll be about 35ft in total.</p>

  <p>Despite being 100 years old, the pitch pine planking was all in good condition
  and only five frames needed attention. All the nails and roves needed hardening
  up and the other original, galvanised, fixings were merely a memory of rust! Notes
  from the registrar of ships suggested that she was built for a ''Gentleman'' (Col.
  Golightly of Torquay), however documents at the Teignmouth and Shaldon Museum (who
  have some of the yard records) say that she was orderd by, and built for, Peter
  Hoare of the famous banking family. She has an impressive list of previous owners
  (including Lord Cranbrook in the late 1920s).</p>

  <p>Les Weeks'' restoration is as ''in keeping'' as possible, but with no original
  accommodation plans, this was slightly imaginative. He was fortunate to meet some
  of the previous owners, one of whom sailed her to Finland, with wife and three daughters,
  in the early 1950s. Hopefully she''ll still be that seaworthy when restored.</p>

  <p>In 2012 Les received a Transort Trust Restoration Award for his work in restoring
  ''White Cloud''.</p>

  <p>Finally re-launched in September 2013, she had one outing in October before the
  season ended. In 2014 she sailed on the Blackwater and in September entered the
  Maldon Town Regatta where the first, post restoration, photos of her afloat were
  taken.</p>

  <p>The next priority was some new sails as some of the existing ones were date stamped
  1963! The replacements were designed and made by Mark Butler at James Lawrence in
  Brightingsea, in 2015-16. After about ten years at Downs Road Boatyard in Maldon,
  including six for the restoration, in 2015 ''White Cloud'' was moved to Bradwell
  Marina, still flying the burgee of the Maldon Little Ship Club (MLSC).</p>

  <p>Sold in 2019 to Paul Stevens who sailed her to Portugal in 2019, returning in
  2020 after the ports reopened. Now based in Calstock Cornwall. As her owner I would
  like to pay tribute the fantastic job Les did, enabling me to enjoy this lovely
  boat to the full.&nbsp;</p>'
