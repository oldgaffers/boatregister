  Built in 1912 by Gann & Palmer in Teignmouth as a Gentleman's Yacht, White Cloud
  has pitch pine planking on elm frames. Ashore for over 12 years, she was
  re-launched September 2013 after a thorough restoration by Les Weeks lasting
  nearly six years. In 2012 Les received a Transport Trust Restoration Award for
  his work on White Cloud.

  Bought, whilst ashore, by Les Weeks in 2007 as a project for forthcoming
  retirement, the restoration sadly failed to be completed in time for her
  centenary in 2012. Robert Taylor had previously started the restoration, but
  sadly died after owning her for just a year, having only managed to remove the
  rotten cabin top and coamings.


  Built in Teignmouth in 1912 by Gann & Palmer, whose business ended when their
  yard was destroyed by fire, 'White Cloud' is obviously based on the lines of a
  Falmouth Quay Punt, and is gaff rigged with a Bermudan (leg of mutton) mizzen.
  She has a straight stem and transom stern and is 25ft along the deck and
  waterline. With bowsprit and bumpkin she'll be about 35ft in total.


  Despite being 100 years old, the pitch pine planking was all in good condition
  and only five frames needed attention. All the nails and roves needed hardening
  up and the other original, galvanised, fixings were merely a memory of rust!
  Notes from the registrar of ships suggested that she was built for a 'Gentleman'
  (Col. Golightly of Torquay), however documents at the Teignmouth and Shaldon
  Museum (who have some of the yard records) say that she was orderd by, and built
  for, Peter Hoare of the famous banking family. She has an impressive list of
  previous owners (including Lord Cranbrook in the late 1920s).


  Les Weeks' restoration is as 'in keeping' as possible, but with no original
  accommodation plans, this was slightly imaginative. He was fortunate to meet
  some of the previous owners, one of whom sailed her to Finland, with wife and
  three daughters, in the early 1950s. Hopefully she'll still be that seaworthy
  when restored.


  In 2012 Les received a Transort Trust Restoration Award for his work in
  restoring 'White Cloud'.


  Finally re-launched in September 2013, she had one outing in October before the
  season ended. In 2014 she sailed on the Blackwater and in September entered the
  Maldon Town Regatta where the first, post restoration, photos of her afloat were
  taken.


  The next priority was some new sails as some of the existing ones were date
  stamped 1963! The replacements were designed and made by Mark Butler at James
  Lawrence in Brightingsea, in 2015-16. After about ten years at Downs Road
  Boatyard in Maldon, including six for the restoration, in 2015 'White Cloud' was
  moved to Bradwell Marina, still flying the burgee of the Maldon Little Ship Club
  (MLSC).


  Sold in 2019 to Paul Stevens who sailed her to Portugal in 2019, returning in
  2020 after the ports reopened. Paul paid tribute the fantastic job Les did, enabling him to enjoy this lovely boat to the
  full.
