full_description: Her shallow draft with stub bilge keels is ideal for investigating
  creeks and rivers, but she is just as happy on coastal waters.  <p> The absence
  of a centreboard makes her surprisingly roomy for her size and she can easily take
  4 in comfort. <p> Sarah Grace is kept in a dry barn on her trailer so she is ready
  to go within a few minutes. Her unstayed mast and single loose footed lugsail means
  she can be rigged within seconds either on the trailer at the slip or on the water.
  <p> Her auxilliary power is a 2.5hp Honda outboard. <p> These are super little day
  boats and are renowned for their seakeeping abilities
