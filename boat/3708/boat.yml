full_description: '<p>Luely is a sharpie - as in the traditional type from America''s
  Eastern Seaboard - designed by Iain Oughtred. Iain''s design is called the ''Haiku'',
  which took as inspiration the famous sharpie ''Egret'' designed by Commodore Ralph
  Munroe in the 1880''s. With his usual flair, Iain considerably developed the concept
  and introduced some significant changes including twin centreboards, better accommodation,
  a change from ketch to yawl and a lifting rudder. Importantly though, he has remained
  true to the type''s vital characteristics like the free-standing masts.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>Before Luely''s launch in 2020, only one other example of an Oughtred Haiku had
  been built. However, Luely is the first to be built faithfully to Iain''s plans
  (except for the mainmast which, with his enthusiastic blessing, was built from carbon
  fibre instead of wood, to save weight aloft). Auxiliary power is provided by an
  electric pod motor with folding propeller.</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>Being of such shallow draft, Luely is ideally suited to estuaries and likes nothing
  better than to dry out on the mud. For this reason, she can be spotted sailing on
  the Solway coast (Scottish side), but being a trailer-dweller and perfectly capable
  in open water, will also pop up on any of our other coasts from time to time!</p>'
