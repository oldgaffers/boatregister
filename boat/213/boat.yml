short_description: |-
  The oldest smack on the East Coast, and possibly the oldest sailing vessel in
  Europe, or the world, she was rebuilt by Mike Frost in the 1960s and is
  currently owned and sailed by two of his grandchildren.
full_description: |-
  Built in 1808 by James Williamson of Maldon, Essex, the oyster smack, Boadicea
  was worked commercially until 1938 when she passed into the hands of the current
  owner's grandfather, Michael Frost for Â£175.


  Since being built she's been repaired and renovated many times, but changed
  hands only a dozen or so times. She had an engine fitted in the 1970s. The boat
  continues to work for pleasure, racing in the summer and drifting for herring in
  autumn, keeping the old East Coast sailing skills alive.


  Reuben Frost believes she's still sailing 'because she's always been loved.'
