full_description: "<p>Built in 1808 by James Williamson of Maldon, Essex, the oyster\
  \ smack, Boadicea was worked commercially until 1938 when she passed into the hands\
  \ of the current owner&#39;s grandfather, Michael Frost for &pound;175.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>Since being built she&#39;s been repaired and renovated many times, but changed\
  \ hands only a dozen or so times. She had an engine fitted in the 1970s. The boat\
  \ continues to work for pleasure, racing in the summer and drifting for herring\
  \ in autumn, keeping the old East Coast sailing skills alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuben\
  \ Frost believes she&#39;s still sailing &#39;because she&#39;s always been loved.&#39;</p>"
