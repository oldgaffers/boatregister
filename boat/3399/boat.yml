short_description: Pajaro is a very pretty 23ft Bermudan rigged classic wooden dayboat.
full_description: Pajaro is a very pretty wooden dayboat evidently of Scandinavian
  design, being similar to a BB17 or a mini-Dragon. It is thought that she may also
  be Scandinavian built, although the mahogany beamshelf suggests that she may instead
  be Clyde built, as rumour in that area suggests, and where she was known to be active
  in the 1970&#39;s.</p><p>She&nbsp;was rescued from prolonged storage ashore at Ardfern
  to be comprehensively and sympathetically rebuilt and restored over several years
  (to 2013) by shipwright&nbsp;Gordon MacNair at&nbsp;Ardrishaig. She was brought
  into commission but very lightly used for a single season in Loch Fyne before being
  stored ashore at Ardrishaig. She was&nbsp;subsequently sold in 2016 after which
  she was kept at Rhu on the Gare Loch.</p><p>On transfer to the current ownership
  in late January 2019, she was transported to Cornwall where she has been laid up
  ashore under cover.</p><p>Her provenance is uncertain as she has no original builder&#39;s
  marks or plate other than that of Gordon MacNair who carried out the major restoration
  works.</p>
