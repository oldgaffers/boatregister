full_description: |-
  *Wyvern* is a replica “pinky,” a fishing type that was popular in New England
  and the Canadian Maritime Provinces from the mid- 18th to early 20th centuries.
  She was built by McConnell Marine Ltd at Parry Sound, a  port in Georgian Bay on
  the east side of Lake Huron, and spent her first 26  years at Port Hawkesbury
  and Halifax, Nova Scotia, under the names *A E Huston*,  then *Caper Dreams*,
  then to Kinsale, Virginia, name *Arcturus*.


  The Institute  of Maritime History, a non-profit volunteer society dedicated to
  history and  underwater archaeology, now uses her for experimental archaeology,
  training, reconnaissance, and diving, mainly in the Chesapeake Bay.
