short_description: "The Rouiller Brother's &#34;Norwegian&#34; boats (2 were built\
  \ for use on Lake Geneva) are a light displacement version of the classic Norwegian\
  \ double-ended cutter, with at &#34;fin keel&#34; below a shallow V hull. After\
  \ WWII, due to lack of copper rivets, planking had to stop for 1 year, and due to\
  \ lack of lead, an iron scrap in concrete keel was used. I am now in the process\
  \ of rebuilding the keel fin\_ + lead bottom, and plan to launch Hetaire summer\
  \ of 2021\\. (The &#34;Hetaires&#34; were the consorts of Greek philosophers!)"
