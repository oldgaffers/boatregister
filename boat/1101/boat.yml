    She had a major refit in 2005 which included a new engine, spars, rigging and
    sails. The current owner purchased her in 2008 and has maintained her regularly
    to keep her in excellent overall condition. Windflower has been kept ashore undercover
    in the winter months and comes with her own cradle and full winter cover. Her
    sail inventory has been continually upgraded along with her running and standing
    rigging.<p>More details at the <a href="http://www.sandemanyachtcompany.co.uk/yacht/575/WINDFLOWER">Sandeman
