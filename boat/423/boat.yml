  sales_text: <p>Hillyard 4 ton gaff cutter built 1937 at Littlehampton. Pitch pine
    on oak. Moored at Holyhead during summer and stored ashore in a secure yard on
    it"s own cradle (included in sale) during winter where it is cleaned, painted
    annually. The 13.5 bhp Beta diesel was installed by and is serviced by Stuart
    Marine at Holyhead. Par marine toilet. Simrad tiller pilot. Kelvin Hughes VHF.
    NASA solar panel battery charger. All standing rigging renewed 2013. All running
    rigging renewed 2015. So, the boat is going well but the same can"t be said of
    the 1936-built owner who is reluctantly looking for a younger person to take over
    the helm.</p>
