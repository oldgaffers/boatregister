full_description: "<p>62-year-old Philip Kerin, a British citizen based in the Caribbean,\
  \ was rescued on 12 September 2004 whilst sailing from Antigua to Falmouth. His\
  \ stricken 19th century yacht, &#39;Dunlin&#39;, was nearly 350 miles out in the\
  \ Atlantic. Coastguards received a satellite signal from an emergency beacon 345\
  \ miles south-west of the Isles of Scilly. A Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft from\
  \ RAF Kinloss, Scotland, was scrambled. The MV Sydney Express responded to an emergency\
  \ call sent out by the coastguards, and picked up Mr. Kerin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;Dunlin&#39;\
  \ had been well known in classic yacht circles as a regular at events in Antigua.\
  \ The 28&#39; Camper and Nicholson sailed all three races in 1999 despite breaking\
  \ off the end of her bowsprit in the first race. Built in 1890 as a Falmouth Quay\
  \ Punt she was the oldest boat present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nalu9qcgFf4C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=1890+yacht+dunlin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M6Bbt3VTaS&amp;sig=nfw8h-g8hsQl6R9cN_MQ-HDAOPU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LoNdVNzVI8nXapvLgMAP&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=1890%20yacht%20dunlin&amp;f=false\"\
