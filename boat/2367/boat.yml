    Much admired and very well equipped Norske 35 ferrocement gaff cutter
    professionally built in 1978 by Windboats of Wroxham. GRP balsa core deck which
    is lightweight, virtually maintenance free and waterproof. Windboats have
    a great reputation for build quality and we have met a number of other Norske
    35's over the years including one that has circumnavigated plus Norske also built
    the Endurance range which went on to be built in Fibreglass. Fully
    refitted in 1998 with new Noble hollow mast, rigging, seacocks and much more
    over the years. Sleeps four in two cabins plus a couple of pipe cots.

    We are the second owners but having owned her for 27 seasons we are with
    our advancing years regretfully passing her on. She has cruised from Scotland
    to LaRochelle over the years and has taken part in a number of Brest and Paimpol
    festivals along with cruising and racing with the Old Gaffers Association, attending
    more Yarmouth Old Gaffers and other events than we remember! We have a healthy supply of trophies.
