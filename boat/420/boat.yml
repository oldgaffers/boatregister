full_description: "<p><em>Mersey</em> was one of ten Rivers Class Yachts built by\
  \ William &nbsp;Crossfield and Sons in Arnside for the River Mersey Yacht Club.\
  \ Six were &nbsp;built in 1912 with a further four in 1914. Five Rivers Class yachts\
  \ are &nbsp;thought to be still in existence: Arnside Sailing Club\u2019s \u201C\
  Severn\u201D &nbsp;'Deva', 'Dart', 'Styx' (all on the OGA Register) and 'Esk'.</p>\n\
  <p>The &nbsp;Rivers Class were used largely for evening racing with a season running\
  \ &nbsp;from May to July, with regatta race in July. The boats were also raced &nbsp;in\
  \ August at the Straits Regatta on Anglesey. They were raced for prize &nbsp;money.\
  \ In 1914 prize money was \xA344 when the average wage was \xA367. The &nbsp;Royal\
  \ Mersey Yacht Club was based in Rock Ferry, a then prosperous area &nbsp;of Birkenhead\
  \ with large houses overlooking the river.</p>\n<p>The &nbsp;design was based upon\
  \ the Blackpool and Fleetwood Jewel Class. The boats &nbsp;were originally opened\
  \ decked. They had a crew of three. The boats cost &nbsp;\xA350 each delivered afloat\
  \ with a further \xA314.18s for the sails. (In &nbsp;total \xA34000 in 2021 prices,\
  \ labour was a lot cheaper then).</p>\n<p><em>Mersey</em> was the flagship of the\
  \ class being owned by Charles Livingstone, the &nbsp;Vice Commodore of the Club.\
  \ The Commodore, an honorary position was the &nbsp;17th Earl of Derby. Charles\
  \ was related to the founders of the Cunard &nbsp;and MacIver Shipping Lines. He\
  \ owned <em>Aruda</em>a 30 tonne yacht and went on to own<em> Kentra</em>, an 85\
  \ foot, 94 tonne yacht built by Fifes in Scotland. <em>Kentra</em> is still in existence\
  \ and has been sailed round the world. Charles &nbsp;lived in the centre of Liverpool\
  \ in a large Georgian house on Dale St. &nbsp;Under Charles Livingstone, Mersey\
  \ won one race in 1914.</p>\n<p>In 1914 <em>Mersey </em>was brought by Lt Hugh McNeille-Gibb,\
  \ first officer of HMS<em> Conway</em>, &nbsp;a merchant navy training ship anchored\
  \ in the Mersey off Rock Ferry. At &nbsp;the same time his commanding officer Captain\
  \ Harvey Broadbent acquired &nbsp;Arnside Sailing Club\u2019s <em>Severn</em>, then\
  \ known as <em>Ribble</em>. &nbsp;At one stage Hugh worked for the White Star Line.\
  \ Hugh McNeille-Gibb was a better sailor than his commanding officer, owning a succession\
  \ of &nbsp;larger yachts including <em>Inknoo</em>, which was later owned by Joe\
  \ Wallace, who restored <em>Severn </em>after she was raised from the bed of the\
  \ Mersey. One of Hugh\u2019s yachts <em>Caird </em>had to be re-handicapped to stop\
  \ him winning so many races.</p>\n<p>After the First World War <em>Mersey </em>was\
  \ owned by S. McLauchlan in partnership with a succession of other people till 1937.\
  \ <em>Mersey </em>won &nbsp;the Rivers Class series 10 times making her the most\
  \ successful boat. &nbsp;In 1935 the Rivers Class were replaced by the Mylne Class.\
  \ &nbsp;S.McLauchlan &nbsp;was instrumental in the selection of the new class. The\
  \ flagship of &nbsp;Mylne Class was also called \u201C<em>Mersey</em>\u201D. She\
  \ was owned by the Earl of Derby, the club\u2019s Commodore.</p>\n<p>In 1939 Lloyds\
  \ Register, <em>Mersey</em> is recorded as being owned by A.Manson of West Kirby\
  \ in the Wirral. He was a member of the Royal Mersey Yacht and the West Kirby Sailing\
  \ Club. &nbsp;There are entries for <em>Mersey</em> in 1947 and 48 Registers. The\
  \ &nbsp;boat is recorded as being in Birkenhead though the owner is not named. &nbsp;She\
  \ might briefly have been used as a fishing boat in the River Dee.</p>\n<p>Either\
  \ just before the Second World War or after it, <em>Mersey </em>was &nbsp;moved\
  \ to Pwllheli and then to Aberystwyth. In 1987 she was owned by &nbsp;Gron Davies,\
  \ who mentions that he was restoring her in a letter to the Gaffers Log.</p>"
