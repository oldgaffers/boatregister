full_description: "Dreva was built in 1936 for George Romney Fox (1898 \u2013 1968),\
  \ a Falmouth timber merchant. Designed by Nigel Warrington Smyth, a talented amateur\
  \ designer based in the West Country.  Her bold sheer is said to be typical of his\
  \ designs.  There is a brief summary of some of her early history and a lines drawing\
  \ in the Gaffers Log 1983/2. Romney Fox owned her for 30 years and sailed her extensively\
  \ in the English Channel. Her second owner was J. Bart Pot, a Dutch engineer based\
  \ in London. He replaced the engine, added a doghouse and wheel steering, and kept\
  \ her at Gosport. There she regularly raced with the South Coast OGA and in Barts\
  \ hands she almost invariably won something.  He cruised in the Channel and also\
  \ made several trips to Holland. The photo shows Dreva in the EC race in 1974, the\
  \ day before the start of the Heineken rally to Amsterdam in which she took part.\
  \  Dreva is a large boat for her size, heavily built and very robust and seaworthy.\
  \  Bart took her out in all weathers but it was hardly ever necessary to reef the\
  \ mainsail. He kept her for 10 years. Subsequent owners removed the doghouse so\
  \ her appearance is more in keeping with the original. <p>> is an old Cornish name,\
  \ sometimes pronounced  \u2018dreeva\u2019.  Both Romney Fox and Bart Pot however\
  \ called her \u2018dreva\u2019 ( rhymes with clever)."
