full_description: <p>&#39;Ferryman&#39; is a Tormentor 5 tonner. Her design is based
  on that of The Itchen ferries and she maintains some characteristics of them. The
  Tormentors were built post World War 2 as an attempt at reducing the cost of yachts.
  The cost would have been &pound;960, similar yachts would then have ranged in price
  between &pound;1250 and &pound;1950.</p>
