  *Ferryman* is a Tormentor 5 tonner. Her design is based on that
  of The Itchen ferries and she maintains some characteristics of them. The Tormentors
  were built post World War 2 as an attempt at reducing the cost of yachts. The
  cost would have been £3960, similar yachts would then have ranged in price
  between £1250 and £1950.
