short_description: |-
  Beautiful capable daysailer for day trips, road adventures and coastal
  exploration or a nice sail down the lake and beach for a picnick or BBQ.
full_description: |-
  A great little boat - very stable with her long ballast keel and shoal draft,
  she is the perfect boat for a day about the coast or lake and exploring even the
  shallowest bay. Easy to sail singlehanded, with very comfortable movement
  through waves for her size and ample space inside for up to six people and
  picnic or overnight gear.


  The forward floor can be raised to seat level and form a nice platform to sleep
  two people under the spray hood.


  The spray hood provides comfy shelter in a squall and the 3.5hp Mercury engine
  in the outboard well takes her easily up to 5kts should the wind let you down.


  The boat is also easily launched and recovered on a slip- way with her very good
  braked trailer.


  The build quality is excellent and she is in beautiful con- dition, having seen
  very light use and been well looked after.


  Including two wheel braked road trailer, 3.5hp Mercury engine, Spray hood, Full
  Cover, Sail cover, Jeckell’s sails and fenders.
