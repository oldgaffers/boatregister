full_description: Mentioned by Eric Hiscock in Cruising Under Sail, Wingoes was a
  live-aboard first in the Hamble and then in the river Fal for many years from 1964,
  first off Flushing and then in Sailors Creek. After her death she was sold and kept
  ashore at Falmouth Marina. She was in need of some internal woodwork when she was
  lifted out and suffered more deterioration thereafter.  Soon after in September
  2003 she was lying Portleven and for sale by member Bob Allan in Gaffers Log as
  a part finished rebuild with all her drawings and plans, all the beams and carlins
  ready, and in a clean state but still 10 new planks and a new deck.  Her current
  location and condition is not known.
