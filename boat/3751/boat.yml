  *Diric* takes her name from her first owners Richard and Diane, who lived in
  Yarmouth IoW. Built of the best materials (carvel round bilge mahogany on oak,
  lead keel, canvas covered decks). Yanmar GM10 inboard diesel. Bought by Nick and
  Jill Bredon in 2008, who undertook an extensive refit/rebuild at the Classic
  Boat Museaum, Newport IoW. In 2010, 'Diane' was winner of the YOGAFF Concourse
  d'Elegance. Her current owner Edmund Hewitt just had Nick Gates, Emsworth give
  Diric, and extensive refit costing some Â£24,000, including all the varnished
  brightwork on the cabin and coamings around the large cockpit. Comfortable and
  cosy 2 berth cabin with fitted head. She has no electronics currently but there
  are places for echo, vhf and an electronic log. Very capable, fully equipped and
  ready to sail, Diric has been kept ashore in the winter months and comes with
  her own craddle/props. Well cared for in family ownership. Lying Hayling Island
  Sailing Club moorings, Chichester Harbour.
