full_description: "<p>&#39;Anjak&#39; was home built in 1967/8 and the W Atkin design\
  \ was stretched from 27&#39; to 32&#39; with the rig changed from schooner to cutter.\
  \ Her builder, John Brown, owned her until 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is rigged for\
  \ easy single handed sailing and has a deck stepped mast and shallow draft suitable\
  \ for the French canals. The internal layout designed and fitted by Mick Tyrrell,\
  \ is extremely spacious and practical. With multiple easy-access storage cupboards,\
  \ the full 9&rsquo; beam cabin top allows for plenty of storage, with 5&rsquo;10&rdquo;\
  \ standing headroom throughout the main living space. This &lsquo;tardis&rsquo;\
  \ effect has to be seen to be appreciated. &#39;Anjak&#39; has four comfortable\
  \ full-size berths with one that easily converts to a double, making five in total.\
  \ The toilet compartment has a solid door with hot/cold washing facility.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>The roomy cabin has a comfortable cosy atmosphere, with heat and light created\
  \ by wall fixed gimballed oil lamps. The decks and the wide non-slip cabin top provide\
  \ a very uncluttered area that is easy to negotiate when working and spacious for\
  \ relaxing on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout Mick Tyrrell&rsquo;s 25 years of ownership\
  \ he has thoroughly maintained &#39;Anjak&#39; in excellent condition and continually\
  \ improved her facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Anjak&#39; won many races during membership\
  \ of the Medway Cruising Club, and given her owners, Mick and Hazel Tyrrell much\
  \ pleasure sailing around the Medway and east coast area and beyond.</p>"
