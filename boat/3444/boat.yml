full_description: <i>Shaula</i> is a Loch Fyne Cutter built by Alun Edmunds on the
  Island of Skye.  Alun named her Rachel Anne and fished from her for two seasons.  In
  1989 Dominic Partridge bought her and changed the name to Shaula.  Dominic converted
  her to a sailing yacht and spent the next twenty years  cruising her extensively
  travelling to Norway and the Mediterranean.   In 2015 the current owner, Stephen
  Greig, bought her    and replaced the mast and rigging. He sailed her from Dartmouth
  to Liverpool    and then Milford Haven where she is based now.</p>    <p>Shaula
  is robustly built with a generous beam, long keel,     straight stem, distinctive
  pointed stern and steeply raked stern     post with the rudder hung on the back.     She
  is planked in 1 &frac14;&rdquo; larch on 5&rdquo; x 2&rdquo; sawn oak frames.
