short_description: <p>Converted to gaff cutter from Bermudan sloop in 2000. She has
  had her plate removed and full size iroko bilge keels have been added by Robertsons
  of Woodbridge plus other works by them. The plate case was filled with lead and
  iron to compensate for the loss of plate weight.</p>

  \ etc., Mr Reeves purchased her around 2000 and converted her to a gaff cutter.</p>\r\
