short_description: |-
  *Mallard* is a Clovelly Picarooner.
full_description: |-
  Terry and Martin Heard based the design of their Clovelly Picarooner
  on the small herring boats of Clovelly. They were built to be fast and with shallow
  draft so they could net the catch and return quickly over the bar to gain the
  best prices for their fish. Skippers of the bigger vessels nicknamed them 'picarooners'
  (derived from the Spanish/Portugese for pirates) as they were able to steal a
  precious part of the trade!
  
  The Picarooner is the smallest of the Heard
  boats but sails like a much bigger vessel than her 15'6".
  Mallard was fitted out by David Sexton between 2011 and 2013. Malcom Goram increased
  the rudder area, lengthened the bowsprit, adapted a 5hp outboard into a well and
  provided a new suit of sails in 2016. In 2017 she visited the Morbihan in Brittany.
