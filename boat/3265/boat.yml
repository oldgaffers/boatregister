full_description: "<p>Terry and Martin Heard based the design of their Clovelly Picarooner\
  \ on the small herring boats of Clovelly. They were built to be fast and with shallow\
  \ draft so they could net the catch and return quickly over the bar to gain the\
  \ best prices for their fish. Skippers of the bigger vessels nicknamed them &#39;picarooners&#39;\
  \ (derived from the Spanish/Portugese for pirates) as they were able to steal a\
  \ precious part of the trade!<br />\r\nThe Picarooner is the smallest of the Heard\
  \ boats but sails like a much bigger vessel than here 15&#39;6&quot;!<br />\r\n\
  Mallard was fitted out by David Sexton between 2011 &amp; 2013. Malcom Goram increased\
  \ the rudder area, lengthened the bowsprit, adapted a 5hp outboard into a well and\
  \ provided a new suit of sails in 2016. In 2017 she visited the Morbihan in Brittany.</p>"
