short_description: Under the inspiration of a big Mylne ketch, Jeremy Lines designed
  this rather smaller (50' on deck) centreboard version for his friend Mark Varvill.
  Drawn entirely by hand in the traditional manner, with not a millimetre or computer
  mouse in sight, she is built of inch and a quarter mahogany, glued and screwed to
  laminated mahogany frames.
full_description: 'Betty Alan was the dream boat of Mark Varvill, who commissioned
  her design from his friend Jeremy Lines, a yacht designer who trained with Fred
  Parker and worked his entire life at Camper and Nicholson. She supposedly had her
  inspiration from an 80'' Mylne ketch, and while her sheer line and ends show this
  inspiration her broad beam and centreboard are a practical response to the demands
  of British coastal cruising. Her hull construction is inch and a quarter mahogany
  glued and screwed on laminated mahogany frames, with laminated mahogany ring frames
  in way of her masts.<p>Glassed below the waterline, she has a teak deck over marine
  ply, and a wooden centreboard within ballast keel. Her hull was built to a high
  standard by Lathams in Poole, and she was finished by Mark Varvill in West Wittering
  before her launch in Birdham Pool in 1998, under her original name of Diligent II.<p>She
  was originally fitted out more or less as a day sailer, with an engine but almost
  no electronics and no winches. Everything was done with tackles. Varvill very sadly
  died prematurely, after having seen the boat winning her class in the 2001 Jubilee
  Regatta Round the Island Race. The boat was bought by Peter Muir who commissioned
  a thorough refit by Berthons for world cruising, including winches and a bow thruster,
  which makes her a very practical family boat, easily sailed by her very average
  husband and wife team.<p>On the other hand, when in regatta mode, her full complement
  of seven upwind sails means that a crew of a dozen can each have their own string!
  She was accidentally bought by Ed &amp; Frances Maggs, &ldquo;We didn''t mean to
  buy a Gaffer&rdquo;, during a boatless summer caused by breaking the mast of their
  Stella in summer 2011. The boat, in a manoeuvre many &#39;owners&#39; will be familiar
  with, rather stuck her paw out at them from between the bars of the Lymington Boat''s
  Home, and adopted them as her new parents. So far they have been delighted with
  her, and their only regret is that work has not yet allowed them to undertake the
  long cruise they dream of: cruising was initially limited to their home waters of
  the East Coast, Netherlands, Orkney, Cornwall, Channel Islands and Brittany.<p>More
  recently she has been undertaking a slow exploration of the West Coast of Ireland.
