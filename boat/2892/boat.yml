full_description: |-
  Crescent Moon is a smack type yacht, built by William Fox in Kings Lynn in 1914.
  But we know nothing more about the builder, of whether he worked in a boat yard
  or as an individual. 


  She has a square counter-stern similar to a fishing smack, with a rounded bow
  that is more  typical of a pleasure yacht of her day. She was built as a
  pleasure yacht, with  paraffin engine, and is said to have been built as a
  retirement gift for the owner of a boatyard.  


  Originally she was built as a gaff cutter, complete with a retracting topmast
  and tops'l , but was converted to bermudan rig in the early 1950's. In 1922 she
  had a major refurbishment at Kings boat yard in Pin Mill, which included
  converting her back to gaff rig, as renewing the decks. Her home port has been
  at Pin Mill on the river Orwell since the late 1980's.
