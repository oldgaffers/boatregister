  great condtion.  One of her best features is her beautifiul varnished pine deck
  and coacroof that make here very distinctive.
full_description: |-
  *Crescent Moon* is a smack type yacht, built by William Fox in Kings Lynn in
  1914. But we know nothing more about the builder, of whether he worked in a boat
  yard or as an individual.

  She has a square counter-stern similar to a fishing smack, with a rounded bow
  that is more  typical of a pleasure yacht of her day. She was built as a
  pleasure yacht, with  paraffin engine, and is said to have been built as a
  retirement gift for the owner of a boatyard.

  Originally she was built as a gaff cutter, complete with a retracting topmast
  and tops'l , but was converted to bermudan rig in the early 1950's. In 1922 she
  had a major refurbishment at Kings boat yard in Pin Mill, which included
  converting her back to gaff rig, as renewing the decks. Her home port has been
  at Pin Mill on the river Orwell since the late 1980's.

    *Crescent Moon* is a 32' long gaff cutter built in Kings Lynn in 1914.  She is a
    true one-off, with a fishing smack like counter stern, and a more yacht looking
    curved bow.   She is in excellent structural condition, built of pitch pine
    planks on oak frames. She can sleep up to 5 people and has been well used by us
    in our ownership for east coast cruising.

    We've undertaken a programme of continual improvements in our 9 year ownership
    and all aspects of her are fully sorted out and in great shape.

    *Crescent Moon* is a beautiful boat and is a joy to be on, with her fully
    varnished coach-roof and decks.

    We are only selling her due to our retirement and wish to do some blue water
    offshore sailing.

    She is ashore at Pin Mill in Suffolk and ready to sail.
