  was once owned by Maurice Griffiths.</p>
full_description: "<p>&lsquo;Wilful&rsquo; was the cover picture on the Old Gaffers\
  \ Association Newsletter, 1977/4. The following article is taken from that issue.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>The first picture we have been able to publish of a gaffer carrying\
  \ her OGA Race number on her sail &lsquo;Wilful&rsquo; was designed and built by\
  \ C. Sibbick of Cowes in 1899, and was formerly named &lsquo;Norken&rsquo;, then\
  \ &lsquo;Melody&rsquo;. In 1911 she moved to the East Coast, where she stayed until\
  \ 1975. In 1928, she was owned by Maurice Griffiths, who described he in some of\
  \ his books.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Mike Willett brought her into the OGA\
  \ fleet when he bought her in 1971. Mike added the coachroof, and replaced the small\
  \ steering well described by Maurice Griffiths with the larger cockpit. In 1975,\
  \ Mike sold &lsquo;Wilful&rsquo; to Johathan Ward-Hayne, who took her round to join\
  \ the newly-formed South Western fleet.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The stem\
  \ is slightly rounded above the water, and fairly well cut away below. While she\
  \ is pretty lean bowed, there is sufficient flare to prevent her digging in until\
  \ conditions get really severe, but she has a very lively pitching motion which\
  \ I am trying to smooth out by spreading the ballast more. As can be imagined from\
  \ the amount of ballast she is as stiff as a church, for an 8 tonner, that is.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>The saloon contains two settee berths and most important, the\
  \ coal stove. The galley is just abaft the mast, sink to port and gas cooker&#39;\
  \ to starboard. There is a well placed skylight giving headroom there. Forward of\
  \ the mast is the head and two pipe cots. The saloon is all varnished, and with\
  \ all the frames visible is pleasantly old fashioned, while the foc&#39;sle is white\
  \ painted for light, and to encourage cleanliness.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Plans\
  \ for the future include replacing the wire main halliards which run on very inefficient\
  \ winches with rope pulley-hauley ones, and having a squaresail made for downwind\
  \ cruising, as I hate spinnakers.</blockquote>"
