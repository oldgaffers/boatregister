full_description: "<p>Built in 1923, &#39;Squib&#39; is a Westcliff One Design, thought\
  \ to be the only one surviving. She was designed by Norman Dallimore and built by\
  \ Cole &amp; Wiggins. Her first owner was Squire Taylor. She competed in Southend\
  \ Yachting Week in the 1920s with some success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was kept on the\
  \ River Crouch until the 1930s, and following new ownership was moved to the north\
  \ east coast and is recorded in the Royal Northumberland YC yearbook from 1939.&nbsp;</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1949 she was cast ashore at Blyth, resulting in serious damage but she\
  \ was rebuilt. She was dismasted off Blyth in 1956 and is recorded as being sailed\
  \ by Edward Cartner at Blyth, 1954 - 56.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1977 Rodney Mitchell sold\
  \ &#39;Squib&#39; to another RNYC member, Spencer Johnstone and about five or six\
  \ years later she was sold again to Graydon<br />\r\nDawson of Sunderland YC. Dawson\
  \ sailed her for two or three seasons and then laid her up ashore on a farm at Herrington.\
  \ In 1988 she was reported as being near derelict. Her next known owner (c1988)\
  \ was Dave Raggett, RNLI NE Division surveyor, who in turn sold her to Ian Fairclough.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Between 1996 and 1999, lan Fairclough had &#39;Squib&#39; totally restored.\
  \ Much of the hull was rebuilt by Mike Cussins at Blackburn. Ian himself re-decked\
  \ and re-rigged her with a new mast. New sails to the original plan were made by\
  \ W Sails of Leigh. In 1998 - 1999 she was based at Fleetwood Marina and used for\
  \ day sailing off the port and in the River Wyre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, she was\
  \ moved to Britanny.</p>"
