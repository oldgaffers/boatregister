full_description: "<p>A classic &lsquo;one-off&rsquo; gaff cutter, &#39;Romilda&#39;\
  \ has a remarkable history. Built in 1897 by James McKane, Guernsey, as a monumental\
  \ stone carrier, she was converted by Camper &amp; Nicholson to a &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo;s\
  \ yacht&rsquo; in 1926. She has a solid build, pitch pine on oak, with a period\
  \ &lsquo;feel&rsquo; interior of varnished mahogany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years\
  \ it was thought &#39;Romilda&#39; was a Channel Islands pilot boat. In the 1970s,\
  \ owner Fred Hillier visited the islands to find she was originally a British registered\
  \ trading ship carrying stone between the Channel Islands and France. She was first\
  \ registered in Poole, 1908 and again in 1921.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the outbreak of\
  \ the First World War she was placed in the munitions trade to supply the Somme.\
  \ For a period after the war she was a lightship supply vessel under sail in the\
  \ Western Approaches to the English Channel. Her original name was &#39;Pom Pom&#39;,\
  \ but with the advent of radio an Admirality Court Order changed her name to &#39;Romilda&#39;\
  \ to avoid confusion with the Pan Pan emergency procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1928,\
  \ when registered in Brixham, her name was removed from the register as she had\
  \ been sold to be broken up for scrap. However she was converted to a yacht, with\
  \ the addition of an engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fred Hillier discovered that during her\
  \ chequered career she probably lay sunk for a couple of years. At some stage her\
  \ original fantail stern was removed to the rudder stock, shortening her by some\
  \ six feet. She had a major refit in 1982 when in Fred Hillier&#39;s ownership,\
  \ and he sold her in 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1990s she lay in one of the old\
  \ building docks at Bucklers Hard. Following a fire in the cockpit, 1995, she was\
  \ declared an insurance write-off. She was subsequently bought by Owen Emmerson\
  \ who carried out an extensive refit and in 2006 she underwent a major restoration\
  \ at Turks Boatyard, Chatham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Ellis of Southbourne Sea Scouts\
  \ remembers life aboard &#39;Romilda&#39;:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I sailed aboard\
  \ &#39;Romilda&#39; for several years as a lad together with several others who\
  \ were (in the main) members of Southbourne Sea Scouts, Prinstead Harbour. Fred\
  \ (with a bump on his head) as he was affectionately called, kept &#39;Romilda&#39;\
  \ in a deep water mooring in the channel northside of Thorney Island heading toward\
  \ the RAF sailing club on the Island. Fred (with a dent in his head) because he\
  \ had the bump removed! lived up the hill from Parhams boatyard in Emsworth, that\
  \ yard fitted a new Volvo diesel engine in &#39;Romilda&#39; which according to\
  \ the yard foreman, &#39;could move her at 9 knots against the tide oe&#39;r Chichester\
  \ bar&#39;.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>As an aside I spent so many hours watching\
  \ true craftsmen produce the most wonderful Folkboats at this yard and have never\
  \ forgotten the carvel construction using finest mahogany, perhaps on oak? Certainly\
  \ the engine got us to Le Havre without fuss when the wind lapsed but you did wonder\
  \ if the old girl should be subjected to so much power. The decks were canvas covered,\
  \ cream with sand in paint, whilst the hull was black and spars varnished like the\
  \ cabin sides.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We had great fun walking the &#39;spike&#39;\
  \ up front and climbing the rigging which held baggywrinkle and parrafin nav. lights\
  \ in the stays. The anchor was a fisherman, bigger than me and only trusted to the\
  \ big lads or Fred. Down below the pine boarding was pickled in diesel and the galley\
  \ was left to port as you fell into the saloon before venturing forward to a seperate\
  \ cabin, heads and sail locker. My memory is a little vague on specifics but in\
  \ general, but I loved the whole experience of life aboard &#39;Romilda&#39;.</blockquote>"
