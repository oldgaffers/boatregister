  sales_text: '<div>Freda was designed by the Itchen Ferry maestro Dan Hatcher, using
    almost identical lines to his masterpiece Wonder. She was built in 1890 by Fay
    of Northam. It is believed that not only is she probably the most original Itchen
    Ferry working boat in existence but possibly the fastest on handicap as well.
    Hardly suprising when we discover her owner was Captain Sam Randall, a famous
    big boat racing skipper of the day.</div> <div>Details:</div> <div>Construction-
