full_description: |-
  Tom Tit was built as a show piece for a yacht painter and decorator, Ernest
  Cave, of Itchen Ferry near Southampton. She was probably designed by Alfred
  Payne. As far as is known she has always been varnished. She was restored during
  the 1990s using original materials throughout including cotton sails and all
  hemp rope. She has no engine or electrics, only an emergency outboard.


  She was voted by Classic Boat as no 2 of the worlds 200 best classic boats and
  had attended regattas in Saint Tropez, Risor, Switzerland, Douarnenez, and
  Flensberg.
