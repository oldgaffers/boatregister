full_description: |-
  The Hedwig Maria was built in 2000 in Livorno according to the original English
  construction drawings. The builder was a German shipbuilder who built the Hedwig
  Maria in his spare time. The name comes from the "Sponsor"; the builder's
  grandmother. Then fitted with his gaff rig in Denmark at Ebbe Anderson's yard;
  mast and other spars. Completed in 2004 at Ernst Schneider's yard in Gr√∂dersby
  (Germany). The boat is built entirely in teak and mahogany in the traditional
  caravel riveted manner. The Italian influences are clearly visible in the
  interior. The exterior mainly has the sturdy English working boat appearance. In
  April 2013, Hedwig Maria was brought to Zuidland with a low loader to implement
  our own "ideas", after which the first "journey" to Hellevoetsluis, the home
  port, started.
