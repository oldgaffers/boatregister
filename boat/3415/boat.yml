full_description: "<p>&#39;Betsy&#39; is a very pretty Bermudan yawl, designed by\
  \ W Easton, and&nbsp;built at W.Cooks Boatyard in Maldon in 1930&nbsp;for Major\
  \ Blewitt, D.S.O of Colchester. She has a long keel with a canoe stern and Bermudan\
  \ yawl cutter rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1934 she passed into the ownership of&nbsp;the\
  \ Royal Artillery Yacht Club who kept her until 1947. Her next two owners were also\
  \ Majors, before she passed into civilian hands in 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Betsy appears\
  \ in every Lloyds Register issued between 1931 and 1980 when the register ceased\
  \ to be published, so full information about her owners and&nbsp;engines is known\
  \ to that point. Her sails were originally made by Gowans, although by 1980 some\
  \ were also from Jeckells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>30 ft overall carvel planked, pitch pine\
