    *Marshmallow* is a 21foot  Blackwater Sloop built in Maldon by Dan Webb and
    Feesey c1968.  She is carvel and gaff rigged,  has two berths in cabin and pipe
    cot in focsle.  There is an original Baby Blake sea toilet,  Taylor’s stove and
    a Yanmar 1GM engine.  Engine was professionally serviced before Covid19
    restrictions and has not been used since.  The boat has been layed up ashore
    under covers at Rochford for several years. It is believed that she is in good
    structural condition but in need of some recaulking prior to paint and varnish.
     Sails are in good condition and dry stored.


    *Marshmallow* has been in the same ownership for the last 55 years and has
    sailed East Coast waters extensively out of Paglesham in Essex.  Sadly,  her
    owner and former OGA member passed away earlier this year and his family have
    asked me ( as his friend and sailing companion ) to try to find her a new owner.
     They are more interested in her finding the “ right” owner than in any money -
    although any donation to the RNLI in the memory of Ivor Henry Jones would be
    appreciated.
    If you are interested in *Marshmallow* please contact me through the OGA or directly by email (david.hanchet@btinternet.com) I can arrange for you to view her ashore at Sutton Wharf Boatyard ( Carter & Ward ) Rochford,  Essex.
