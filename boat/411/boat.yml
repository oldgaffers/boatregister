  sales_text: "*Marshmallow* is a 21foot  Blackwater Sloop built in Maldon by Dan
    Webb and\nFeesey c1968.  She is carvel and gaff rigged,  has two berths in cabin
    and pipe\ncot in focsle.  There is an original Baby Blake sea toilet,  Taylor’s
    stove and\na Yanmar 1GM engine.  Engine was professionally serviced before Covid19\n
    restrictions and has not been used since.  The boat has been layed up ashore\n
    under covers at Rochford for several years. It is believed that she is in good\n
    structural condition but in need of some recaulking prior to paint and varnish.\n
     Sails are in good condition and dry stored.\n\n\n*Marshmallow* has been in the
    same ownership for the last 55 years and has\nsailed East Coast waters extensively
    out of Paglesham in Essex.  Sadly,  her\nowner and former OGA member passed away
    earlier this year and his family have\nasked me ( as his friend and sailing companion
    ) to try to find her a new owner.\n They are more interested in her finding the
    “ right” owner than in any money -\nalthough any donation to the RNLI in the memory
    of Ivor Henry Jones would be\nappreciated. If you are interested in *Marshmallow*
    please contact\ndavid.hanchet@btinternet.com who can arrange for you to view her
    ashore at\nSutton Wharf Boatyard ( Carter & Ward ) Rochford, Essex."
