full_description: '<p>Brian Kennel the builder states: &quot;First produced in the
  early 1970s from one of the last wooden dinghies built by master craftsman Alf Last
  of Cooks Barge Yard Maldon; it has been evolving ever since. Early versions were
  sold to yacht and smack owners as tenders and many shells were fitted out by enthusiastic
  amateurs. By the late 1980&#39;s the mound was worn out and an injection of cash
  and enthusiasm was needed.&quot;</p>'
