full_description: |-
  Built by the owner to a high standard she is of Ferro-cement construction with a
  teak coach roof, skylight and forward hatch. The interior fit out is in Iroko
  and 12mm marine ply. Her masts are Corten ‘A’ galvanized steel, Gaffs, booms and
  bow sprit are all in galvanized steel. Irene has a 72 horsepower 4 cylinder CT
  Marine marinized Ford diesel (recently re-built by Mitchel Mechanical) with a
  Borg Warner Velvet Drive 2:1 reduction gear driving a 23” propellor. Irene has
  just been antifouled and is being presented at her best. The construction story
  of Irene is a testament of endurance by an owner who hand made all of the deck
  and rigging along with a crafted interior.
