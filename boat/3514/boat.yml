full_description: "Introducing a new dinghy from Andrew Wolstenholme, especially designed\
  \ for Young (and Old) Gaffers.  Key Points  Overall length of 13'6\" and beam of\
  \ 5'3\" (4.1 x 1.6m) \u2013 a comfortable size for building at home in the garage.\
  \ Easy to tow behind a small car and yet large enough for family sailing.  The single\
  \ chine hull form follows on from the popular dinghies of the 50s and 60s \u2013\
  \ Hornet, Graduate, Scorpion, GP14, etc. \u2013 but with a more classic appearance\
  \ and a sweeping sheer and raked transom.  Construction is a variation of stitch-and-tape,\
  \ using CNC-cut components.  With simplicity of build in mind, and also functionality,\
  \ she has a lowered deck in the same style as the Mirror Dinghy, which is useful\
  \ for lessening the risk of lines going overboard and providing more sprawling space\
  \ for children.  The versatile design allows for sailing, rowing, sculling or outboard\
  \ motor."
