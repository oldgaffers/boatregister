full_description: |-
  Introducing a new dinghy from Andrew Wolstenholme, especially designed for Young
  (and Old) Gaffers. Key Points Overall length of 13'6" and beam of 5'3" (4.1 x
  1.6m) – a comfortable size for building at home in the garage. Easy to tow
  behind a small car and yet large enough for family sailing. The single chine
  hull form follows on from the popular dinghies of the 50s and 60s – Hornet,
  Graduate, Scorpion, GP14, etc. – but with a more classic appearance and a
  sweeping sheer and raked transom. Construction is a variation of
  stitch-and-tape, using CNC-cut components. With simplicity of build in mind, and
  also functionality, she has a lowered deck in the same style as the Mirror
  Dinghy, which is useful for lessening the risk of lines going overboard and
  providing more sprawling space for children. The versatile design allows for
  sailing, rowing, sculling or outboard motor.
