short_description: <p>&#39;Periwinkle&#39; is a Tamarisk 24 designed by David Cannel
  and built by Glyn White of Fowey in 1983. Glyn was a former cabinet maker and thus
  not surprisingly she was finished&nbsp;to a high standard. The hull was made in
  GRP and the deck in marine ply, the rest in teak and iroko.</p>
full_description: '<p>Periwinkle''s design was based on an early 19th century fishing
  boat from the Itchen Ferry yards on the Hamble. She was rigged as a gaff cutter
  with a pole masted topsail.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>''Periwinkle'' was built by Glyn White of Fowey, &nbsp;was a former cabinet maker
  who built a number of Tamarisks at his yard in Fowey. One of his former workers
  recognised ''Periwinkle'' whilst recently moored in Fowey and told her owner about
  her origins and the small yard beside the water where she was built. &nbsp;The yard
  is no longer being now replaced by houses.</p>

  <p>She appears to have spent most of her time in the River Dart area being moored
  latterly in Dartmouth and is thought to have just been used for cruising along the
  South West coasts. &nbsp;But her full sailing history is not known.</p>'
