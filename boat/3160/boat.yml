full_description: "<p>The current owner reports that when he bought Tabnab, she had\
  \ been sitting in a boatyard neglected for about 12 years. Most of the cockpit had\
  \ been ripped out and she had about 6&#39;&#39; of water in her. It would have been\
  \ more but luckily a skin fitting had been removed which kept the level below the\
  \ engine (a Volvo MD5A).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the boat was sailing it became apparent\
  \ that her windward abilities were not of the best. John Banton decided to add 6&#39;&#39;\
  \ to her keel, this work was carried out in 2011, lots of work-never again, transforming\
  \ the boat so that she now points as well as other similar sized gaffers.</p>"
