  The current owner reports that when he bought Tabnab, she had been sitting in a
  boatyard neglected for about 12 years. Most of the cockpit had been ripped out
  and she had about 6'' of water in her. It would have been more but luckily a
  skin fitting had been removed which kept the level below the engine (a Volvo
  MD5A).


  Once the boat was sailing it became apparent that her windward abilities were
  not of the best. John Banton decided to add 6'' to her keel, this work was
  carried out in 2011, lots of work-never again, transforming the boat so that she
  now points as well as other similar sized gaffers.
