full_description: "<p>Designed on the lines lines of a Falmouth Quay punt by Harley\
  \ Maud, &#39;Wanda&#39; originally had no bowsprit and a small Bermudan mizzen.\
  \ In a Beken photo of 1937, she&#39;s looking quite an &#39;ugly duckling&#39;,\
  \ but in the ownership of BGC Scott, she raced with the Royal Ocean Racing Club,\
  \ having been rigged with a short bowsprit improving her appearance and speed. During\
  \ the 1930s the majority of RORC yachts were Bermudan and it seems that &#39;Wanda&#39;\
  \ and another gaff-rigged yacht, &#39;Griffin&#39; were used to develop the racing\
  \ rig for gaffers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s she had a doghouse fitted and Thornycroft\
  \ petrol engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OGA member Colin Ryan cruised &#39;Wanda&#39; on\
  \ the East Coast and in 2006 she raced in the centenary RORC Cowes - Dinard race\
  \ finishing 5th in her class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently she has been cruising\
  \ round Britain and spent two summers in the Western Isles off Scotland.</p>"

short_description: <p>&#39;Wanda&#39; is a Harley Mead design built in the 1930s,
  originally rigged as a gaff yawl. In 1938 her mizzen was removed and she was refitted
  as a stem head gaff sloop. She is a very fast boat, close winded and wherever she
  travels will inspire and impress.</p>
