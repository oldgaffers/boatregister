  is cutter rigged.
full_description: "<p>Hardy is a direct descendent of the Itchen fishing boats A.E\
  \ Payne&#39;s grandfather, Alfred Payne, designed and built with Dan Hatcher. Her\
  \ lines speak of a period reaching back to the very genesis of yacht racing, yet\
  \ retains a &#39;Cod&#39;s head and mackeral&#39;s tail&#39; hull shape, uninfluenced\
  \ by the metre rule. Hardy is on the National Historic Ships UK register.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>Hardy has been in the current owner&#39;s family since 1969, with restoration\
  \ starting in 1981. She sailed to Denmark in 1997 and is a regular sight in regattas\
  \ and other events around the East Coast and Solent.</p>"
