short_description: <p>Half Moon was built by her first owner over a period of five
  years.</p>
full_description: '<p>Built by first owner, Nigel Martin, from plans supplied by Laurent
  Giles, he has been very pleased with her. ''Half Moon'' was launched from the Royal
  Harwich Yacht Club''s slip, April 2011.</p>

  <p>She is not a fast boat, there again no slouch. Her shallow draft allows us to
  explore the creeks and rivers of our East Coast. She is very comfortable for several
  days at sea. &nbsp;Since launching the boat, I have increased the length of the
  bowsprit by about 60cms. &nbsp;The boat is much more balanced now. &nbsp;Last year
  I built a new hollow mast which has reduced weight aloft. She now sails really well</p>'
