short_description: '*Half Moon* was built by her first owner over a period of five
  years.'
full_description: |-
  Built by first owner, Nigel Martin, from plans supplied by Laurent Giles, he has
  been very pleased with her. *Half Moon* was launched from the Royal Harwich
  Yacht Club's slip, April 2011.


  She is not a fast boat, there again no slouch. Her shallow draft allows us to
  explore the creeks and rivers of our East Coast. She is very comfortable for
  several days at sea.  Since launching the boat, I have increased the length of
  the bowsprit by about 60 cms. The boat is much more balanced now.  Last year I
  built a new hollow mast which has reduced weight aloft. She now sails really
  well
