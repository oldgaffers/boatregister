  The Cumberland Sea Fisheries Patrol cutter *Solway*, now *Carlotta*, built in
  1899 has a fascinating history and has been sailing on the Pacific northwest of
  North America following an extensive refitin 2004. Following another major refit
  and new owner, Michael Field, she has returned to the Southampton area, UK,
  2017.  

  ***Carlotta*** **– Her story - June 2010 OGA Logbook**

  This year the venerable Bristol Channel pilot cutter *Carlotta* turns one
  hundred and eleven years old!  

  She’s been owned and sailed by pilots, princesses, lords, criminals, Churchill’s
  cousin, viscounts, an illegitimate line of the Royal family, and adventurous
  Canadians. Her history includes a daring World War II escape from Guernsey as
  the Germans were landing at the airport. She’s been laid over by hurricane force
  winds until the mast trucks were almost hitting the water. She’s raced
  successfully against Twelve-metres.  

  The British Army Training Manual was written on board. One time a porpoise swam
  across her foredeck in a Scottish gale! She’s been dropped four feet from a
  travel lift, towed by rowboat completely around Texada Island, made passages
  averaging 180-mile days, and been engineless for the past forty years.  

  In the 70’s she fell over on her beaching legs, smashing her port side frames
  in. That was almost the end of her, but in stepped Canadian Peter Heiberg. Peter
  bought *Carlotta* and began a four year rebuild at Thomas Ponsharden’s yard in
  Falmouth. Peter got her sailing again and set off for Vancouver BC, stopping in
  the Caribbean for a few years along the way to race in the classic boat circuit
  out of St.Barts.

  Eventually Peter brought *Carlotta* back to Vancouver, where he was the founding
  member of the Old Gaffer’s Association of BC. The BC chapter of the OGA
  frequently got together to race against each other, but somehow the organization
  dissolved. Now the chapter is back under full sail with a new revived interest
  spurred on by Mr. Colin Ming!

  In 2004 Heiberg sold *Carlotta* to Barbra and Stephen Mohan. Long time admirers
  of *Carlotta* and pilot cutters, the Mohans jumped at the chance to be
  *Carlotta’s* next custodians. After one year of sailing and living aboard on the
  Sunshine Coast of British Columbia attention was turned to long term maintenance
  and repair. The Mohan’s began the process of restoring *Carlotta* with an eye
  towards the original workboat she was in 1899. Now *Carlotta* is once again
  sailing after an extensive five year refit and is ready for many more years of
  fantastic adventures.

  In 2015 *Carlotta* was based at Powell River, British Columbia, and purchased by
  Michael Wright who lives in London. She underwent repairs and restoration work
  at the yard of Abernethy and Gaudin on Vancouver Island. In 2017, she was
  transported by road and by sea back to the UK after more than 43 years abroad to
  her new base on the River Hamble, near Southampton.
