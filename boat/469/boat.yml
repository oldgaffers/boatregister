  ### Carlotta, her story, by Stephen Mohan, British Colombia & Pacific NW Area


  #### First published in the Gaffers Log, June 2010


  The venerable Sea Fisheries patrol boat Carlotta, built in 1899, is still
  sailing! She’s been owned and sailed by the Cumberland Sea Fisheries committee,
  a ships' chandler princesses, lords, criminals, Churchill’s cousin, viscounts,
  an illegitimate line of the Royal family, and one-eyed Canadians.


  The Cumberland Committee held their AGM on 20^^th^^ April 1899, they resolved to
  order the patrol boat for the south of their district from W H Holford of
  Gloucester for £475 (£38,230).  She measured 49 foot 10 inch on deck,
  thirteen-foot beam and drew seven foot eight inches of water, and was named *The
  Solway*.  She was employed on patrol duties until 1907, with a crew of four. 
  Her master was Luke Woodhouse of High Street, Maryport.  The 1901 census
  described Luke Woodhouse as a thirty six year old ‘Sea Fisheries Boatman’.  From
  1903 her Master was John Edmondson Routledge, of 105 High Street, Maryport.  On
  the 20th of June 1907, the boat was transferred to ship chandler John Thomas Kee
  of 25 West Quay, Ramsey, Isle of Man. 


  Her history includes a daring World War II escape from Guernsey as the Germans
  were landing at the airport. She’s been laid over by hurricane force winds until
  the mast trucks were almost hitting the water. She’s raced successfully against
  12-metres. The British Army Training Manual was written on board. One time a
  porpoise swam across her foredeck in a Scottish gale! She’s been dropped four
  feet from a travel lift, towed by rowboat completely around Texada Island, made
  passages averaging 180-mile days, and been engineless for the past 40 years.


  In the 1970s she fell over on her beaching legs, smashing her port side frames
  in. That was almost the end of her, but in stepped Canadian Peter Heiberg. Peter
  bought Carlotta and began a four year rebuild at Thomas Ponsharden’s yard in
  Falmouth. Peter got her sailing again and set off for Vancouver BC, stopping in
  the Caribbean for a few years along the way to race in the classic boat circuit
  out of St.Barts.


  Eventually Peter brought Carlotta back to Vancouver, where he was the founding
  member of the Old Gaffer’s Association of BC. The BC chapter of the OGA
  frequently got together to race against each other, but somehow the organization
  dissolved. Now it is back under full sail with a new revived interest spurred on
  by Mr. Colin Ming.


  In 2004 Heiberg sold Carlotta to Barbara and Stephen Mohan. Long time admirers
  of Carlotta and pilot cutters, the Mohans jumped at the chance to be Carlotta’s
  next custodians. After one year of sailing and living aboard on the Sunshine
  Coast of British Columbia attention was turned to long term maintenance and
  repair. The Mohan’s began the process of restoring Carlotta with an eye towards
  the original workboat she was in 1899.  It should be noted that Carlotta did not
  work as a pilot cutter in her career.  She was adopted by the Bristol Channel
  Pilot Cutters Owners Association as she is the only extant example of a cutter
  built by W H Holford who had built a couple of Pilot cutters.


  In 2015 Carlotta was based at Powell River, British Columbia, and purchased by
  Michael Wright who lives in London. She underwent repairs and restoration work
  at the yard of Abernethy and Gaudin on Vancouver Island. In 2017, she was
  transported by road and by sea back to the UK after more than 43 years abroad to
  her new base on the River Hamble, near Southampton.
