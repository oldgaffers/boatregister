short_description: Kate is a Memory 19, a shoal draft, gaff rigged cutter, designed
  by Tony Robinson RINA. She is based on the design of Brightlingsea working craft
  around the 1920s.
full_description: "<p>Professionally built by the Liverpool Boat Co. in 1979, Kate\
  \ is the two berth, cabin version of the Memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was cruised around\
  \ Hayling Island by David Northcott in the 1980s, then moved to the English north-east\
  \ coast by Haydn Windle who explored much of the Baltic Coast and Gota Canal from\
  \ Stockholm in the 1990s. Since 2000, she has been sailed around the Essex Blackwater\
  \ from Lawling Creek by Keith Davidson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her decks were extensively\
  \ strengthened early in the 1980s with extra knees and beams glassed in, making\
  \ her very sturdy. There is evidence that she may have had an inboard engine at\
  \ one time. Keith decided to install an outboard well, designed by Greg Dalrymple\
  \ at Salterns, and fitted it into the stern deck in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has\
  \ most controls leading back to the cockpit for single-handed use and has a choice\
  \ of small Cornish or jackyard topsails.</p>"
