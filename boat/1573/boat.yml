full_description: "Had been suggested that this was a shrimper, hull form negates\
  \ this view, similarly was said to be 2 or 3 foot longer on deck, if she is sawn\
  \ off, it is a very professionla cut. \"Thursday 31st August 1995. - The morning\
  \ was wet and miserable. I took the Dinghy to the long floating causeway at the\
  \ foot of the boatyard. I wanted to look in the shed at the top of the slip-way\
  \ because I was told that my first boat \u2018Mary of Chester\u2019 was under re-fit\
  \ there. After a while the rain stopped and I went to see Mary. Certainly she was\
  \ there, with transom removed as the current owner was planning build a counter\
  \ stern (something she had managed to do without in all her 105 years!).(John Langrick)\""
