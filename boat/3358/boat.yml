full_description: "<p>&#39;Cyrus&#39; was bought in 1998 as a decked hull for a home\
  \ completion project, replacing her owner&#39;s previous boat, a Hunter Channel\
  \ 32. Apart from the hull and deck all other parts of the boat have been out-sourced\
  \ or home manufactured prior to being fitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spars were completed\
  \ from smallish lengths of Douglas Fir. These lengths were then extended to the\
  \ required length using a home-made scarf engine to produce very efficient joints.\
  \ The mast is hollow to allow for electric service cables to be carried to the top.\
  \ The mast is held by a tabernacle and is capable of being lowered and raised by\
  \ a septuagenarian crew. The bowsprit can be raised so as to reduce overall length\
  \ and thus minimise mooring fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internally the bulkheads etc. have\
  \ been completed using tongue and groove teak battens. Likewise the rubbing strakes\
  \ are of teak. The length required was obtained by scarf jointing &quot;2x1&quot;\
  \ battens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine is a Beta diesel of 14 h.p., driving a fixed\
  \ three bladed propeller. When called on this has proved to be more than capable\
  \ of moving the boat against the tides experienced on the river Mersey.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>The boat is cutter rigged. The sails were made by Goacher sails of Windermere.\
  \ They comprise a mainsail, a staysail and a jib. Originally the foresails were\
  \ piston hanked to forestays.&nbsp;This arrangement was changed to a furling system\
  \ using Barton furling gear.&nbsp;In the interests of safety this has minimised\
  \ the necessity of the crew visiting the forepeak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every effort has\
  \ been used to take advantage of technological improvements, particularly in the\
  \ use of electronics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first the boat was sailed from Liverpool\
  \ Marina; its main activities being competing in the Venture series of races run\
  \ under the burgee of Liverpool&nbsp;Yacht Club. In these she achieved some success\
  \ being the victor in more than one series competing against a variety of yachts\
  \ of a more modern and conventional style</p>"
