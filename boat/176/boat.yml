  Brightlingsea oyster dredging, stowboating and inshore trawling.
full_description: |-
  Built for George Stoker of Mersea in 1896, by Aldous & Sons, the Essex oyster
  smack was named for George and his wife Alice. From 1896 to 1939 she was a
  commercial oyster dredger, stowboating and inshore trawling under sail from
  Brightlinsea. She was rebuilt in 1953 and recorded as still fishing until 1967.
  She had another major refit in 2002.


  After the second world war she was sold to Malcolm Macgregor and then in 1991 to
  Colin Shepheard who took her to his workshop in South Devon and fully restored
  her to her original build. In 1996 she returned to her home port of
  Brightlingsea and was bought by the Winters family, remaining the only fully
  rebuilt Brightlingsea fishing smack.
