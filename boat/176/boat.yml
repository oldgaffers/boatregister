full_description: "<p>Built for George Stoker of Mersea in 1896, by Aldous &amp; Sons,\
  \ the Essex oyster smack was named for George and his wife Alice. From 1896 to 1939\
  \ she was a commercial oyster dredger, stowboating and inshore trawling under sail\
  \ from Brightlinsea. She was rebuilt in 1953 and recorded as still fishing until\
  \ 1967. She had another major refit in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the second world\
  \ war she was sold to Malcolm Macgregor and then in 1991 to Colin Shepheard who\
  \ took her to his workshop in South Devon and fully restored her to her original\
  \ build. In 1996 she returned to her home port of Brightlingsea and was bought by\
  \ the Winters family, remaining the only fully rebuilt Brightlingsea fishing smack.</p>"
