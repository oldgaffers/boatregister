  sometime after August 1980: <p> Reputedly designed by Morgan Giles for a retired
  army officer. <p> Her swan stern is typical of this period and is of great advantage
  in a following sea provided the stern has not been us ed to carry heavy stores.
  <p>Her almost brand new diesel engine drives her at 6 knots and consumes approximately
  one gallon per hour. <p>The owner has crossed the channel very comfortably in heavy
  weather using jib, staysail and mizen while stowing the m ainsail. <p>'
