  *Chance* is a one off design by John Bain for her first owner and there are no
  other James Silver "Western Isles built. Chance is a change from other James
  Silver designs in that she is a true motorsailer, not a motor boat with
  steadying sails.

  *Chance* was built in 1948 by James Silver at Rosneath Boatyard, Argyll & Bute.
  Scotland for Lovat Crosley, who was a tenor chorister with D'Oyly Carte
  Repertory Opera Company from some point in 1914 until February 1916, and again
  for the July 1916-June 1917 season.She was designed by John Bain, his first true
  Motor Sailor design for James Silver. The design was called Western Isles –
  *Chance* was one of two vessels of this design. The whereabouts of the other
  Western Isles is unknown at present, although research is ongoing to track it
  down if the vessel still exists to this day.


  Between 1950- 1955, her name changed to *Token* when she was owned by Captain
  (S) S.J. Read mm, CBE, R.D, R.N.R port of Southampton. She was then bought by
  Edward Donald Boxall and Edward William Boxall from Hercules Engineering Co.
  Ltd.  Later from the early 70's *Chance* was moored at Moody's Boatyard on River
  Hamble for use as liveaboard


  In 2006, she was dry docked for work to be carried out including replacement of
  some planking.  Mr P Beckett  became owner of *Chance* (then *Token*) as payment
  of  a bad debit of previous owner. In 2020, she was offered for disposal, free
  to good home for restoration. Mr Simon Snowdon became owner from 2020 until June
  2021 where she was bought by her current owners. 


  Restoration of *Chance* begins at Woodplumpton by the Papendick Family. In
  October 2022, *Chance* moved to a new home at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, to
  continue restoration.
