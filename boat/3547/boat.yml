  *Chance* is a one off design by John Bain for her first owner and there are no
  other James Silver "Western Isles built. Chance is a change from other James
  Silver designs in that she is a true motorsailer, not a motor boat with
  steadying sails.

full_description: "*Chance* was built in 1948 by James Silver at Rosneath Boatyard,\
  \ Argyll & Bute.\nScotland for Lovat Crosley, who was a tenor chorister with D'Oyly\
  \ Carte\nRepertory Opera Company from some point in 1914 until February 1916, and\
  \ again\nfor the July 1916-June 1917 season.She was designed by John Bain, his first\
  \ true\nMotor Sailor design for James Silver. The design was called Western Isles\
  \ \u2013\n*Chance* was one of two vessels of this design. The whereabouts of the\
  \ other\nWestern Isles is unknown at present, although research is ongoing to track\
  \ it\ndown if the vessel still exists to this day.\n\n\nBetween 1950- 1955, her\
  \ name changed to *Token* when she was owned by Captain\n(S) S.J. Read mm, CBE,\
  \ R.D, R.N.R port of Southampton. She was then bought by\nEdward Donald Boxall and\
  \ Edward William Boxall from Hercules Engineering Co.\nLtd.\_ Later from the early\
  \ 70's *Chance* was moored at Moody's Boatyard on River\nHamble for use as liveaboard\n\
  \n\nIn 2006, she was dry docked for work to be carried out including replacement\
  \ of\nsome planking. \_Mr P Beckett \_became owner of *Chance* (then *Token*) as\
  \ payment\nof\_ a bad debit of previous owner. In 2020, she was offered for disposal,\
