short_description: '*Ariel* is a Heard Tosher, she won the Solent Gaffers Annual Race
  in 1990.'
full_description: "In 2016, her owner asserted that Ariel&#39;s sole purpose was\n
  for family fun and adventure, a role that a Tosher is ideally suited for. When\n
  purchased in 2013, the boat needed a refit. In summary, the refit included:\n \n
  Floor Boards and Cockpit Sole\n \n Sheer Capping and Rubbing Stake\n \n Keel Band\n
  \n Undiscovered stuff\n \n Back in the water after the refit, her owner asserts,
  &quot;The boat is so well behaved that we take long\n trips with a young family
  and &#39;Ariel&#39; takes good care of us. Ariel is\n a joy to sail with the family
  or single handed, she will be sorely missed. The\n large open spacious cockpit is
  ideal for fun trips with the kids and their pals.\n I have enjoyed Ariel and her
  stability so much that the next project will I hope\n also be a Heard built boat,
  ideally Heard 23.&quot;\n \n *Ariel* won the Solent OGA Annual Race in 1990 and
  her class the previous year.\n \n In 1991, when advertised for sale in Gaffers Log,
  the owner stated: &quot;This\n boat may be plastic but with over a ton of ballast
  she sails and behaves like\n the real thing. She carries over 300 sq. ft. of sail
  and is a very exciting little\n boat.&quot; At this time she was lying Bosham and
  the asking price was &pound;2,250.\n \n *Ariel* changed hands in 2018, and was brought
  back to the Solent\n from Ireland. To reflect this, her name was changed from *Ariel
  of Greystones*\n to *Arielle of Keyhaven*"

  sales_text: "Ariel is a Heard 18.5 Tosher. She served her role to introduce the\n
    younger members of the family to the joys of sailing just for fun. Perhaps she\n
    served her role too well as I have now lost my crew to dinghy sailing. While\n
    the crew hone their sailing skills in dinghy sailing, I will allow Ariel to\n
    fulfil her role for another family, while I seek a new project.\n\nAriel underwent
    a refit\n<a href=\"https://arielgreystones.com/refit-of-ariel/\" target=\"_PARENT\"\
    >as outlined on her website</a>\nand subsequent posts.\n\nAriel is a joy to sail
    with the family or single handed, she will be sorely missed. The\nlarge open spacious
    cockpit is ideal for fun trips with the kids and their pals.\nI have enjoyed Ariel
    and her stability so much that the next project will I\nhope also be a Heard built
    boat, ideally Heard 23.\n\nAriel has a racing rig with 3 head sail sizes [Storm,
    Working and Racing].\nAs Ariel is an open boat an automatic bilge pump was fitted
    with 12 V battery in the bilge.\nThe 12 V battery allowed for a VHF and navigation
    lights.\n\nAriel currently lies on a custom built 4 wheel trailer under cover
    of a PVC\ntarpaulin in Greystones Co. Wicklow, Ireland.\n \nThe trailer is braked
    and un-sprung. I tow the boat and trailer using a 1.9 diesel\nVW Passat without
    any difficulty. Should Ariel find a new home in the\n UK or further afield I am
    happy to assist with the ferry crossing. I would\n tow the boat to the ferry and
    travel with the boat to the UK based ferry port\n [Hollyhead, Liverpool, Pembroke
    or Fishguard] for a hand over to the new custodian.\n \n An option to keep the
    towing weight to a minimum would be to ship the Pig Iron\n ballast, warps rigging
    anchor etc. via a courier as a pelleted shipment. This\n would reduce the towing
    weight by over 800 Kg making the towing will within\n the limits of a family car.\n
    \n If a prospective custodian wishes to view the boat I am more than happy to
    pick them up at the airport and drop\n them back after the viewing. I live circa
    40 minutes from the airport.\n \n Storm, Working and racing Jib and Staysail are
    all if\n good working order\n \n - Topsail in good working order\n - Standing
    rigging was replaced with new SS in 2015\n - Running rigging all in good working
    order\n - Anchor with 6M of chain and 10M anchor line\n - 4 fenders with 2 mooring
    lines\n - Automatic bilge pump with 12 V battery\n - Custom built 4 wheel trailer\n
    - PVC tarpaulin with Boom Cover\n - beaching legs\n - Oars and Oar locks"

  sales_text: "An attractive example of this iconic Falmouth working boat and trailer
    sailer.   Comes with road trailer.  Arielle is in very good order having been
    loved and carefully maintained by its current and previous owners as a cutter
    rigged sailing boat.  She is an excellent day boat being equally manageable single
    handed or as a 'day out' family boat and has proved herself a safe and deft performer
    under sail in all the various seas the Solent has thrown at her.  Outboard available
    by separate negotiation. Located in Lymington, Hampshire "
