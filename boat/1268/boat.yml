  *Ariel* is a Heard Tosher, she won the Solent Gaffers Annual Race in 1990.
full_description: |-
  In 2016, her owner asserted that Ariel&#39;s sole purpose was
   for family fun and adventure, a role that a Tosher is ideally suited for. When
   purchased in 2013, the boat needed a refit. In summary, the refit included:
   
   Floor Boards and Cockpit Sole
   
   Sheer Capping and Rubbing Stake
   
   Keel Band
   
   Undiscovered stuff
   
   Back in the water after the refit, her owner asserts, &quot;The boat is so well behaved that we take long
   trips with a young family and &#39;Ariel&#39; takes good care of us. Ariel is
   a joy to sail with the family or single handed, she will be sorely missed. The
   large open spacious cockpit is ideal for fun trips with the kids and their pals.
   I have enjoyed Ariel and her stability so much that the next project will I hope
   also be a Heard built boat, ideally Heard 23.&quot;
   
   *Ariel* won the Solent OGA Annual Race in 1990 and her class the previous year.
   
   In 1991, when advertised for sale in Gaffers Log, the owner stated: &quot;This
   boat may be plastic but with over a ton of ballast she sails and behaves like
   the real thing. She carries over 300 sq. ft. of sail and is a very exciting little
   boat.&quot; At this time she was lying Bosham and the asking price was &pound;2,250.
   
   *Ariel* changed hands in 2018, and was brought back to the Solent
   from Ireland. To reflect this, her name was changed from *Ariel of Greystones*
   to *Arielle of Keyhaven*

    Ariel is a Heard 18.5 Tosher. She served her role to introduce the
    younger members of the family to the joys of sailing just for fun. Perhaps she
    served her role too well as I have now lost my crew to dinghy sailing. While
    the crew hone their sailing skills in dinghy sailing, I will allow Ariel to
    fulfil her role for another family, while I seek a new project.
    
    Ariel underwent a refit
    <a href="https://arielgreystones.com/refit-of-ariel/" target="_PARENT">as outlined on her website</a>
    and subsequent posts.
    
    Ariel is a joy to sail with the family or single handed, she will be sorely missed. The
    large open spacious cockpit is ideal for fun trips with the kids and their pals.
    I have enjoyed Ariel and her stability so much that the next project will I
    hope also be a Heard built boat, ideally Heard 23.
    
    Ariel has a racing rig with 3 head sail sizes [Storm, Working and Racing].
    As Ariel is an open boat an automatic bilge pump was fitted with 12 V battery in the bilge.
    The 12 V battery allowed for a VHF and navigation lights.
    
    Ariel currently lies on a custom built 4 wheel trailer under cover of a PVC
    tarpaulin in Greystones Co. Wicklow, Ireland.
     
    The trailer is braked and un-sprung. I tow the boat and trailer using a 1.9 diesel
    VW Passat without any difficulty. Should Ariel find a new home in the
     UK or further afield I am happy to assist with the ferry crossing. I would
     tow the boat to the ferry and travel with the boat to the UK based ferry port
     [Hollyhead, Liverpool, Pembroke or Fishguard] for a hand over to the new custodian.
     
     An option to keep the towing weight to a minimum would be to ship the Pig Iron
     ballast, warps rigging anchor etc. via a courier as a pelleted shipment. This
     would reduce the towing weight by over 800 Kg making the towing will within
     the limits of a family car.
     
     If a prospective custodian wishes to view the boat I am more than happy to pick them up at the airport and drop
     them back after the viewing. I live circa 40 minutes from the airport.
