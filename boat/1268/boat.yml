full_description: "<p>In 2016, her owner asserted that Ariel&#39;s sole purpose was\
  \ for family fun and adventure, a role that a Tosher is ideally suited for. When\
  \ purchased in 2013, the boat needed a refit. In summary, the refit included:<br\
  \ />\r\nFloor Boards and Cockpit Sole<br />\r\nSheer Capping and Rubbing Stake<br\
  \ />\r\nKeel Band<br />\r\nUndiscovered stuff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the water after\
  \ the refit, her owner asserts, &quot;The boat is so well behaved that we take long\
  \ trips with a young family and &#39;Ariel&#39; takes good care of us. Ariel is\
  \ a joy to sail with the family or single handed, she will be sorely missed. The\
  \ large open spacious cockpit is ideal for fun trips with the kids and their pals.\
  \ I have enjoyed Ariel and her stability so much that the next project will I hope\
  \ also be a Heard built boat, ideally Heard 23.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Ariel&#39;\
  \ won the Solent OGA Annual Race in 1990 and her class the previous year.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>In 1991, when advertised for sale in Gaffers Log, the owner stated: &quot;This\
  \ boat may be plastic but with over a ton of ballast she sails and behaves like\
  \ the real thing. She carries over 300 sq. ft. of sail and is a very exciting little\
  \ boat.&quot; At this time she was lying Bosham and the asking price was &pound;2,250.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>&#39;Ariel&#39; changed hands in 2018, and was brought back to the Solent\
  \ from Ireland. To reflect this, her name was changed from &#39;Ariel of Greystones&#39;\
  \ to &#39;Arielle of Keyhaven&#39;.</p>"
