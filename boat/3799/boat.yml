  Speranza was built in 1902 by Liver and Wilding and is the first boat to appear
  on Lloyds Register as a Liver and Wilding built boat after their purchase of the
  J Gibson and Sons yard in Fleetwood. Beginning with Rev J. P. Way, DD,
  headmaster of the Rossal School, Speranza changed hands frequently, until
  arriving in Lymingtom in 1939. In mid June 1945, she was moored in the upper
  Thames when she was purchased for £800 by Hans De Meiss-Teuffen, a double agent
  in the early days of the war. As a Swiss national, he was able to obtain a
  sailing permit the day after VJ day, and Speranza was the first yacht to leave
  England after the war. After a sailing to Casablanca by way of Portugual and
  Gibraltar, Speranza left for New London Connecticut, setting a record at the
  time for fastest northern route crossing solo, at 58 days. She was on display at
  the Mystic Seaport Museum for several years after her arrival, and has remained
  in the area since. She is currently undergoing restoration
