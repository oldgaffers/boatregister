short_description: Built by Crossfields, Arnside, in 1903 <i>Ziska</i> is now based
  on the west coast of America. In 2019 she took part in the Race to Alaska. Ashley
  Butler, one of the country&#39;s leading wooden boatbuilders sailed her across the
  Atlantic in 1999.
full_description: "<p><em>Ziska</em> was launched at Arnside on 28th January 1903,\
  \ eleven months before the first aircraft flight in December. She was built as a\
  \ yacht for John Aspden of Lytham. <em>Ziska</em> spent her early life in the Irish\
  \ Sea, before moving to Whitby after the Second World War.</p>\n<p><em>Ziska</em>\
  \ was built by Crossfield Brothers on Church Hill in Arnside. The lead partner in\
  \ 1903 was John Crossfield, who moved to Conway in 1906 to set up a boat building\
  \ business there. John built <em>Pacific Moon </em>(originally <em>Nama</em>) in\
  \ Conway in 1913. <em>Pacific Moon</em> was sailed to Tahiti by Sidney Howard in\
  \ 1931/2 featuring in his book \u201CThames to Tahiti\u201D.</p>\n<p>In 1997 after\
  \ a long period of neglect <em>Ziska</em> was discovered in Cowes and restored by\
  \ Ashley Butler, a 19 year old boat builder. In 1999 he sailed her across the Atlantic,\
  \ spending four years cruising and racing her in the West Indies., before selling\
  \ her in 2003. During his ownership she was chartered to the explorer Tim Severin\
  \ who was making a film about different inspirations for Robinson Crusoe.</p>\n\
  <p><em>Ziksa</em> was shipped across America by road in 2006 to Port Townsend, Washington\
  \ State on the West Coast. Port Townsend is a centre for wooden boat building with\
  \ a college and festival.</p>\n<p>She was purchased by Stanford Siver in 2017 who\
  \ spent the next two years restoring her helped by a team of shipwrights. In 2019\
  \ <em>Ziska</em> took part in the 750 mile long Race2Alaska, which is designed to\
  \ show case the latest in human and wind powered boat technology, coming 22nd of\
  \ 35th starter. In 2020 she was shortlisted for the best Classic Boat Restoration\
  \ under 40 foot and the Gstaad Yacht Club Centenarian of the Year.</p>\n<p>The Name\
  \ Ziska is short for the German girl\u2019s name Franziska and similar to the Yiddish\
  \ girl\u2019s name Ziske meaning \u201CLittle Sweet One\u201D. One eyed General\
  \ Jan Ziska (1360-1424) is a Czech national hero. However it is probable that <em>Ziska</em>\
  \ was named after \u201C Princess Ziska \u201C a novel published in 1897 by Victorian\
  \ best-selling author Marie Corelli set in Egypt. The final melodramatic scene takes\
  \ place in the inner chamber of the Great Pyramid.</p>\n<p>There were at least two\
  \ other yachts called <em>Ziska</em> built around 1900. <em>Ziska</em> (1898) was\
  \ a Dublin Bay 25 footer, which was later raced at Royal Cork. <em>Ziska</em> (1904)\
  \ was a Royal Windermere 17 footer. Ziska Pilsner made by the Bowness Bay Brewing\
  \ Company is named after the Royal Windermere yacht.</p>\n<p>In 1901 the &nbsp;Lancashire\
  \ Sea Fisheries Committee brought a steam yacht <em>Ziska</em>, which was built\
  \ in 1899. They renamed &nbsp;the boat <em>John Fell</em>. John Aspden, Ziska's\
  \ first owner was a Fisheries Bailiff in 1901 so would have been aware of the vessel.\
  \ Perhaps he named &nbsp;his boat after the steam yacht.</p>\n<p><strong>History\
  \ by Year</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1903</strong> Built by Crossfield Brothers in\
  \ the Top Shop on Church Hill in Arnside for John W.Aspden of Lytham</p>\n<p>John\
  \ Aspden (1855 -1921) was born in Blackburn, an inland mill town. In 1891 census\
  \ he lived in Fleetwood working as a fisherman. By 1901 Census he was a Sea Fisheries\
  \ Bailiff living in Lytham. In 1904 he was the General Manger of Lytham Baths, a\
  \ Victorian leisure complex fed by sea water. The adjacent Assembly Rooms housed\
  \ the yacht club.</p>\n<p><strong>1904 </strong>Recorded in Lloyds Register as owned\
  \ by Arthur Earle-Hunt of Temissary Lodge, Do</p>\n<p>Arthur Earle-Hunt (1860 \u2013\
  \ 1928) was born Arthur Hunt in Dublin. In the 1881 Census he was recorded as a\
  \ bank clerk. His maternal grandfather was Thomas Earle, a Manchester solicitor.</p>\n\
  <p>His first wife Evelyn eloped with her employer James Cooper a Manchester businessman\
  \ living in secret with him for 7 years. Arthur received \xA3800 damages against\
  \ Cooper (about \xA3100,000 in today\u2019s money) when his divorce was granted\
  \ in 1894. James Cooper was tried for murdering his second wife a barmaid in Douglas,\
  \ Isle of Man in 1892 receiving the lenient sentence of 10 years penal servitude\
  \ for man slaughter, when the usual punishment for murder would have been hanging.\
  \ Both the murder trial and divorce were reported in the national press.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ 1894 he married Ellen Stopford of Tremissary Lodge, Douglas Isle of Man, the wealthy\
  \ widow of a Manchester brewer, 9 years his senior. It is probable that the money\
  \ to buy <em>Ziska</em> came from her.</p>\n<p>Arthur joined the Royal Mersey Yacht\
  \ Club.</p>\n<p>June 1904 Arthur sold <em>Ziska</em> to John Evarard, a Douglas\
  \ entrepreneur involved with various leisure businesses including Mona Steam Ship\
  \ Company that offered trips round the bay.</p>\n<p><strong>1905</strong> April:\
  \ John Evarard sold <em>Ziska</em> back to Arthur Earle-Hunt</p>\n<p>August: Arthur\
  \ Earle-Hunt sells <em>Ziska</em> to W.J.Ellis, a Dublin solicitor. <em>Ziska</em>\
  \ kept at Kingstown (Dun Laogharie), Ireland\u2019s leading yachting centre with\
  \ three Royal Clubs</p>\n<p><strong>1908</strong> Lloyds Register records <em>Ziska</em>\
  \ as being owned by Arthur Holt and partners. In September 1907 the Owner of Ziska\
  \ was reprimanded by Royal Mersey Yacht Club for flying a club burgee when he was\
  \ not aboard the yacht. Therefore, Arthur Holt and partners must have acquired <em>Ziska</em>\
  \ in 1906</p>\n<p>Arthur Holt (1876 \u2013 1941) was a Liverpool architect. He was\
  \ a member of Hoylake Sailing Club and the Royal Mersey. At first, he owned <em>Ziska</em>\
  \ in partnership with others, then outright from 1925. When he first involved with\
  \ <em>Ziska</em>, he was only 30 living in a terraced house in Hoylake. By time\
  \ he sold her in 1935 he was Vice Commodore of the North Wales Cruising Club, living\
  \ in a large detached house in West Kirby, and could afford to replace her with\
  \ <em>Halcyone</em> a brand new 30 ton yacht.</p>\n<p>June 1908 \u2013 2nd in Royal\

  \ In November Ashley Butler, a 19 year old shipwright called in at Cowes in his\
  \ 23 foot gaff rigged yacht. He came across <em>Ziska</em> lying on a wharf under\
  \ a torn covers with a For Sale sign held on by a rusty nail. Ashley was looking\
  \ for a larger classic boat which he could take to the West Indies. Next morning\
  \ by chance he met the owner and exchanged his yacht for <em>Ziska</em>.</p>\n<p>Taking\
  \ out a bank loan to transport her back to Essex, Ashley spent the next two years\
  \ restoring <em>Ziska</em> whilst living aboard her, working on her in the evening\
  \ after finishing his day job working as the foreman at Arthur Holt\u2019s boat\
  \ yard at Heybridge. (no relation to Arthur Holt who owned <em>Ziska</em> from 1908\
  \ to 1934). Following Ashley\u2019s restoration <em>Ziska</em> did not have an engine.</p>\n\
  <p><strong>1998</strong> <em>Ziska</em> takes part in the Solent Old Gaffers Race\
  \ at Cowes, along with <em>Bonita</em> (188) <em>Maryll</em> (1937), two other Crossfield\
  \ boats. <em>Maryll</em> skippered by Jon Wainwright beats <em>Ziska</em> and <em>Bonita</em>.\
  \ The race is recounted by Jon Wainwright in his book \u201COnly Some Many Tides\u201D\
  \ about <em>Deva</em>, a Royal Mersey Rivers Class Yacht built by Crossfields in\
  \ 1912.</p>\n<p><strong>1999</strong> Ashley, aged 21, takes her across the Atlantic\
  \ and spends the next 4 years racing and cruising her in West Indies. Crossing the\
  \ Atlantic he averages 140 miles a day. He sails her double handed across the Altantic\
  \ and then single handed in the West Indies.</p>\n<p><strong>2000</strong> Chartered\
  \ by the explorer Tim Severin who was researching different inspirations for Robinson\
  \ Crusoe, including Henry Pitman a surgeon in the Duke of Monmouth\u2019s army who\
  \ was sentenced to ten years slave labour in the West Indies by Judge Jeffries.\
  \ Henry Pitman escaping from captivity in Barbados was left marooned along with\
  \ 11 companions by pirates on the uninhabited Isla La Tortuga (Island of Turtles)\
  \ off the Venezuelan coast.</p>\n<p><em>Ziska\u2019s</em> voyage is eloquently recorded\
  \ by Tim Severin in his book \u201CIn Search of Robinson Crusoe\u201D. There is\
  \ a DVD of the book. Tim describes raising the mainsail as follows \u201CThere was\
  \ the piercing high pitched squeak of the wooden jaws of the gaff sliding ponderously\
  \ up the mast, followed by the erratic flap and clatter of heavy canvas. ..... When\
  \ the sheets were hauled in and the mainsail exerted pressure, <em>Ziska</em> groaned\
  \ with the effort, then groaned again.\u201D</p>\n<p>With Tim Severin and Ashley\
  \ on <em>Ziska</em> was Trondur Patursson, a Faroese artist, who had crossed the\
  \ Atlantic in 1976 with Tim in a currach to prove that it was possible for St Brendan\
  \ to have discovered America from Ireland in the sixth century AD</p>\n<p><strong>2003</strong>\
  \ Takes part in Antigua Classics on her hundredth birthday winning multiple races.</p>\n\
  <p>Sold to an American who wanted to use her for long distance cruising. Unfortunately,\
  \ his job meant he did not have time to sail her. <em>Ziska</em> is kept at Annapolis\
  \ on Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, his job meant he did not have time to sail her.\
  \ Ashley now runs Butler &amp; Co one of the country\u2019s leading wooden boat\
  \ builders at Penpol Creek, near Falmouth</p>\n<p><strong>2005</strong> Sold to\
  \ tall ship sailor and shipwright, Clint Thompson who moves her to Port Townsend,\
  \ Washington State on West Coast of America by truck. Clint and his young family\
  \ live aboard <em>Ziska</em> for 6 years, cruising locally. Clint is a friend of\
  \ Ashley Butler.</p>\n<p>Port Townsend is a centre for boating and maritime life\
  \ with a skilled workforce. There is a wooden boat building college nearby. Events\
  \ include an annual wooden boat festival. Port Townsend grew up as a Victorian port\
  \ that went into decline as the railway never reached</p>\n<p><strong>2013</strong>\
  \ Clint sells <em>Ziska</em> as she is too small for his family. Brought by another\
  \ Port Townsend Owner</p>\n<p><strong>2017</strong> Bought by Stanford Siver of\
  \ Port Townsend. Stanford\u2019s involvement with boats started when he left his\
  \ job on the East Coast of USA and enrolled in the North West Academy of Wooden\
  \ Boatbuilding, near Port Townsend. With the help of a team of local shipwrights,\
  \ Stanford spent two years restoring <em>Ziska</em>, before entering her to the\
  \ Race2Alaska. Work included an upgraded salon, a new mast, rigging and sails.</p>\n\
  <p><strong>2019</strong> Takes part in the Race2Alaska from Port Townsend to Ketchikan\
  \ in Alaska up the Canadian Coast in June. The Race is designed to showcase the\
  \ latest in sail and wind powered technology. <em>Ziska</em> is by far the oldest\
  \ and heaviest boat to take part. She completes the race in 16 days, 12 days behind\
  \ the winning boat coming 22nd out of 35 starters (only 25 finished). To complete\
  \ the 750-mile distance, <em>Ziska</em> had to sail 1282 miles having to tack against\
  \ north westerly winds. When the wind dropped the crew had to row her 12 tonnes.\
  \ The general conclusion was that <em>Ziska</em> performed well in strong winds,\
  \ but less well in light winds having to be rowed at times.</p>\n<p><strong>2020</strong>\
