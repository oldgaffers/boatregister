    Penne has been used mostly in the Lake District, Norfolk Broads, and
    currently at Walton on the Naze. She has:
    - a new canopy and backdrop (2023)
    - an SBS Eurospec trailer (2019) and a new jib in 2020.
    - a 6 HP Yamaha outboard (2017) with remote fuel tank
    - new running rigging in 2021.
    - Anchor and chain new in 2022, and a spinnaker/Iso in 'as new' condition.

    2-berth with cushions, and loads of storage space. She is a delight to sail.
