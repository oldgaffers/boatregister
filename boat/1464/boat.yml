  ALBERT STRANGE DESIGN NO. 144

full_description: "*Nirvana*'s design, predating her build by 10 years, was commissioned\
  \ by London\nnaval architect and ship owner/ broker Noël Constant. But there was\
  \ a war on.\nConstant survived it, Albert Strange died naturally in 1917, and No.\
  \ 144 - his\nlargest canoe yawl design - remained unbuilt.   \n\nEnter Howth, County\
  \ Dublin dental surgeon A.W. 'Billy' Mooney, a very active\nmember of Howth Yacht\
  \ Club and avid sailor, until recently owner of the Howth 17\nClass day racing cutter\
  \ *Rita*, and desirous of extending the sailing horizons\nafforded by his converted\
  \ RNLI lifeboat cruising ketch LIL.      Perhaps also in\ncelebration, or at least\
  \ a refection of stability in Ireland following its\nturbulent early 20th Century\
  \ years of the First World War, the War of\nIndependence, and the Civil War, Mooney\
  \ purchased the No. 144 drawings from\nStrange's widow, Julia, and Jack Tyrrell\
  \ gave them form that winter at his\nfamily's industrious boatyard on the bank of\
  \ the River Avoca, Arklow, County\nWicklow.       Tyrrell was only turning 20, and\
  \ *Nirvana* (as she would be\nlaunched) may have been the first Tyrrell yard build\
  \ in his command, yet he was\nalready highly experienced in the building and operation\
  \ of the sailing coasters\nhis family owned. 35-year-old Mooney was also experienced\
  \ as a racer and cruiser\nof small yachts. He is believed to have been deeply involved\
  \ in the\nspecification and build.      Mooney cruised *Nirvana* extensively and\n\
  successfully on the Irish and Scottish coasts between Valentia and Stornoway.\n\
  His house names over the years reflect a particular love of sailing on the west\n\
  coast of Scotland - 'Craigmore' (Isle of Bute); 'Colintraive' (Kyles of Bute);\n\
  'Ardfern' (Argyll) - but he was no stranger to home waters, especially the\nmagical,\
  \ Atlantic fringe West Cork anchorages reached so comfortably with\n*Nirvana*. He\
  \ became one of the founding members of the Irish Cruising Club\nduring their first\
  \ 1929 meet at Glengarriff. An ambitious and sometimes stormy\n1932 family cruise\
  \ to Cornwall and Devon won the Mooneys and *Nirvana* the\nclub's already prestigious\
  \ Falkner Cup - judged by none other than Yachting\nMonthly editor Maurice Griffiths. \
  \      To those who can't imagine sailing\nadventure without electronic guidance\
  \ here's a wonderful description of a closer\nthan wished for encounter with foggy\
  \ Tuskar Rock from *Nirvana*'s 1932 log:\n“We could hear the five minute fog [signal]\
  \ explosion on the Tuskar and wishing\nto see the rock if possible, as it is quite\
  \ steep to on its northern side,\nsteered straight for it. Unfortunately the navigation\
  \ was too good, for in one\nof the intervals between the explosions the rock loomed\
  \ up suddenly, apparently\nalmost overhead and before my crew, who was steering\
  \ could realise it, there was\na jolt and there we were piled up. At that moment\
  \ the gun went off directly\noverhead. I rushed up on deck, saw deep water on both\
  \ sides of us and realised\nwe had crossed the boat slip to the rock, and in a moment\
  \ had the headsails down\nand soon *Nirvana* glided off into deep water.”      Mooney\
  \ wrote that *Nirvana*\nhad been “such a success and so easy to handle by myself\
  \ that I am seriously\nconsidering something larger of at least 16 tons, still single-hander.”\
  \ In the\nevent, a serious illness in 1933 forced the sale of *Nirvana*, but afforded\
  \ time\nto conceive her successor, the remarkable Mooney/ John Kearney/ Fred Shepherd/\n\
  Jack Tyrrell ketch AIDEEN.      In 1934, 30-year-old Irish American Ethel\nCrimmins\
  \ of East Ferry, Cork Harbour, became *Nirvana*'s 2nd owner in tragic but\npassionate\
  \ circumstances. In the fashion of the time known as Mrs Ralph G.\nCrimmins, her\
  \ American husband had perished in a small boat accident the\nprevious year. Determined\
  \ to continue the sailing adventures the couple had\nenjoyed, Ethel bought *Nirvana*,\
  \ hired a paid hand and set sail with some gusto\n- winning *Nirvana*'s 2nd I.C.C.\
  \ Falkner Cup in their first season together for\na round Ireland cruise taking\
  \ in Scottish waters.      By 1937 Ethel had\nemigrated to Baltimore, Maryland,\
  \ and by the late 1930s *Nirvana*'s home port\nhad moved to Holyhead, Wales, for\
  \ a pre and post Second World war period of\nownership by north of England resident\
  \ summer members of Trearddur Bay Sailing\nClub: pre-war by J.W. Williams of Altrincham,\
  \ Cheshire; post-war by Rotherham,\nYorkshire based Robert Garth Gwynne, Dr Philip\
  \ Edgar Pym, and H. Smith. It may\njust be coincidence, but all three of *Nirvana*'s\
  \ early ownerships revolved\naround the dental and medical worlds.      Although\
  \ ownership briefly\ntransferred 1950-51 to James and Simmone Styles of Hull, later\
  \ Poole - members\nof Humber Yawl Club, Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club and later Parkstone\
  \ Yacht Club -\nthere is no evidence to suggest *Nirvana*'s mooring changed from\
  \ Holyhead. By\n1951 a long and stable period of ownership by Belfast Lough/ Strangford\
  \ Lough\nyachtsmen began, and more cruising in Irish and Scottish waters. During\
  \ this\nperiod a practical for inclement weather, though rather ugly doghouse was\n\
  fitted. Albert Strange would not have approved.      1951-1963   Arthur Douglas\n\
  MacIlwaine - Belfast stockbroker, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Officer, member\n\
  of Royal North of Ireland, Royal Ulster and Strangford Lough Yacht Clubs - who\n\
  changed her name to *Nirvana* OF ARKLOW.      1963-1965   John T. McVicker,\nBelfast,\
  \ a RNIYC, RUYC member      1965-1976   Andrew Sheamus Henderson of\nNewton Abbey,\
  \ later Killinchy, a member of Carrickfergus Sailing Club and\nStrangford Lough\
  \ Yacht Club who probably moored *Nirvana* at Whiterock,\nStrangford Lough.    \
  \  1976-1989   Joseph Patrick Hammill of Whiterock,\nKillinchy, Strangford Lough.\
  \      1989-   Peter and Nancy Clay, Woodbridge,\nSuffolk. Peter - brought up sailing\
  \ the counter-sterned 34 ft 6 in Albert\nStrange yawl FIREFLY, owned by his family\
  \ since 1934 - found *Nirvana* OF ARKLOW\nnot in Northern Ireland, but in a very\
  \ appropriate place for such a characterful\nyacht: the wonderfully traditional\
  \ McKellar's Slipway, Kilcreggan, on the Firth\nof Clyde, the last Clyde patent\
  \ slipway yard run by brothers Ronnie and Ian\nMacGrouther and not far from two\
  \ of Billy Mooney's house names, 'Ardbeg' and\n'Colintraive'. *Nirvana*'s wonderful\
  \ story with the Clays began on a soggy early\nsummer 1990 voyage from the Clyde\
  \ to Harwich - perhaps this beautiful and very\ncapable canoe-yawl's longest to\
  \ that point.    ©2023 Iain McAllister/ Sandeman\nYacht Company Ltd. [with appreciation\
