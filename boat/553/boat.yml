full_description: "<p>Storm was built in 1910 by Bundock Brothers at Leigh on Sea,\
  \ and when built she was originally called &quot;Lady Myra&quot;.&nbsp; Myra was\
  \ the wife of the first owner, Mr C Horstead.&nbsp; In the 1911 &amp; 1912 local\
  \ newspapers Lady Myra was reported doing very well in races.&nbsp; She was sold\
  \ in about 1912, and sold again before 1914.&nbsp; The third owner was Norman O\
  \ Searle, and architect, who also designed a similar boat &quot;Ripple&quot; which\
  \ was later owned by the marine artist Fid Harnack, who later illustrated Magic\
  \ of the Swatchways, and the Yachting Monthly, for editor Maurice Griffiths.&nbsp;\
  \ By a co-incidence, Norman Searle was then part owner of Charity (see entry in\
  \ OGA Register) 1924-26, then a gaff cutter but now bermudian, and owned by the\
  \ sister of East Coast Gaffer&#39;s Clare Thomas.&nbsp; Lady Myra/Storm was built&nbsp;as\
  \ a yacht but with the scantlings of a&nbsp;shrimping bawley, but was never used\
  \ for fishing. After the first World War she was sold again, had her first engine\
  \ installed in 1920, and relocated to Burnham, and later West Mersea where she was\
  \ found and bought by Maurice Griffiths, who re-named her Storm.&nbsp; She was owned\
  \ twice by Maurice Griffiths, past editor of Yachting Monthly, and he describes\
  \ her in his books, in particular &#39;Magic of the Swatchways&#39;. In &#39;Dream\
  \ Boats&#39; he describes her as &#39;My little 7 tonner Storm was built as a miniature\
  \ bawley yacht, but with somewhat finer lines, and I always regarded her as one\
  \ of the most endearing little craft I have ever owned.&#39; He had to sell her\
  \ and vowed he&#39;d buy her back which he did six years later.&nbsp; The owner\
  \ between 1924 and 1930 when MG bought her back, was a Mr Eustace Mason, who founded\
  \ the Claygate Cement works.&nbsp; MG sold her again in 1931, and she was re-located\
  \ to Poole, to take part in races organised by the Parkstone Sailing Club.&nbsp;\
  \ The owner then was a Col J M Hulton, a veteran of the Boer Wars, the First World\
  \ War, and the Irish troubles in the 1920&#39;s.&nbsp; There are records of her\
  \ not doing too well in the 1935&nbsp;round the island (IOW) race.&nbsp; Storm drops\
  \ out of the Lloyds Registers in 1937, and the next record I have found was the\
  \ hand written receipt included in her paperwork, when the then owner John Derrick\
  \ of Fareham sold her to David Cade in 1962.&nbsp; John Derrick appears to have\
  \ been an actor in the Portsmouth area, but the record is cold between 1937 and\
  \ 1962 - I would love to find out where she was in those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David\
  \ J Cade passed away on 17 July 2002, when serving as OGA President having owned\
  \ Storm from 1962. Badly damaged in a northerly storm after the 1975 Solent Race\
  \ in Cowes it took David Cade 18 years to rebuild her. Alison, his widow kept her\
  \ on until her death in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of Storm is still original, although\
  \ the cabin has been lengthened/the cockpit made shorter by about 18&quot;.&nbsp;\
  \ I have found and had restored a &quot;Jack Tar&quot; stove, the same as MG had,\
  \ the elderly Kelvin diesel replaced with a more modern Beta, and gradually planks\
  \ have been replaced, the hull re-fastened, the usual on-going process for an old\
  \ boat like Storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
