full_description: "<p>Bonita is 35&#39; long, weighs 9 tons and was built in 1888.\
  \ Most boats surviving from those days are old fishing boats, but Bonita was built\
  \ as a yacht, Crossfields giving her a clipper bow.She was originally a cutter and\
  \ likely to have been open after of the mast, the shell-back cabin probably being\
  \ a twentieth addition. She was altered from cutter to yawl in 1907. She is a very\
  \ elegant old lady, but there are few luxuries when living aboard. She has been\
  \ in the family since 1937, when she was bought for &pound;90. She is largely original,\
  \ and unlike many old boats, she has never been rebuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013,\
  \ Bonita was the oldest boat to take part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge, celebrating\
  \ the OGA&#39;s 50th and her own 125th birthday. The blog of this passage makes\
  \ fascinating reading.</p>"
