  *Bonita* was built in 1888 at Arnside in Cumbria. Owned by the same family since
  1937, she's a very elegant "old lady" and successfully completed the OGA Round
  Britain Challenge circumnavigation of Britain in 2013, her 125th birthday year.
full_description: |-
  *Bonita* is 35' long, weighs 9 tons and was built in 1888. Most boats surviving
  from those days are old fishing boats, but *Bonita* was built as a yacht,
  Crossfields giving her a clipper bow. She was originally a cutter and likely to
  have been open after of the mast, the shell-back cabin probably being a
  twentieth addition. She was altered from cutter to yawl in 1907. She is a very
  elegant old lady, but there are few luxuries when living aboard. She has been in
  the family since 1937, when she was bought for Â£90. She is largely original, and
  unlike many old boats, she has never been rebuilt.


  In 2013, *Bonita* was the oldest boat to take part in the OGA Round Britain
  Challenge, celebrating the OGA's 50th and her own 125th birthday. The blog of
  this passage makes fascinating reading.
