  *Bonita* was built in 1888 at Arnside in Cumbria. Owned by the
  same family since 1937, she's a very elegant "old lady" and successfully
  completed the OGA Round Britain Challenge circumnavigation of Britain in 2013, her
  125th birthday year.
full_description: |+
  *Bonita* is 35' long, weighs 9 tons and was built in 1888.
  Most boats surviving from those days are old fishing boats, but *Bonita* was built
  as a yacht, Crossfields giving her a clipper bow. She was originally a cutter and
  likely to have been open after of the mast, the shell-back cabin probably being
  a twentieth addition. She was altered from cutter to yawl in 1907. She is a very
  elegant old lady, but there are few luxuries when living aboard. She has been
  in the family since 1937, when she was bought for &pound;90. She is largely original,
  and unlike many old boats, she has never been rebuilt.

  In 2013, *Bonita* was the oldest boat to take part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge, celebrating
  the OGA's 50th and her own 125th birthday. The blog of this passage makes fascinating reading.
