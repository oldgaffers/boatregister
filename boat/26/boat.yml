short_description: "*Bonita* was built in 1888 at Arnside in Cumbria. Owned by the
  same family since\n1937, she's a very elegant \"old lady\" and successfully completed
  the OGA Round\nBritain Challenge circumnavigation of Britain in 2013, her 125th
  birthday year."
full_description: "*Bonita* is 35' long, weighs 9 tons and was built in 1888. Most
  boats surviving\nfrom those days are old fishing boats, but *Bonita* was built as
  a yacht,\nCrossfields giving her a clipper bow. She was originally a cutter and
  likely to\nhave been open after of the mast, the shell-back cabin probably being
  a\ntwentieth addition. She was altered from cutter to yawl in 1907. She is a very\n
  elegant old lady, but there are few luxuries when living aboard. She has been in\n
  the family since 1937, when she was bought for £90. She is largely original, and\n
  unlike many old boats, she has never been rebuilt.\n\n\nIn 2013, *Bonita* was the
  oldest boat to take part in the OGA Round Britain\nChallenge, celebrating the OGA's
  50th and her own 125th birthday. The blog of\nthis passage makes fascinating reading."
