  Harrison Butler Z4 tonner fully restored 2005-2019. Rotostay
  head-sail furling system, 2 berths, Yanmar G10 diesel engine, full inventory,
  very comfortable accommodation for two, but easy to sail single handed.

  *Mary Gray* was built from top quality pre-war timber and as she
  has been fully upgraded is not only very sound but looks the part of a classic
  yacht of her era. Professional boat-builders have carried out renewal of keel
  bolts, bilge straps, floors, top of coachroof, rudder and engineers removed her
  engine for a complete overhaul.

  She has been sailing on the Clyde and full details including her history,
  details of her upgrading, lines drawing, origin of her name, are available from her owner.
