  \ has been fully upgraded is not only very sound but looks the part of a classic\

  \ engine for a complete overhaul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has been sailing on the Clyde\
  \ and full details including her history, details of her upgrading, lines drawing,\
  \ origin of her name, are available from her owner.</p>"
