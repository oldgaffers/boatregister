full_description: |-
  There are no records as yet of *Venture*'s builder or build date.There are
  records of 4 *Ventures* registered as trawl boats/nobbys, but none have the same
  dimensions as Venture 220. Close examination of her photos and comparison with
  photos of nobbys including *Lassie of Chester* suggest that she was built by
  John Crossfield at Conway. She has the same narrow sheer plank and rubbing
  strake (moulding) as his fishing nobbys.  Her high topsides for a fishing nobby,
  widish cockpit and narrowish side decks (normally each 1/3 of the beam on a
  fishing nobby), iron guard rail stanchions and cross trees in 1974 suggest that
  she was originally a yacht.

  *Venture* was salvaged in 1965 by Dennis Crompton of Warrington, who gave her a
  major overhaul. He sold her to Jay Cresswell (OGA member) in 1974, who
  re-registered her for commercial fishing on the Beaumaris register (BS 120).  

  Sold south in 1977 after three successful years of work, mostly in Scottish
  waters. New owner was Sam Bayliss (also OGA member). He attempted to buy her
  back in the early 1980s through a proxy but failed. She had a major refit by
  Richard Coles (also OGA member) starting in 1984, including plank and a new
  engine installation. Richard and his daughter took her to the 1996 Brest IFOS.

  Her photo gallery includes an image of her wearing a sail with the Fishing
  Registry CO88. Nobby CO88 was bought during the war by a company taking
  advantage of subsidies paid to the fishing industry. She was abandoned at the
  end of the war in the Manchester Ship Canal. *Venture* recycled her sail even
  though CO88 was a larger boat at 36' x 10'6" x 6'.  It was used as the pattern
  for a new main, which was ordered from Fleetwood Trawler Supply Co. which still
  had a loft at that time. It was a powerful yet manageable sail and enabled
  *Venture* to tow a beam trawl comfortably during her spell fishing as BS120

  The foresail had been made many years earlier, again for another nobby, but was
  like new. The jib was made by Leitch of Tarbert using an earlier sail as the
  pattern.
