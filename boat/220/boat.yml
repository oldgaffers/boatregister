  There is some question over Venture's build date, quoted as 1920-25 or 1890-1910.

  Venture was salvaged in 1965 by Dennis Crompton of Warrington who gave her a major overhaul. He sold her to Jay
  Cresswell (OGA member) in 1974, who re-registerd her for commercial fishing on the
  Beaumaris register (BS 120). Widely regarded in the nobby community as being a Fleetwood-build
  around 1920 because of her powerful bows and hefty build (for a nobby). She was
  an Irish Sea boat rather than nearshore model.
  
  Sold south in 1977 after three successful
  years of work, mostly in Scottish waters. New owner was Sam Bayliss (also OGA member).
  He attempted to buy her back in the early 1980s through a proxy but failed. She
  had a major refit 1996-9, and was for sale in 2004 - 2006
  
  It is possible that she was originally called 'Lizzie' though the name Venture reaches way
  back according to Nobby man, the late Ronnie Baines of Fiddler's Ferry, later
  Deganwy. His view was that she was originally a Fleetwood boat. Curiously, he too
  had owned a nobby called Venture, but a different boat. There has been another Venture
  afloat and which fished the Morecambe Bay area. A grp hull modelled off the Sir William
  Priestley.
  
  The registration CO88 is a 'red herring'. The fishing Nobby CO88 was bought during the war
  by a company taking advantage of subsidies paid to the fishing industry. She was abandoned at
  the end of the war in the Manchester Ship Canal. Venture recycled her sail. It was used as the pattern
  for a new main, which was ordered from Fleetwood Trawler Supply Co. which still had a loft at that time.
  It was a powerful yet manageable sail and enabled *Venture* to tow a beam trawl comfortably.
  
  The foresail had been made many years earlier, again for another nobby, but was
  like new. The jib was made by Leitch of Tarbert using an earlier sail as the pattern/
