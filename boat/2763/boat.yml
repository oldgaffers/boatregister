full_description: "<p>&#39;Minx&#39; is one of several GRP Morecambe Bay prawners\
  \ built from a mould taken from the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; the Morecambe\
  \ Bay Fishermen&#39;s Association&#39;s private lifeboat which served from 1934\
  \ to 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built by Eric Bergqvist and designed by Crossfield, Peter\
  \ Tomlinson purchased the hull of &#39;Minx&#39;&nbsp;in 1990, fitted her out and\
  \ rigged her over a five year period, launching her in 1996 and sailing in the Bristol\
  \ Channel area. In 2015 she changed hands and moved to the South West, regularly\
  \ taking part in events including Falmouth and Plymouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\
  \n<p>&#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; was&nbsp;the Morecambe Fisherman&rsquo;s private\
  \ lifeboat built by William Crossfield &amp; Sons in 1934. Lady Priestley donated\
  \ the money in memory of her husband, a Bradford mill owner, MP and supporter of\
  \ the RNLI. Sir William had been involved in fundraising for the Spurn Head lifeboat\
  \ &#39;City of Bradford II&#39;. Morecambe was popular with holidaymakers from Bradford\
  \ and was often known as &#39;Bradford by the Sea&#39;.&nbsp;The naming of the &#39;Sir\
  \ William Priestley&#39; was attended by the Lord Mayors of Bradford and Leeds and\
  \ she was paraded through the streets of Morecambe and Heysham watched by 20,000\
  \ people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six or more replicas have been made of the &#39;Sir William\
  \ Priestley&#39; in glass fibre using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric\
  \ Bergqvist, a Cheshire boatbuilder in return for royalties of &pound;25 for every\
  \ boat built. The &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; was retired from service in 1987\
  \ and taken to Lancaster Maritime Museum to await restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Alasdair\
