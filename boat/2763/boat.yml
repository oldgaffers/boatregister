  *Minx* is one of several GRP Nobbys built from a mould taken from the 'Sir William Priestley'
  the Morecambe Bay Fishermen's Association's private lifeboat which served from 1934 to 1987.

  Peter Tomlinson purchased the hull of 'Minx' in 1990, fitted her out and rigged her
  over a five yearperiod, launching her in 1996 and sailing in the Bristol Channel area.
  In 2015 she changed hands and moved to the South West, regularly taking part in events
  including Falmouth and Plymouth.

  In 2024 she changed hands again and her homeport in now Falmouth.

  'Sir William Priestley' was the Morecambe Fisherman’s private lifeboat
  built by William Crossfield & Sons in 1934. Lady Priestley donated the money
  in memory of her husband, a Bradford mill owner, MP and supporter of the RNLI.
  Sir William had been involved in fundraising for the Spurn Head lifeboat 'City
  of Bradford II'. Morecambe was popular with holidaymakers from Bradford and
  was often known> as 'Bradford by the Sea'. The naming of the 'Sir William Priestley'
  was attended> by the Lord Mayors of Bradford and Leeds and she was paraded through
  the streets> of Morecambe and Heysham watched by 20,000 people.

  Six or more replicas have been made of the 'Sir William Priestley' in glass fibre
  using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric Bergqvist, a Cheshire boatbuilder
  in return for royalties of £25 for every boat built. The 'Sir William Priestley'
  was retired from service in 1987 and taken to Lancaster> Maritime Museum to
  await restoration.
