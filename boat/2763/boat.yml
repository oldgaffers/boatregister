  \ Association's\nprivate lifeboat which served from 1934 to 1987.\n\n\nBuilt by\
  \ Eric Bergqvist and designed by Crossfield, Peter Tomlinson purchased\nthe hull\
  \ of 'Minx' in 1990, fitted her out and rigged her over a five year\nperiod, launching\
  \ her in 1996 and sailing in the Bristol Channel area. In 2015\nshe changed hands\
