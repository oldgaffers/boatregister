full_description: "Originally a Bermudan sloop, 'Norwegian Girl' was re-rigged as\
  \ a gaff cutter at\nPenpol, Cornwall in 1985. First of type with approximately 30\
  \ built, but mainly\nexported to St Helena as an inshore fishing boat fleet! Those\
  \ were fitted with\nlarge diesel engines and no sailing rig.\_\n\n\nNorwegian Girl\
  \ was originally fitted with a Dolphin direct drive petrol engine\nbut now re-engined\
  \ with a 10hp Bukh diesel.\_\n\n\nThe sail plan was redrawn that required a much\
  \ longer bowsprit and the rudder\nredesigned and had a new suit of sails in 2011.\n\
  \n\nIn 2018 she had her floors and sole redesigned and rebuilt. The foredeck and\n\
  deckbeams \_renewed and redesigned to be able to retract her bowsprit. Also all\n\
  electrics were updated.\_\n\n"
