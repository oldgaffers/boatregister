full_description: '<p>Originally a Bermudan sloop, ''Norwegian Girl'' was re-rigged
  as a gaff cutter at Penpol, Cornwall in 1985. First of type with approximately 30
  built, but mainly exported to St Helena as an inshore fishing boat fleet! Those
  were fitted with large diesel engines and no sailing rig.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Norwegian Girl was originally fitted with a Dolphin direct drive petrol engine
  but now re-engined with a 10hp Bukh diesel.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The sail plan was redrawn that required a much longer bowsprit and the rudder
  redesigned and had a new suit of sails in 2011.</p>

  <p>In 2018 she had her floors and sole redesigned and rebuilt. The foredeck and
  deckbeams &nbsp;renewed and redesigned to be able to retract her bowsprit. Also
  all electrics were updated.&nbsp;</p>'
