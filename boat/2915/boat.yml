full_description: |-
  Originally a Bermudan sloop, 'Norwegian Girl' was re-rigged as a gaff cutter at
  Penpol, Cornwall in 1985. First of type with approximately 30 built, but mainly
  exported to St Helena as an inshore fishing boat fleet! Those were fitted with
  large diesel engines and no sailing rig. 


  Norwegian Girl was originally fitted with a Dolphin direct drive petrol engine
  but now re-engined with a 10hp Bukh diesel. 


  The sail plan was redrawn that required a much longer bowsprit and the rudder
  redesigned and had a new suit of sails in 2011.


  In 2018 she had her floors and sole redesigned and rebuilt. The foredeck and
  deckbeams  renewed and redesigned to be able to retract her bowsprit. Also all
  electrics were updated.
