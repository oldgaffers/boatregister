  *Hatalinqua* is a modern classic yacht built in the early 1990’s using the WEST
  system epoxy system to construct a wood epoxy composite hull, sheathed with an
  epoxy laminate. This construction technique produces a very strong and light
  weight hull while avoiding the maintenance burden associated with a traditional
  wooden hull.


  The design of *Hatalinqua* was inspired by the 1922 Dickies of Tarbert yawl
  *Macaria*, designed by Peter Dickie; himself drawing on inspiration from the
  numerous Albert Strange designs the yard were producing at the time. The lines
  of *Hatalinqua* have been stretched and tweaked to provide a little more space
  below decks and a larger cockpit on deck for the comfort of crew.
