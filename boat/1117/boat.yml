full_description: "<p>Originally built for the Baxter Family &#39;Comrades&#39; was\
  \ sold in the 1960s to the Clarkson Family who changed the name to &#39;Natashquant&#39;,\
  \ the name coming from Africa where the father had served in the army.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>In the 1970s they moved to Ramsey, Isle of Man, when Fred Crow owned her. He\
  \ changed the name to &#39;Ena-Jane&#39; after his daughters, fishing no RY7.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1973 she fell over in Ramsey Dock and smashed her starboard side. Joe\
  \ Pendeton bought her and rebuilt her launching her in 1976. Over the next six years\
  \ he sailed her all over the Irish Sea and up to the Hebrides, changing her name\
  \ back to &#39;Comrades&#39;. He used her for fishing and racing in gaffer events.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1982 Harry Bloomfield bought her and took her to Liverpool, keeping\
  \ her at Fidlers Ferry on the Mersey. He was the first President of the Nobby Owners\
  \ Association. He sailed her up to his death in 1994. The boat passed to his daughter\
  \ Gwendoline Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike Griffiths bought her from the family, did\
  \ some repairs, laid new decks and changed the name to &#39;Thira lll&#39;. He sold\
  \ her in May 2000 to Dr Peter Favershame who kept her in the Collingwood Dock Liverpool.\
  \ He had some work done and replaced the engine. He replaced the keel. He did not\
  \ use her much and moved her to Liverpool Marina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was bought by\
  \ Robert Angell in 2008 who moved her to Fidlers Ferry and over the winter made\
  \ her seaworthy, changing the name back to &#39;Comrades&#39;. Since 2013 she&#39;s\
  \ been moored at Conwy. She won &#39;best turned out Boat in Liverpool&#39; 2009&nbsp;and\
  \ 2012, the Conwy Nobby Race, 2012 and Small Nobby Race, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert\
  \ Angell has carried out regular maintenance, replacing the cabin top and foredeck.\
  \ He rebuilt the cockpit and replaced&nbsp;the mast, gaff and bowsprit, all running\
  \ rigging and blocks. Down below he added a new cooker, solid fuel stove, modern\
  \ electrics, water tank and cushions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert has sailed her around\
  \ the Irish Sea from Liverpool to the Isle of Man and Ireland.</p>"
