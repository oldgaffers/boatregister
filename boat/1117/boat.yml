full_description: |-
  Originally built for the Baxter Family *Comrades* was sold in the 1960s to the
  Clarkson Family who changed the name to *Natashquant*, the name coming from
  Africa where the father had served in the army.    
  
  In the 1970s they moved to Ramsey, Isle of Man, when Fred Crow owned her. He 
  changed the name to *Ena-Jane* after his daughters, fishing no RY7.   
  
  In 1973 she fell over in Ramsey Dock and smashed her starboard side. Joe 
  Pendleton bought her and rebuilt her launching her in 1976. Over the next six years 
  he sailed her all over the Irish Sea and up to the Hebrides, changing her name 
  back to *Comrades*. He used her for fishing and racing in gaffer events.   

  In 1982 Harry Bloomfield bought her and took her to Liverpool, keeping 
  her at Fidlers Ferry on the Mersey. He was the first President of the Nobby Owners 
  Association. He sailed her up to his death in 1994. The boat passed to his daughter 
  Gwendoline Hall.
    
  Mike Griffiths bought her from the family, did 
  some repairs, laid new decks and changed the name to *Thira lll*. He sold 
  her in May 2000 to Dr Peter Favershame who kept her in the Collingwood Dock Liverpool. 
  He had some work done and replaced the engine. He replaced the keel. He did not 
  use her much and moved her to Liverpool Marina.
    
  She was bought by Robert Angell in 2008 who moved her to Fidlers Ferry and over the winter made 
  her seaworthy, changing the name back to *Comrades*. Since 2013 she*s 
  been moored at Conwy. She won *Best turned out Boat in Liverpool in 2009 and 
  2012, the Conwy Nobby Race, 2012 and Small Nobby Race, 2011.
    
  Robert Angell has carried out regular maintenance, replacing the cabin top and foredeck. 
  He rebuilt the cockpit and replaced&nbsp;the mast, gaff and bowsprit, all running 
  rigging and blocks. Down below he added a new cooker, solid fuel stove, modern 
  electrics, water tank and cushions.
    
  Robert has sailed her around the Irish Sea from Liverpool to the Isle of Man and Ireland.
