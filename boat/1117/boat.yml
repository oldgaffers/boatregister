full_description: "Originally built for the Baxter Family *Comrades* was sold in the\
  \ 1960s to the\nClarkson Family who changed the name to *Natashquant*, the name\
  \ coming from\nAfrica where the father had served in the army.    \n\nIn the 1970s\
  \ they moved to Ramsey, Isle of Man, when Fred Crow owned her. He \nchanged the\
  \ name to *Ena-Jane* after his daughters, fishing no RY7.   \n\nIn 1973 she fell\
  \ over in Ramsey Dock and smashed her starboard side. Joe \nPendleton bought her\
  \ and rebuilt her launching her in 1976. Over the next six years \nhe sailed her\
  \ all over the Irish Sea and up to the Hebrides, changing her name \nback to *Comrades*.\
  \ He used her for fishing and racing in gaffer events.   \n\nIn 1982 Harry Bloomfield\
  \ bought her and took her to Liverpool, keeping \nher at Fidlers Ferry on the Mersey.\
  \ He was the first President of the Nobby Owners \nAssociation. He sailed her up\
  \ to his death in 1994. The boat passed to his daughter \nGwendoline Hall.\n  \n\
  Mike Griffiths bought her from the family, did \nsome repairs, laid new decks and\
  \ changed the name to *Thira lll*. He sold \nher in May 2000 to Dr Peter Favershame\
  \ who kept her in the Collingwood Dock Liverpool. \nHe had some work done and replaced\
  \ the engine. He replaced the keel. He did not \nuse her much and moved her to Liverpool\
  \ Marina.\n  \nShe was bought by Robert Angell in 2008 who moved her to Fidlers\
  \ Ferry and over the winter made \nher seaworthy, changing the name back to *Comrades*.\
  \ Since 2013 she*s \nbeen moored at Conwy. She won *Best turned out Boat in Liverpool\
  \ in 2009 and \n2012, the Conwy Nobby Race, 2012 and Small Nobby Race, 2011.\n \
  \ \nRobert Angell has carried out regular maintenance, replacing the cabin top and\
  \ foredeck. \nHe rebuilt the cockpit and replaced&nbsp;the mast, gaff and bowsprit,\
  \ all running \nrigging and blocks. Down below he added a new cooker, solid fuel\
  \ stove, modern \nelectrics, water tank and cushions.\n  \nRobert has sailed her\
  \ around the Irish Sea from Liverpool to the Isle of Man and Ireland."
