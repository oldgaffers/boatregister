full_description: "<p>In 1925 Jack Mole placed an order with Charles Kidby for a new\
  \ 15ft Bumkin. She was built complete for &pound;27.10s.0p. Jack had not thought\
  \ of a name but at the insistence of a young nephew he called her Wheezy Anna, after\
  \ the then popular song. He used her for winkling and was a regular competitor in\
  \ the race for bumkins at the West Mersea Town Regatta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She passed\
  \ to the Clarke family, and was working up until the early 1960&rsquo;s. She was\
