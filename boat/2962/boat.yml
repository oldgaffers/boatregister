full_description: "400sq feet sail area Two shipwrights who had emigrated from Norway\
  \ and living/working in the Vancouver area decided to build themselves (all Canadian\
  \ Scandinavians) their own Viking ship to sail and share with the public.  Over\
  \ 2000 volunteers joined and soon formed groups, each was in charge of producing\
  \ a different part of the whole, since there was no budget.  It all came from volunteers\
  \ and donations.  A local log home building company provided the lumber.  Lead ballast,\
  \ a sail, all safety equipment all came from local companies.  Groups made their\
  \ own oars.  A family from a Maple Ridge area farm donated a tree from their back\
  \ yard, which became the mast.  Others produced decorations such as shields and\
  \ costumes.  A local carver designed and carved the dragon figureheads for prow\
  \ and stern and another carver made nameplates and bowplates, and carved a runic\
  \ message in the mast.  Folks worked evenings and weekends over the course of about\
  \ 10 months, with lots of speeches, discussions and ceremonies along the way, and\
  \ for the launch lots of media and dignitaries joined the parade.  We sail almost\
  \ every weekend for 2-hour trips, inviting the public to join us.  It\u2019s been\
  \ quite a ride, and we\u2019re not done yet, so come down and join us for a sail.\
