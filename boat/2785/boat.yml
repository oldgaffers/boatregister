full_description: "<p>SIF's design was based on the famed Herreshoff cutter 'Gloriana'\
  \ of New York YC renown. She was built without an engine, and appears on the Lloyds\
  \ Register of Yachts until 1911 as a 9 ton cutter without motor propulsion.</p>\n\
  <p>After the start of her unsuccesssful round the world cruise in 1934, still without\
  \ an engine but now gaff schooner rigged, she was sold to an ice manufacturer in\
  \ Plymouth. In 1938 her new owner renamed her Icicle IV and had installed a Thornycraft\
  \ 'Handy Billy' petrol engine. During the war years she was preserved, being laid\
  \ up afloat with 3\" of asphalt covering her decks.</p>\n<p>In 1954 she changed\
  \ hands again and, after several years re-fitting in Plymouth, Tony Williams, his\
  \ brother Trevor and family set off to France in 1959 finally arriving in St Tropez\
  \ in the summer of 1961. Icicle IV remained in the Bay of Canubiers until purchased\
  \ by her current owner, William MacInnes who changed her name back to SIF in 1988,\
  \ registering her under the American flag.</p>\n<p>This owner undertook two programmes\
  \ of restoration between 1985 and 2005, alongside taking part in Mediterranean races,\
  \ and winning on several occasions. Since 2005, there has been no more major restoration,\
  \ just regular maintenance and her owner asserts that, 'SIF is in sound shape and\
  \ is well maintained, using products that permit the proverbial 'amateur' to care\
  \ for this yacht, truly a 'one man\u2019s' boat! I am confident she will pass any\
  \ survey desired!'</p>\n<p>After 29 years with her, she was put up for sale with\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.woodenships.co.uk/sailing-yachts/historic-schooner/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">yacht brokers Wooden Ships</a>. Although now sold the site still has a\
  \ very good description of Sif's history.</p>"
