  In 2021 Lune Fox was in the process of being restored. She features a Bison
  Electric Motor with a lithium iron  phosphate battery rather than a petrol
  outboard to avoid the need for pull starts. Lune Fox is now nearly completely
  restored with a black hull, grey bilge paint and Coovar varnish. She looks like
  a different boat.
