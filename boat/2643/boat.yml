full_description: <p>In 2021 Lune Fox was in the process of being restored. She features
  a Bison Electric Motor with a lithium iron &nbsp;phosphate battery rather than a
  petrol outboard to avoid the need for pull starts. Lune Fox is now nearly completely
  restored with a black hull, grey bilge paint and Coovar varnish. She looks like
  a different boat.</p>
