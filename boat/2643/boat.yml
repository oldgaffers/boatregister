full_description: "In 2021 Lune Fox was in the process of being restored. She features\
  \ a Bison\nElectric Motor with a lithium iron \_phosphate battery rather than a\
  \ petrol\noutboard to avoid the need for pull starts. Lune Fox is now nearly completely\n\
  restored with a black hull, grey bilge paint and Coovar varnish. She looks like\n\
  a different boat.\n\n"
