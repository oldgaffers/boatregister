full_description: |-
  Built in 2005 of strip construction in Suffolk and Essex, *Crow* is based in
  Faversham. She is a centreboard gaff ketch based on Phil Bolger's Moccasin
  design and incorporates many modern features such as carbon fibre mast and
  spars. The mizzen furls by revolving the mast. 


  Phil Bolger designed a series of Shoal draft centreboard yachts “inspired” by
  Thames sailing barges in that they rely on flat mid sections and vertical sides
  to provide much of their stability but have beautifully shaped ends to help them
  ease their way through the waves. Because they don’t need a lot of ballast to
  simply hold them down in the water they are light and easily driven and
  therefore fast. Apparently some people are concerned about the seagoing
  capabilities of Phil Bolger’s shoal-draft designs, but *Crow*’s bigger sister
  the schooner *Barn Owl*, 50ft on deck 3ft draft with centreboards raised sailed
  to America and back with no problems. And the smaller Cat ketch *Rhomp* 30ft on
  deck 18ins draft with centerboard up and no and no engine sailed right through
  the eye of a hurricane without unduly frightening her single handed skipper
  though his mizzen sail did disintegrate. 


  *Crow* has sailed to Holland and as far as Penzance without any problems. One
  aspect of these designs which can be amusing is that skippers of other yachts
  assume that because of their size there must be plenty of water under them. One
  example was in *Crow* racing in the rivers above Harwich when a bigger faster
  yacht tried to overtake us to windward when we were scooting through the
  shallows with the centerboard up. Not a good idea. 


  We had an exhilarating run up the Chanel while returning from Cornwall. The wind
  was gusting force 7 from behind. With just the jib and the mizzen set and the
  engine running quietly it was pure joy.

    Price set is true value, but negotiable, as with deepest regret Bob Berk’s
    children are having to sell *Crow* because of his deteriorating dementia. The
    children want *Crow* to go to someone who will sail her and love her as much as
    he loves her.


    *Crow* is a 38ft shoal daft ketch with a centreboard, based on Phil Bolger’s
    Moccasin Design. She is however, slightly longer, heavier and rigged with a
    Gaff. Length on deck 38ft Length over Spars 50ft Beam 10ft Draft centreboard
    raised 2ft Draft centreboard down 5ft 9ins Included in her draft is a 10ins deep
    full length keel which contains nearly 3000lbs of lead located around her centre
    board slot. Her engine is a Kohler diesel engine series KDW model 702. It is a
    four-stroke diesel engine with two cylinders in line liquid cooled. Fitted in
    2021 The engine turns a Featherstream folding propeller. Other mechanical gear,
    Lofrans electric Anchor Winch and Raymarine Autopilot.  **Rig** Technically in
    the UK she’s a ketch as her mizzenmast is stepped forward of the rudder but Phil
    Bolger called her a yawl because in America their definition is slightly
    different. Her mainmast isstepped very far forward in a Broards type tabernacle.
    The mizzen sail is furled revolving it’s mast which has a furling drum just
    above the deck. Originally the mizzenmast would be simply lifted out and in for
    low bridges and maintenance but she now has a clamp on hinged strut which makes
    the process less exciting. The masts and gaff are made from carbon fibre tubes
    supplied by Compotech Booms, the other spars Douglas Fir. Sails Main jib and
    ghoster by Jeckles and mizzen by Wilkinson Sails. 


    Her boomed Jib is semi balanced, it’s pivot is slightly back from the tack,
    which prevents the aft end lifting to much as the sheet is released. There are
    lines attached to the forward end of the boom which lead back to the cockpit
    down each side of the deck. When running before the wind as the main starts to
    blanket the jib, a sharp pull on the leeward line will swing the jib out to
    windward where it will pull beautifully. There are tracks along the gunwales so
    she could sheet a variety of headsails but she sails so well with her working
    jib that she no longer uses any. 


    The gaff mainsail is loose footed with a clew attached to a car so the draft of
    the sail can be adjusted to suit the wind direction.


    **Accommodation**


    She sleeps four, which includes two in a double cross-berth at the forward end
    of the saloon, it has doors so can be shut away. The saloon is accessed via
    steep steps down from the bridge deck, to port is the galley with sink, a
    worktop and a Nelson gas cooker, then a Taylors diesel fuelled cabin heater,
    then a hanging cupboard which is accessed from forward and then a settee berth.
    To starboard is a door to the heads compartment which contains a Lavac marine
    toilet, a sit down/crouch down shower, a wash basin and access to storage under
    the bridge-deck. The waste from the toilet can be either pumped straight into
    the sea or in a holding tank for disposal ashore. Next is the chart table with a
    fridge under the seat and then another settee berth. The cockpit seats are long
    enough to sleep on and she has an inflatable cockpit tent that has never been
    used.  **The Hull** The strip-planked hull (Cedar?) and marine ply deck, all
    sheathed with glass and epoxy was built by Spirit Yachts Ltd of Ipswich. She was
    then completed by her owner Robert Berk who had previously designed and made
    things for a living. While a student he had been awarded a City and Guilds
    Silver Medal for Cabinet making. In spite of having her under cover next to his
    house and workshop and working on her almost full time it took him three years
    to complete her.  **Performance** 


    How does she sail? The answer? Really well. The Old Gaffers Association class
    her as a Hot Shot their definition being boats built for racing, when in fact
    she is a comfortable well equipped cruising yacht.
