full_description: "<p>&#39;Styx&#39; was one of the first of the Rivers Class boats\
  \ built by Crossfields at Arnside in 1912 - 1914. She is known to have won the class\
  \ races through the 1920s and 1930s as well&nbsp;as doing well in races from the\
  \ Wirral to the Isle of Man in the 1960s. Following her sinking in 1986, she returned\
  \ to Liverpool and was&nbsp;rebuilt by Steve Roberts, 1990. She was surveyed by\
  \ Roger Lorenz in 1994, reporting that &#39;Styx&#39;&nbsp;as &quot;good looking&quot;,\
  \ &quot;well-built&quot; and &quot;obviously well-cared for recently, showing none\
  \ of the usual faults of her type.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Lombardini diesel was installed\
  \ in 1996 to cope with strong tides in the Conwy estuary, North Wales. With new\
  \ mast and bowsprit rigged 2001 and new Dawson sails to the original Rivers plan\
  \ she excelled in North Wales Nobby races. A large topsail makes for very interesting\
  \ sailing. In the 1999 Conwy River Festival, &#39;Styx&#39; won overall first prize,\
  \ first small nobby prize and the seamanship prize, which she won&nbsp;again in\
  \ 2001.</p>"
