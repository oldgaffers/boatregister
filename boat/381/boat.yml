full_description: |
  Built in Cardif, 1875, Madcap worked as a Bristol Channel Pilot
  Cutter until after World War I when she was sold and converted for leisure use.

  Owned by Commander John Burfield, Birdham Pool, for many years in 1970s and
  1980s, he sold the boat when he was in his 80s.

  Madcap cruised extensively since 1998, including the west coast of Greenland, via Iceland, from
  Ireland south to Cornwall, Brittany, the Mediterreran, Almerimar, Morocco, Palma
  and Alicante, down to the Azores and Lorient and north to the west coast of Scotland.
