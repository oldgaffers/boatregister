short_description: Built by A H Arp at Laboe in Germany to a Fife design in 1921,
  Dirk II featured in a book written by her then owner Hans Domizlaff about his cruises
  in the Baltic in the 1920s. She was converted to a Bermudian yawl, then a Bermudian
  ketch.
full_description: <p>Her owner since 1994, Graham Benton, converted her back to the
  original gaff yawl design in 1997. Graham has, almost single-handed, returned a
  fine yacht that had lost her way almost to her original perfection. She participated
  in the America Cup Jubilee event in 2001 and in 2002 cruised Brittany for several
  months. Dirk II is a boat to watch in OGA races. At YOGAFF 2007 she sports a mizzen
  again.</p>
