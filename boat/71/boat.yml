full_description: "<p>&#39;Stormy Petrel&#39; is a Whitstable oyster smack built by\
  \ Charles and Richard Perkins. She was owned by Seasalter and Ham, the oyster fishery\
  \ company, and employed as their watch boat until just after the Second World War.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Just after the war she was purchased by Bob Roberts, of SB Cambria, and\
  \ then bought by Mr. Richard Norris in 1962. She has been extensively refitted and\
  \ restored, being the last Whitstable smack without an engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ 1968 she won&nbsp; the East Coast OGA Tom Bolton Memorial Cup, and the first true\
  \ smack over the line in the 1968 Maldon Regatta Smack Race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\
