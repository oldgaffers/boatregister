full_description: '<p>Alice was launched on 22nd May 1992 and fitted out in the same
  year. She cruised extensively on on the East coast and spent a couple of years on
  the French canals. She enjoyed a few years semi retirement untill I bought her in
  autumn 2021 (the first weekend that travel from France to the UK was permitted).</p>

  <p>Expect Alice to become a regular sight around the Brittany coast and work permitting
  further afield</p>'
