short_description: <p>Bee is a Tollesbury fishing smack converted to a yacht</p>
full_description: "<p>Built by Frost and Drake of Tollesbury in 1886 and owned by\
  \ the same &nbsp;family until bought by Dr. Gibson some time in the 1950s or 60s.\
  \ She was &nbsp;known locally as the \u201COdd Times\u201D because the yard built\
  \ her between &nbsp;other jobs when time was available. The timber used was left\
  \ over from &nbsp;other jobs.</p>\n<p>After the second world war she was used for\
  \ raking &nbsp;white weed, then laid up for a while before being sold to Dr Gibson.\
  \ Dr &nbsp;Gibson had a number of planks renewed, the cement ballast chipped out,\
  \ &nbsp;and a cabin top added which gave her accommodation for 6 people. She was\
  \ &nbsp;loaned to the Fellowship Afloat Charitable Trustfor 3 years up to 1977,\
  \ &nbsp;but then returned to being sailed privately.</p>\n<p>New deck beams, &nbsp;mast\
  \ and boom have been fitted. In 1977 she was sailed to St. &nbsp;Catherine's with\
  \ the scroll of Tollesbury, to be presented to H.M the &nbsp;Queen. Walter Musset\
  \ and Sam Gurton, two 84 year olds sailed her with Dr &nbsp;Gibson, both of whom\
  \ used to sail the <em>Williams and Emily </em>in the past.</p>"
