short_description: <p>&#39;Quintet&#39;, a traditional cutter, with Bermudan rig,
  was built in 1953 to a design from the drawing board of Reg Freeman of Hordle near
  Lymington. She carried owner, Clive and first mate Les on their circumnavigation
  of Britain in 2005.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Quintet&#39; was converted to cutter from ketch in 1957\
  \ and carries a Bermudan rig on wooden spars. A surveyor&#39;s report of 2004 states:</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>The origin and early history of Quintet are well documented in\
  \ the entries of Lloyds Register of Yachts. It appears that she has excellent provenance.\
  \ She is also remarkably free of clumsy DIY modifications that often plague older\
  \ boats and eventually lead to their loss of character and watertight integrity.\
  \ In her 51 years afloat Quintet has been fortunate to have had few different owners.\
  \ Maintenance work over the years has been far-reaching and extensive. Past projects\
  \ have included such major items as dropping the keel and replacing the bolts, burning\
  \ off all the paint and building up again from scratch, re-decking with plywood\
  \ over the tongue and groove layer, re-engining, replacing the rudder and numerous\
  \ smaller projects. This has all been enormously effective in keeping her at an\
  \ excellent standard for her age.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, her skipper Clive\
  \ undertook a circumnavigation of England with crew-member Les, departing Fosdyke\
  \ in mid-June and returning mid-September. <a href=\"http://www.2oldgitsinaboat.co.uk/\"\
