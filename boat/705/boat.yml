short_description: <p>We understand from the first owner that this boat was exhibited
  at the 1977 Earls Court Boat Show, prior to delivery.</p>
full_description: <p>She had been based in Gosport, Lymington, Beaulieu and Salcombe
  before being purchased in a very poor, virtually derelict, condition in 1996 by
  Graham Mackenzie. He restored her to a seaworthy condition over the following two
  years. The entire plywood structure, exterior and interior, aft of the mast was
  replaced and that forward required heavy repairs as well.</p>
