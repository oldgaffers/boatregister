short_description: |-
  *Transcur* was built in 1889 as an oyster dredger working on the east coast of
  England. She is just over 35ft long weighing 12 tons. *Transcur* was totally
  rebuilt between 1999 and 2001, when she was relaunched.
full_description: |-
  *Transcur* CK 365 was built in 1889, it seems to replace a larger 17 ton smack
  of the same name that was registered out of Maldon as MN11 in 1871. It was in
  1898 that the Maldon *Transcur* disappeared from the register and *Transcur* CK
  365 was first registered.

  Her early history is rather vague and the only thing we know is that she worked
  from the Essex River Crouch and was owned by the Smith Brothers, well known
  oyster merchants of the area. In 1924 she came out of the register and was sold
  for conversion to a yacht. Coamings and skylights were added. In 1937 her first
  engine was fitted on the starboard quarter. She passed through several hands,
  each owner keeping her for approximatly five years. Most of this time was spent
  on the east coast of England.

  In 1998 the Thomas family bought *Transcur* from Lymington on the Solent where
  she had been for 19 years. Not in a sound enough condition to be sailed back to
  the east coast, she came back overland to the front garden where the family
  spent the next two years restoring her, keeping the floors but the rest of the
  boat was so rotten it needed replacing. She was returned to her original gaff
  rig which she lost in the late 50s. Since her restoration she has been sailed
  regularly to Holland each year for family holidays.

  Unlike many smacks, she is sailed by a family and cruised extensivly.
