full_description: "<p>Transcur CK 365 was built in 1889, it seems to replace a larger\
  \ 17 ton smack of the same name that was registered out of Maldon as MN11 in 1871.\
  \ It was in 1898 that the Maldon &#39;Transcur&#39; did not appear in the register\
  \ and &#39;Transcur CK 365&#39; was first registered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her early history\
  \ is rather vague and the only thing we know is that she worked from the Essex River\
  \ Crouch and was owned by the Smith Brothers, well known oyster merchants of the\
  \ area. In 1924 she came out of the register and was sold for conversion to a yacht.\
  \ Coamings and skylights were added. In 1937 her first engine was fitted on the\
  \ starboard quarter. She passed through several hands, each owner keeping her for\
  \ approximatly five years. Most of this time was spent on the east coast of England.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1998 the Thomas family bought Transcur from Lymington on the Solent\
  \ where she had been for 19 years. Not in a sound enough condition to be sailed\
  \ back to the east coast, she came back overland to the front garden where the family\
  \ spent the next two years restoring her, keeping the floors but the rest of the\
  \ boat was so rotten it needed replacing. She was returned to her original gaff\
  \ rig which she lost in the late 50s. Since her restoration she has been sailed\
  \ regularly to Holland each year for family holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike many\
  \ smacks, she is sailed by a family and cruised extensivly.</p>"
