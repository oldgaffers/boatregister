short_description: "Saunterer was designed in 1899 and was one of Charles Sibbick's\
  \ last designs, when he was exploring what he called \u201Cfast cruisers'' - she\
  \ is 16 tons and is 47 feet on the deck (62 with spars) and is extremely strongly\
  \ built with double oak frames. She has almost all her original timbers including\
  \ deck and is a good working example of the later evolution of Sibbick\u2019s craft\
  \ \u2013 quite different from his very light displacement racers of the 1890s."
