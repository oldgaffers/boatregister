short_description: <p>&#39;Onward of Ito&#39; is a classic gaff&nbsp;cutter built
  in 1923 along Itchen Ferry lines, her original fishing no. being SU16. Like many
  Itchen Ferries, she was converted to a yacht and used for leisure sailing and racing.</p>
full_description: "<p>25ft LOD, 9ft beam, &#39;Onward of Ito&#39; was built in 1923\
  \ as an inshore fishing boat on Itchen Ferry lines, commissioned by Alfred Parker\
  \ whose nickname was Ito. Converted to a yacht following her early fishing career,\
  \ she underwent a big restoration by Traditional Sail in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her\
  \ early fascinating history is told in a Classic Boat article published 1993.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She has been extremely well maintained and changed hands in 2019. She is\
  \ a well-known little gaffer having cruised the Solent and English Channel in OGA\
  \ events for many years. Once owned by Norman Gaches, who spent five years on restoration\
  \ in the 1980s, many Solent OGA members&nbsp;may remember she remained &ldquo;Norman&rsquo;s\
  \ Boat&rdquo; even after Martyn Jenkins bought her around 1989/1990.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>In 2019 her new owner moved her to Greenwich on the River Thames.</p>"
