short_description: |-
  'Onward of Ito' is a classic gaff cutter built in 1923 along Itchen Ferry lines,
  her original fishing no. being SU16. Like many Itchen Ferries, she was converted
  to a yacht and used for leisure sailing and racing.
full_description: |-
  25ft LOD, 9ft beam, 'Onward of Ito' was built in 1923 as an inshore fishing boat
  on Itchen Ferry lines, commissioned by Alfred Parker whose nickname was Ito.
  Converted to a yacht following her early fishing career, she underwent a big
  restoration by Traditional Sail in 2000.


  Her early fascinating history is told in a Classic Boat article published 1993.


  She has been extremely well maintained and changed hands in 2019. She is a
  well-known little gaffer having cruised the Solent and English Channel in OGA
  events for many years. Once owned by Norman Gaches, who spent five years on
  restoration in the 1980s, many Solent OGA members may remember she remained
  “Norman’s Boat” even after Martyn Jenkins bought her around 1989/1990.


  In 2019 her new owner moved her to Greenwich on the River Thames.
