  *Grace* is quite unusual for a Tamarisk 24, she has a large open cockpit and
  small   bow cuddy. She is styled to resemble an Itchen Ferry.
full_description: |-
  *Grace* was previously called *Small Hopes*, she was moored in Mount Lake,
  Keyhaven. Some years ago, she was purchased, transported to Kemps Quay in
  Southampton and underwent a very extensive refit. At the end of the refit, she
  was named *Grace.*


  *Grace* changed hands, and went to Wooton Creek on the Isle of Wight for a few
  years. We purchased *Grace* in June '23, and moved her back to Keyhaven where
  she is currently moored.
