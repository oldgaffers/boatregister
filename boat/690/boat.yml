short_description: |-
  Not to be confused with *Gweneth* of 1901, a cutter which had been owned by the
  same person who commissioned this *Gweneth* of 1911.
full_description: |-
  *Gweneth* was built in 1911 at Woolston and is believed to be the only yacht
  credited solely to Robert Balderston jr. as her designer when aged 25 and
  working in his uncle's offices at William Fife & Son. He added Fife to his name
  in 1914, to be known as R.B. Fife.Â  Written off in 1952 after an explosion
  aboard, but repaired with raised, stepped cabin top added.


  Re-located to the East Coast in 1991 and (still!) undergoing restoration.
