short_description: <p>The &#39;Cine Mara&#39; is a Galway Hooker, built on the lines
  of the famous &lsquo;Truelight&rsquo; from Ireland, by Dutchman, Rik Janssen in
  the Netherlands.</p>
full_description: "<p>The lines for &#39;Cine Mara&#39; were taken and drawings made\
  \ by Joe Murphy from Dublin. He provided Dutchman, Rik Janssen, with these plans\
  \ for building his first Hooker the &lsquo;Moorhen&rsquo;. &lsquo;Cine Mara&rsquo;\
  \ is the second Hooker in Holland, and one of the very few sailing outside Ireland.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Transferring the&nbsp;original concept of the half-decked open boat to\
  \ the fully decked one that is &lsquo;Cine Mara&rsquo;, together with Rik being\
  \ a Dutchman, led to the choice of steel as building material. It gives more headroom\
  \ and space inside and she still keeps her typical rounded skin. In 2009 the keel\
  \ was laid in the yard of Gerard Kroes, in Leeuwarden, and during the following\
  \ years Rik finished her ready to launch in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the fully\
  \ decked copy was the wish to sail her further away from home waters in Holland.\
  \ So the second year of her floating existence she joined the OGA Round Britain\
  \ Challenge in 2013. She attracted much attention everywhere she showed up, and\
  \ needless to say, especially in her &lsquo;home&rsquo; waters of Ireland. Here\
  \ the rightful critics admitted her into the genuine Hooker fleet, but only after\
  \ having&nbsp;her&nbsp;baptised with a small drop of &lsquo;Irish&rsquo; Holy water,\
  \ where the rest of the bottle had&nbsp;to be finished by the crew.</p>"
