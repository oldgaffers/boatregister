  The *Cine Mara* is a Galway Hooker, built on the lines
  of the famous *Truelight* from Ireland, by Dutchman, Rik Janssen in
  the Netherlands.
full_description: |+
  The lines for *Cine Mara* were taken and drawings made
  by Joe Murphy from Dublin. He provided Dutchman, Rik Janssen, with these plans
  for building his first Hooker the &lsquo;Moorhen&rsquo;. *Cine Mara*
  is the second Hooker in Holland, and one of the very few sailing outside Ireland.
  
  Transferring the&nbsp;original concept of the half-decked open boat to
  the fully decked one that is *Cine Mara*, together with Rik being
  a Dutchman, led to the choice of steel as building material. It gives more headroom
  and space inside and she still keeps her typical rounded skin. In 2009 the keel
  was laid in the yard of Gerard Kroes, in Leeuwarden, and during the following
  years Rik finished her ready to launch in 2012.
  
  The aim of the fully decked copy was the wish to sail her further away from
  home waters in Holland.
  So the second year of her floating existence she joined the OGA Round Britain
  Challenge in 2013. She attracted much attention everywhere she showed up, and
  needless to say, especially in her 'home' waters of Ireland. Here
  the rightful critics admitted her into the genuine Hooker fleet, but only after
  having her baptised with a small drop of 'Irish' Holy water,
  where the rest of the bottle had to be finished by the crew
