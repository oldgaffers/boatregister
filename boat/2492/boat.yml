  Fitted out by her owner from new between 1998 and 2002, *Lily* is the first boat
  from a Tyrell & Young mould to be fitted with racing rig.
full_description: |-
  *Lily* was launched August 2002 and based at Stone Sailing Club on the River
  Blackwater until 2015. She is a classic full length keel gaff cutter, 28’ long,
  9’ beam, 6’ headroom in the saloon. Her lines were taken from the East Coast
  oyster smack *Secret* and modified for a 28 hp Vetus diesel engine. She has a
  fibreglass hull, her main structure is opepe with topworks in iroko.
  
  Having built several complete boats, Tyrell sold the hull mould to International Marine Designs based in North
  Wales. Further boats were then built by a boatyard based in Norfolk named Marsham.
  Peter Herbert purchased the hull in 1998 and fitted her out over a period of
  three years including the wooden spars.
