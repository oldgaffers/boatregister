  in Brightlingsea, 1980, she's currently based in the Netherlands.
full_description: |-
  *Brandaen* is a steel replica built in Brightlingsea to the lines of racing
  smack *Ellen* and a skellinger. Designed by R Watts, the hull was built at the
  Arma Marine Shipyard. Her Dutch owners started to fit her out in 1987, basing
  the interior on a Victorian style with panelled doors.


  From her base in the Netherlands, *Brandaen* has cruised extensively since 1992
  including the Frisian Islands, Zeeland, east and south coasts of England,
  Brittany, Belgium, Spain and the Azores, the Baltic and Douarnenez. In 2013 she
  took part in the OGA 50th anniversary celebrations on the East Coast and at
  Cowes.
