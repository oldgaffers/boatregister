full_description: "<p>&#39;Brandaen&#39; is a steel replica built in Brightlingsea\
  \ to the lines of racing smack Ellen and a &#39;skellinger&#39;. Designed by R Watts,\
  \ the hull was built at the Arma Marine Shipyard. Her Dutch owners started to fit\
  \ her out in 1987, basing the interior on a Victorian style with panelled doors.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>From her base in the Netherlands, Brandaen has cruised extensively since\
  \ 1992 including the Frisian Islands, Zeeland, east and south coasts of England,\
  \ Brittany, Belgium, Spain and the Azores, the Baltic and Douarnenez. In 2013 she\
  \ took part in the OGA 50th anniversary celebrations on the East Coast and at Cowes.</p>"
