full_description: |-
  Built in Cornwall in 1987 Clara was previously owned by a couple in Georgia, USA
  then sold to a gentleman in Florida who had it only a couple of years. Its
  current owner purchased it in 2021 and has sailed it ever since on the Hudson
  River in New York, USA. How she arrived here from Britain is a mystery. Clara
  was not her original name, I only know this because as the nameplate began to
  wear away I could see another name underneath but was unable to decipher it.
