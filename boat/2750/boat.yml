full_description: "<h3>First published in the OGA East Coast Newsletter, &#39;Eastcoaster&#39;,\
  \ August 2012</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1935, banker Ernest Richards commissioned the famous\
  \ Scottish naval architects GL Watson &amp; Co. to design a capable and seaworthy\
  \ motor sailer. Design no. 561 was built by the Fraserburgh yard of J Noble &amp;\
  \ Co. and launched later that year. Named &#39;Sheemaun&#39;, she was about 45 ft\
  \ overall, 14 ft beam and drew 5 ft, giving a displacement of 25 tons; a substantial\
  \ craft, built to last, of pitch pine on oak with a mahogany wheelhouse.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>Unfortunately, Mr Richards didn&rsquo;t enjoy his new boat for very long\
  \ as &#39;Sheemaun&#39; was placed under the command of Lt Cmdr Calvert-Link in\
  \ July 1939. She was formally drafted into the Royal Navy in August 1941, and in\
  \ her new role as Thames Estuary Defence Patrol Boat, based at Cliffe Fort on the\
  \ Isle of Grain, was armed with twin Hotchkiss heavy machine guns with an effective\
  \ anti-aircraft ceiling of almost 8000 ft. It is not known if &#39;Sheemaun&#39;\
  \ saw any serious action during her formal navy service, but luckily escaped the\
  \ fate of her fellow patrol boat &#39;Aisha&#39; which was mined in the Thames estuary\
  \ in October 1940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually the war came to an end and &#39;Sheemaun&#39;\
  \ was decommissioned in November 1945, but spent two years with the Department of\
  \ Naval Transport before returning to her peacetime role as a comfortable gentleman&rsquo;s\
  \ cruiser. She had several illustrious owners, mainly naval officers, before serving\
  \ as a training ship from 1982 to 1987 at the Pangbourne Nautical College, taking\
  \ many scores cadets on substantial off-shore voyages including UK South coast,\
  \ French North and West coasts, Seine to Paris and Channel Islands.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Then in 1987 she was fortunate to be discovered and purchased by Dr Rodney Pell,\
  \ who with a great deal of support from Mrs Maura Pell, has been extensively restored,\
  \ researched and is fully seaworthy. With her twin diesels she has a range of some\
  \ 800 miles but given a fair wind is quite capable of sailing and &#39;Sheemaun&#39;<em>\
  \ </em>has probably seen in excess of 75,000 miles pass under her keel.&nbsp;</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 2003, another distinction was added to her pedigree when she was identified\
  \ by Admiral of The Fleet Sir Julian Oswald GCB as &lsquo;. . . meriting inclusion\
  \ in the National Register of Historic Vessels<em>.</em>&rsquo; The ultimate accolade\
  \ was awarded in 2012 when &#39;Sheemaun&#39;<em> </em>was invited to take part\
  \ in the &lsquo;Avenue of Sail&rsquo; at the Queen&rsquo;s Jubilee Thames Pageant\
  \ on 3 June and when, as their Flagship, she represented the Little Ship Club.</p>"
