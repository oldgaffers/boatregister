full_description: "<p>Shipwright Colin Swindale, who owned &#39;Telegraph&#39; from\
  \ 1979 to 1986 contributed a two-part article for the OGA Gaffers Log in 1997 providing\
  \ an insight into the history of inshore fishing in the 19th century. The OGA Sailing\
  \ Committee Chair, George Ventris, prefaced the original article by saying: &quot;We\
  \ get the feel of the old boat&#39;s workaday life, yet the humdrum has become a\
  \ notable romantic gesture to keep alive something from what is now a very different\
  \ time. And since that something may have more significance for the future than\
  \ the enthusiasms of the hobbyist, we should all be grateful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <blockquote>There several Telegraphs in the past; a 75 ft. Grimsby (lost 1882) two\
  \ Brightlingsea/Colne smacks (the first lost 1873 and the second 1924), a Leigh\
  \ Bawley, a Thames Barge and two or three steamships. The sole surviving &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ was known by the older fishermen as the &lsquo;Boston Telegraph&rsquo;, to differentiate\
  \ her from the others.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She was built for Boston\
  \ fish merchant William Stringer&#39;s fleet from the insurance monies of earlier\
  \ smack, the &lsquo;Jane and Eliza&rsquo; (BN33) whelker, that was run down whilst\
  \ at anchor in Boston Deeps by a steamship. William advised the Register that she\
  \ had &ldquo;become wreck, owing to the extensive damage done to her&quot; advice\
  \ received November 1905 from the owner as the Register notes. William Stringer\
  \ received &pound;120 from the insurance company to pay for a new vessel, so &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ was down around December 1905. She was first registered 23rd May 1906, being launched\
  \ a few weeks later.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The mast and sails from the\
  \ wreck of &lsquo;Jane and Eliza&rsquo; were transferred to &lsquo;Telegraph and\
  \ after being fitted with a copper at the aft end of the fish hold she went prawning.\
  \ &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; was entered for many local regattas and a photograph of\
  \ 1908 shows her anchored at Frieston Shore waiting for water up to Boston. The\
  \ photograph is captioned &quot;Mr William Stringer&#39;s Telegraph, winner of the\
  \ Regatta. 23rd September 1908&rdquo;. William Stringer&rsquo;s pride was somewhat\
  \ tempered by her return a week later than expected from the Regatta. The crew had,\
  \ with the &pound;5 prize money, attempted to drink the Skegness pubs dry. They\
  \ did however return with a silver cup which was still in the family&#39;s possession\
  \ a few years ago. &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; and her near sister &lsquo;Majestic&rsquo;\
  \ were &quot;noted Regatta winners&quot; for several years in local events. Sadly\
  \ &lsquo;Majestic&rsquo; became a houseboat on the Thames and was broken up around\
  \ 1979.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In 1917 William Stringer was impatiently\
  \ pacing the deck of his new Gostelow built smack &lsquo;Drummer Boy&rsquo;, waiting\
  \ for the tide to flood enough for her to be launched - Gostelow launched all his\
  \ larger smacks sideways from his yard at the end of Pulvertoft Lane - but for some\
  \ reason &lsquo;Drummer Boy&rsquo; slid down the ways early and William Stringer\
  \ was thrown off at the bottom and killed. The ownership of &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ passed to his widow Alice on 10th July 1917.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&rsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ fished uneventfully under sail until an auxiliary engine, a 14hp petrol paraffin\
  \ Kelvin, was added 1st November 1924. The topmast was laid ashore, the crew reduced\
  \ from 4 to 3 and the copper moved to the fore end of the fish hold, as burns in\
  \ the deck beams still testify.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>By the outbreak\
  \ of World War II, &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; was becoming tired and was laid up at\
  \ Boston 2nd July 1945, the ownership having passed to William Stringer&#39;s son\
  \ William Frederick (Eric) on 13th December 1944. Eric had been serving on Atlantic\
  \ convoys and had been torpedoed twice, the second time spending 14 hours in the\
  \ water before being rescued. In 1923. the Stringers had purchased the Norfolk (Kings\
  \ Lynn) built &lsquo;George and Charles&rsquo; and renamed her &lsquo;Freda and\
  \ Nora&rsquo; after Eric&#39;s two sisters, a name that she carries to this day.\
  \ &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; and &lsquo;Freda and Nora&rsquo; both went to Norfolk&#39;s\
  \ yard in 1946 to be rebuilt, Eric expecting &lsquo;Freda and Nora&rsquo; to last\
  \ him 25 years and &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; longer. Telegraph&#39;s rebuild took\
  \ from 1946 to 1948 and cost &pound;4600: &lsquo;Freda and Nora&rsquo; &pound;2500.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>&rsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; was entirely redecked using nearly 3000\
  \ ft. run of 4&quot; x 2&rdquo; Oregon pine on new 8&quot; x 5&quot; oak deck beams,\
  \ all new oak covering boards and stanchions and nearly every top section of frame\
  \ was replaced to the first futtock, being scarphed then strapped with wrought iron\
  \ futtock pieces through bolted. These may have been as original or due to timber\
  \ shortages just after the War.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The hull planking\
  \ was made good and then doubled over using 1&rdquo; wytch elm, making a total planking\
  \ thickness of 21&quot; thick. New rails, rail cappings and hatches completed the\
  \ deck layout as per original, and a short derrick mast and boom were fitted, being\
  \ reputedly her old mainmast cut down. One intriguing remark made by Eric Stringer\
  \ was to the effect that &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; &ldquo;had a double stem&rdquo;\
  \ and so she did. Due to her bow being so fine. when Norfolk&rsquo;s doubled her\
  \ the extra thickness of planking ran right past the existing stem, so they were\
  \ forced to plant another wider stem on the forward side of the original existing\
  \ one, the old stem effectively becoming an outer apron. So there is now 3 ft. of\
  \ solid timber in this area.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The fitting of a &#39;K\
  \ type 44 hp Kelvin diesel&#39; completed the refit and &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ went back to work as a fully powered motor vessel beam trawling for prawns still\
  \ retaining the copper in the forward end of the fish hold. Olsen&#39;s Almanack\
  \ for 1958 shows &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; as a motor vessel with auxiliary sail,\
  \ so presumably she had retained some vestige of canvas even then, but by 1961 no\
  \ canvas was carried at all, as photographs show. Disaster befell early in 1969\
  \ on a fine clear day, &lsquo;Drummer Boy&rsquo; was towing her gear in The Wash\
  \ when &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; collided with her. &lsquo;Drummer Boy&rsquo; sank\
  \ within 2 minutes, fortunately with no loss of life, the crew scrambling on board\
  \ &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; as &lsquo;Drummer Boy&rsquo; sank.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\
  <blockquote>In a seemingly bizarre way, &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; appeared to have\
  \ avenged the death of her owner some 52 years earlier. &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ was held entirely to blame for the accident and Eric Stringer, being under insured,\
  \ lost &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;, &lsquo;Freda and Nora&rsquo; and &lsquo;Arlanza&rsquo;,\
  \ a cockle boat. &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; was sold for &pound;400 to Raymond Maltby\
  \ and Raymond Sargent of Boston on 7th February 1969, and for a profit, to John\
  \ Marshall on 31st March 1969. John Marshall kept her for a few months then sold\
  \ her to J &amp; B D Elington of Kings Lynn, &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; being re-registered\
  \ LN122, a neat move that only entailed painting out the back of the &#39;B&#39;\
  \ in the Portmark.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In Kings Lynn the original anchor\
  \ winch was removed and an offset wheelhouse built to starboard, the boiler removed\
  \ and &#39;A&#39; frames added so &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; could now go fishing with\
  \ an otter trawl. She continued in this guise until finally being decommissioned\
  \ and the registry cancelled, 4th December 1975.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&rsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ lay semi-derelict in Fisher Fleet until Roger Warr of Feltham found her and had\
  \ her towed first to Wells-next-the-Sea, then to Harwich and finally to Woodbridge.\
  \ Robert Simper recorded in &lsquo;Sea Breezes&rsquo; that she had been sold for\
  \ restoration. &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; lay off Whipstocks yard half sinking until\
  \ they hauled her out and Roger Warr completely stripped the hull of all fittings,\
  \ removing the AEC diesel, then all the rails and cappings, most of the stern, 50%\
  \ of the deck and hatches, every vestige of internal accommodation and fittings\
  \ and finally the stem, whereupon he gave up. &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; then languished\
  \ ashore for about 2 years and Whisstocks were desperate to rid themselves of this\
  \ eyesore. They had considered skinning her in polythene and dumping her down river\
  \ and had even offered her to the American Air Force as a bombing target in Wainfleet\
  \ Haven - the Americans replying &quot;Sure, you get it there, we&#39;ll bomb it.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>In August 1979, shipwright Colin Swindale found her, green, with\
  \ caulking hanging out in great loops. He was immediately attracted to both her\
  \ powerful shape and her fine underwater lines, despite her woeful condition. When\
  \ he learnt that the yard had quoted the owner &pound;2,500 to break her up and\
  \ that this would happen by September, he decided to &#39;stick his neck out&#39;\
  \ and save her, as nobody else was going to do anything positive.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>He purchased the hulk from the yard for &pound;1 &quot;and other\
  \ considerations&quot;, namely that she was removed from the yard, one way or another,\
  \ either as firewood or as a boat, within six weeks, and that she left the Deben\
  \ River never to return, the yard being so terrified of any potential liability.\
  \ Despite Eric Stringer&#39;s warnings to him about &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; &quot;bringing\
  \ him trouble&quot;, Colin worked 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, totally renailing,\
  \ recaulking and stopping the hull, and 6 weeks and 1 day later &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ was relaunched. Much to everyone&rsquo;s amazement, including Colin&#39;s, she\
  \ did not leak or even weep when she regained the water. Colin spent the next month\
  \ making &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; fit to tow to Tollesbury, Essex, where he lived\
  \ and in late October 1979, she arrived for the start of a four year rebuild.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Colin had earlier rebuilt a 56 ft. teak ex-steam yacht and from\
  \ the sale of this he funded most of the restoration back to original sailing condition.\
  \ The rebuild entailed a complete new stern including the sternpost, rudder trunking,\
  \ rudder and replanking the port quarter; and forward a new oak 8&quot; x 5&quot;\
  \ stem and outer apron. On deck, 800ft run of 4&quot; x 2&quot; Oregon pine was\
  \ laid in the chain sawn holes, two new deck beams, 16 oak bulwark stanchions, new\
  \ bulwarks and new port and starboard bitt heads. Also, a totally rebuilt original\
  \ windlass, found in a ditch in the back of a semi-derelict boatyard in Boston,\
  \ possibly from the &lsquo;Pam&rsquo;. All new metal deck and hull fittings were\
  \ in the style of the original, the style and shape being gleaned from old photographs\
  \ and the study of three wrecks at Heacham, Norfolk, where they had lain since the\
  \ 1920s. A complete set of sails, spars, standing and running rigging were also\
  \ required, the sail plan being designed using Jane and Eliza&#39;s photograph as\
  \ the definitive article, the mainsail alone being 1200 sq ft, the normal working\
  \ bowsprit jib being 50ft in the hoist and 500 sq ft area, the total working sail\
  \ area being around 2400 sq ft. Colin had purchased a new 50hp diesel for her, but\
  \ this was never fitted and &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; still sails without an engine\
  \ today.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The first sail, and her first under pure\
  \ sail for 64 years, was in September 1983. Whilst &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; performed\
  \ quite well it became apparent that all her sailing ballast must have been removed\
  \ during the 1946 rebuild and a concrete skim of 2 or 3 tons only put in the bilge\
  \ to keep her clean. Colin purchased 13 tons of pig iron, which was installed in\
  \ the next few days throughout the bilge, about 3 or 4 tons finishing up as a small\
  \ mountain in the middle of the fish hold.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The following\
  \ year, Colin added a topmast and &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; took part in several events,\
  \ including the Colne Match that year. In &quot;Yachts &amp; Yachting&quot; Robert\
  \ Simper wrote &quot;A squall hit some of &lsquo;the fleet off the Mersea shore\
  \ and Telegraph&rsquo; was laid right down&quot; and so she was, with the starboard\
  \ spreader end ploughing a furrow through the waves. Amazingly, she did not stop\
  \ but just kept ploughing along on her side. I suppose 38 tons took a lot of stopping.\
  \ One of the crew remarked afterwards how the mainsail had formed itself to the\
  \ shape of the wave pattern.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Colin reluctantly had\
  \ to part with &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; in 1986 and she finished up lying derelict\
  \ at Heybridge Basin for 9 years. All her spars were ashore, rotting in the nettles,\
  \ all the bulwarks and rails had been torn off, and some of the hatches and covering\
  \ boards, leaving her open to the weather. Some of her former crew found her, half\
  \ sunk, and were horrified at her condition and how she had deteriorated in a few\
  \ years. Eventually she was towed to Maldon by &lsquo;Ostrea Rose&rsquo; and a second\
  \ restoration commenced. This consisted of all new covering boards, bulwarks and\
  \ rail cappings, plus 14 new stanchions forward, a new hollow 37 ft spruce boom\
  \ and running rigging.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Sailing again in 1995, visiting\
  \ Shotley Classic Boat Festival and being featured in &ldquo;Classic Boat&quot;\
  \ magazine, in all she was underway 32 times that year and in 1996 a new topsail\
  \ of some 600ft was added to the sail wardrobe. It is hoped that in the future &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;\
  \ will have many a full season of events and festivals.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>by\
