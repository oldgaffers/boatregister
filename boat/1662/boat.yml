  Built in 1906 for William Stringer of Boston, funded by insurance money, when
  the *Jane and Eliza* was run down by a steamship whilst at anchor in the Boston
  Deeps. *Telegraph* has undergone at least three major restorations since the
  1940s.
full_description: "Shipwright Colin Swindale, who owned 'Telegraph' from 1979 to 1986\
  \ contributed a\ntwo-part article for the OGA Gaffers Log in 1997 providing an insight\
  \ into the\nhistory of inshore fishing in the 19th century. The OGA Sailing Committee\
  \ Chair,\nGeorge Ventris, prefaced the original article by saying: \"We get the\
  \ feel of the\nold boat's workaday life, yet the humdrum has become a notable romantic\
  \ gesture\nto keep alive something from what is now a very different time. And since\
  \ that\nsomething may have more significance for the future than the enthusiasms\
  \ of the\nhobbyist, we should all be grateful.\"\n\n\n\n> There several Telegraphs\
  \ in the past; a 75 ft. Grimsby (lost 1882) two Brightlingsea/Colne smacks (the\
  \ first lost 1873 and the second 1924), a Leigh Bawley, a Thames Barge and two or\
  \ three steamships. The sole surviving ‘Telegraph’ was known by the older fishermen\
  \ as the ‘Boston Telegraph’, to differentiate her from the others.\n\n\n\n> She\
  \ was built for Boston fish merchant William Stringer's fleet from the insurance\
  \ monies of earlier smack, the ‘Jane and Eliza’ (BN33) whelker, that was run down\
  \ whilst at anchor in Boston Deeps by a steamship. William advised the Register\
  \ that she had “become wreck, owing to the extensive damage done to her\" advice\
  \ received November 1905 from the owner as the Register notes. William Stringer\
  \ received £120 from the insurance company to pay for a new vessel, so ‘Telegraph’\
  \ was down around December 1905. She was first registered 23rd May 1906, being launched\
  \ a few weeks later.\n\n\n\n> The mast and sails from the wreck of ‘Jane and Eliza’\
  \ were transferred to ‘Telegraph and after being fitted with a copper at the aft\
  \ end of the fish hold she went prawning. ‘Telegraph’ was entered for many local\
  \ regattas and a photograph of 1908 shows her anchored at Frieston Shore waiting\
  \ for water up to Boston. The photograph is captioned \"Mr William Stringer's Telegraph,\
  \ winner of the Regatta. 23rd September 1908”. William Stringer’s pride was somewhat\
  \ tempered by her return a week later than expected from the Regatta. The crew had,\
  \ with the £5 prize money, attempted to drink the Skegness pubs dry. They did however\
  \ return with a silver cup which was still in the family's possession a few years\
  \ ago. ‘Telegraph’ and her near sister ‘Majestic’ were \"noted Regatta winners\"\
  \ for several years in local events. Sadly ‘Majestic’ became a houseboat on the\
  \ Thames and was broken up around 1979.\n\n\n\n> In 1917 William Stringer was impatiently\
  \ pacing the deck of his new Gostelow built smack ‘Drummer Boy’, waiting for the\
  \ tide to flood enough for her to be launched - Gostelow launched all his larger\
  \ smacks sideways from his yard at the end of Pulvertoft Lane - but for some reason\
  \ ‘Drummer Boy’ slid down the ways early and William Stringer was thrown off at\
  \ the bottom and killed. The ownership of ‘Telegraph’ passed to his widow Alice\
  \ on 10th July 1917.\n\n\n\n> ’Telegraph’ fished uneventfully under sail until an\
  \ auxiliary engine, a 14hp petrol paraffin Kelvin, was added 1st November 1924.\
  \ The topmast was laid ashore, the crew reduced from 4 to 3 and the copper moved\
  \ to the fore end of the fish hold, as burns in the deck beams still testify.\n\n\
  \n\n> By the outbreak of World War II, ‘Telegraph’ was becoming tired and was laid\
  \ up at Boston 2nd July 1945, the ownership having passed to William Stringer's\
  \ son William Frederick (Eric) on 13th December 1944. Eric had been serving on Atlantic\
  \ convoys and had been torpedoed twice, the second time spending 14 hours in the\
  \ water before being rescued. In 1923. the Stringers had purchased the Norfolk (Kings\
  \ Lynn) built ‘George and Charles’ and renamed her ‘Freda and Nora’ after Eric's\
  \ two sisters, a name that she carries to this day. ‘Telegraph’ and ‘Freda and Nora’\
  \ both went to Norfolk's yard in 1946 to be rebuilt, Eric expecting ‘Freda and Nora’\
  \ to last him 25 years and ‘Telegraph’ longer. Telegraph's rebuild took from 1946\
  \ to 1948 and cost £4600: ‘Freda and Nora’ £2500.\n\n\n\n> ’Telegraph’ was entirely\
  \ redecked using nearly 3000 ft. run of 4\" x 2” Oregon pine on new 8\" x 5\" oak\
  \ deck beams, all new oak covering boards and stanchions and nearly every top section\
  \ of frame was replaced to the first futtock, being scarphed then strapped with\
  \ wrought iron futtock pieces through bolted. These may have been as original or\
  \ due to timber shortages just after the War.\n\n\n\n> The hull planking was made\
  \ good and then doubled over using 1” wytch elm, making a total planking thickness\
  \ of 21\" thick. New rails, rail cappings and hatches completed the deck layout\
  \ as per original, and a short derrick mast and boom were fitted, being reputedly\
  \ her old mainmast cut down. One intriguing remark made by Eric Stringer was to\
  \ the effect that ‘Telegraph’ “had a double stem” and so she did. Due to her bow\
  \ being so fine. when Norfolk’s doubled her the extra thickness of planking ran\
  \ right past the existing stem, so they were forced to plant another wider stem\
  \ on the forward side of the original existing one, the old stem effectively becoming\
  \ an outer apron. So there is now 3 ft. of solid timber in this area.\n\n\n\n> The\
  \ fitting of a 'K type 44 hp Kelvin diesel' completed the refit and ‘Telegraph’\
  \ went back to work as a fully powered motor vessel beam trawling for prawns still\
  \ retaining the copper in the forward end of the fish hold. Olsen's Almanack for\
  \ 1958 shows ‘Telegraph’ as a motor vessel with auxiliary sail, so presumably she\
  \ had retained some vestige of canvas even then, but by 1961 no canvas was carried\
  \ at all, as photographs show. Disaster befell early in 1969 on a fine clear day,\
  \ ‘Drummer Boy’ was towing her gear in The Wash when ‘Telegraph’ collided with her.\
  \ ‘Drummer Boy’ sank within 2 minutes, fortunately with no loss of life, the crew\
  \ scrambling on board ‘Telegraph’ as ‘Drummer Boy’ sank.\n\n\n\n> In a seemingly\
  \ bizarre way, ‘Telegraph’ appeared to have avenged the death of her owner some\
  \ 52 years earlier. ‘Telegraph’ was held entirely to blame for the accident and\
  \ Eric Stringer, being under insured, lost ‘Telegraph’, ‘Freda and Nora’ and ‘Arlanza’,\
  \ a cockle boat. ‘Telegraph’ was sold for £400 to Raymond Maltby and Raymond Sargent\
  \ of Boston on 7th February 1969, and for a profit, to John Marshall on 31st March\
  \ 1969. John Marshall kept her for a few months then sold her to J & B D Elington\
  \ of Kings Lynn, ‘Telegraph’ being re-registered LN122, a neat move that only entailed\
  \ painting out the back of the 'B' in the Portmark.\n\n\n\n> In Kings Lynn the original\
  \ anchor winch was removed and an offset wheelhouse built to starboard, the boiler\
  \ removed and 'A' frames added so ‘Telegraph’ could now go fishing with an otter\
  \ trawl. She continued in this guise until finally being decommissioned and the\
  \ registry cancelled, 4th December 1975.\n\n\n\n> ’Telegraph’ lay semi-derelict\
  \ in Fisher Fleet until Roger Warr of Feltham found her and had her towed first\
  \ to Wells-next-the-Sea, then to Harwich and finally to Woodbridge. Robert Simper\
  \ recorded in ‘Sea Breezes’ that she had been sold for restoration. ‘Telegraph’\
  \ lay off Whipstocks yard half sinking until they hauled her out and Roger Warr\
  \ completely stripped the hull of all fittings, removing the AEC diesel, then all\
  \ the rails and cappings, most of the stern, 50% of the deck and hatches, every\
  \ vestige of internal accommodation and fittings and finally the stem, whereupon\
  \ he gave up. ‘Telegraph’ then languished ashore for about 2 years and Whisstocks\
  \ were desperate to rid themselves of this eyesore. They had considered skinning\
  \ her in polythene and dumping her down river and had even offered her to the American\
  \ Air Force as a bombing target in Wainfleet Haven - the Americans replying \"Sure,\
  \ you get it there, we'll bomb it.”\n\n\n\n> In August 1979, shipwright Colin Swindale\
  \ found her, green, with caulking hanging out in great loops. He was immediately\
  \ attracted to both her powerful shape and her fine underwater lines, despite her\
  \ woeful condition. When he learnt that the yard had quoted the owner £2,500 to\
  \ break her up and that this would happen by September, he decided to 'stick his\
  \ neck out' and save her, as nobody else was going to do anything positive.\n\n\n\
  \n> He purchased the hulk from the yard for £1 \"and other considerations\", namely\
  \ that she was removed from the yard, one way or another, either as firewood or\
  \ as a boat, within six weeks, and that she left the Deben River never to return,\
  \ the yard being so terrified of any potential liability. Despite Eric Stringer's\
  \ warnings to him about ‘Telegraph’ \"bringing him trouble\", Colin worked 14 hours\
  \ a day, 7 days a week, totally renailing, recaulking and stopping the hull, and\
  \ 6 weeks and 1 day later ‘Telegraph’ was relaunched. Much to everyone’s amazement,\
  \ including Colin's, she did not leak or even weep when she regained the water.\
  \ Colin spent the next month making ‘Telegraph’ fit to tow to Tollesbury, Essex,\
  \ where he lived and in late October 1979, she arrived for the start of a four year\
  \ rebuild.\n\n\n\n> Colin had earlier rebuilt a 56 ft. teak ex-steam yacht and from\
  \ the sale of this he funded most of the restoration back to original sailing condition.\
  \ The rebuild entailed a complete new stern including the sternpost, rudder trunking,\
  \ rudder and replanking the port quarter; and forward a new oak 8\" x 5\" stem and\
  \ outer apron. On deck, 800ft run of 4\" x 2\" Oregon pine was laid in the chain\
  \ sawn holes, two new deck beams, 16 oak bulwark stanchions, new bulwarks and new\
  \ port and starboard bitt heads. Also, a totally rebuilt original windlass, found\
  \ in a ditch in the back of a semi-derelict boatyard in Boston, possibly from the\
  \ ‘Pam’. All new metal deck and hull fittings were in the style of the original,\
  \ the style and shape being gleaned from old photographs and the study of three\
  \ wrecks at Heacham, Norfolk, where they had lain since the 1920s. A complete set\
  \ of sails, spars, standing and running rigging were also required, the sail plan\
  \ being designed using Jane and Eliza's photograph as the definitive article, the\
  \ mainsail alone being 1200 sq ft, the normal working bowsprit jib being 50ft in\
  \ the hoist and 500 sq ft area, the total working sail area being around 2400 sq\
  \ ft. Colin had purchased a new 50hp diesel for her, but this was never fitted and\
  \ ‘Telegraph’ still sails without an engine today.\n\n\n\n> The first sail, and\
  \ her first under pure sail for 64 years, was in September 1983. Whilst ‘Telegraph’\
  \ performed quite well it became apparent that all her sailing ballast must have\
  \ been removed during the 1946 rebuild and a concrete skim of 2 or 3 tons only put\
  \ in the bilge to keep her clean. Colin purchased 13 tons of pig iron, which was\
  \ installed in the next few days throughout the bilge, about 3 or 4 tons finishing\
  \ up as a small mountain in the middle of the fish hold.\n\n\n\n> The following\
  \ year, Colin added a topmast and ‘Telegraph’ took part in several events, including\
  \ the Colne Match that year. In \"Yachts & Yachting\" Robert Simper wrote \"A squall\
  \ hit some of ‘the fleet off the Mersea shore and Telegraph’ was laid right down\"\
  \ and so she was, with the starboard spreader end ploughing a furrow through the\
  \ waves. Amazingly, she did not stop but just kept ploughing along on her side.\
  \ I suppose 38 tons took a lot of stopping. One of the crew remarked afterwards\
  \ how the mainsail had formed itself to the shape of the wave pattern.\n\n\n\n>\
  \ Colin reluctantly had to part with ‘Telegraph’ in 1986 and she finished up lying\
  \ derelict at Heybridge Basin for 9 years. All her spars were ashore, rotting in\
  \ the nettles, all the bulwarks and rails had been torn off, and some of the hatches\
  \ and covering boards, leaving her open to the weather. Some of her former crew\
  \ found her, half sunk, and were horrified at her condition and how she had deteriorated\
  \ in a few years. Eventually she was towed to Maldon by ‘Ostrea Rose’ and a second\
  \ restoration commenced. This consisted of all new covering boards, bulwarks and\
  \ rail cappings, plus 14 new stanchions forward, a new hollow 37 ft spruce boom\
  \ and running rigging.\n\n\n\n> Sailing again in 1995, visiting Shotley Classic\
  \ Boat Festival and being featured in “Classic Boat\" magazine, in all she was underway\
  \ 32 times that year and in 1996 a new topsail of some 600ft was added to the sail\
  \ wardrobe. It is hoped that in the future ‘Telegraph’ will have many a full season\
  \ of events and festivals.\n\n\n#### by Colin Swindale\r\nFirst published in the\
