full_description: "<p>The Albert Strange Association reported that Albert Strange\
  \ designed Birdie in 1898 and very soon after she was built in 1899 - 1900 the name\
  \ was changed to Dorcis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They had believed she had been gutted by\
  \ fire at Maldon c.1965. However there are pictures of her in the East Coast Race\
  \ 1965 and records of her racing in the 1964 - 1971 East Coast races.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>OGA records note her being altered to cutter in 1924 and back to yawl in 1964.\
  \ She then became a ketch, then a cutter and back to ketch. The last information\
  \ says she was lost at sea, in the Mediterranean, 1974.</p>"
