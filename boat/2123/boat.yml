    'Ruffler' reduced to £7950. Memory 19. Gregs number 2 open  boat. Exhibited at
    SBS 2000 and 2001

    Present home 15 years, 5 HP saildrive Mariner on transom. Hull professionally
    re-painter this season and mast stripped and given 12 coats of varnish. Also new
    cover. Wykeham Martin furler. Topsail, storm jib and Sobastad spinnaker. Price
    includes a Bramber road trailer.

    A much admired boat at a very fair price. Receipts for just about everything.
    She is on a deep water mooring at HISC. Age and health forces me to 'slum it' in
    my Marina berthed Benateau Oceanis 31 instead.
