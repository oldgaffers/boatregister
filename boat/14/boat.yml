full_description: '<p>Sue Evans-Avionitis sent the photo of &#39;Jubilee&#39; to the
  Gaffers Log Editor on the occasion of her father, Cecil Evans&#39; death. She wrote:
  &quot;One of Dad&#39;s fondest photographs was of his beloved boat &#39;Jubilee&#39;
  at a race off Maldon, or was it Burnham in the 70&#39;s. The race was the highlight
  of his year. Will Langton who used to help crew &#39;Jubilee&#39; with my brother
  Simon when they were teenagers is now working in Harwich for the Pilot Boats and
  he spotted &#39;Jubilee&#39; sailing up the river Stour only last summer. Ah well,
  times pass.&quot;</p>'
