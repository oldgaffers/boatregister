full_description: |-
  *Tunstall Tide* is one of the first Gaffling 4.1 hulls, being built from a hull
  only kit cut by Demon Yachts. She was built by school pupils in the North East
  under the supervision of Martin Haigh. Her intended use is to introduce school
  pupils to the joys of Gaff Rig, while the process of building the dinghy created
  an opportunity for less academically interested pupils to gain experience in
  practical skills.
