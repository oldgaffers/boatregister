full_description: "<p>Fishing Smack built by Shuttlewoods of Paglesham in 1903.</p>\n\
  <p>Length; 14 metre 10cm</p>\n<p>Breadth; 3 metre 50cm</p>\n<p>Depth; 1 metre 30cm</p>\n\
  <p>Number of crew \u2013 4</p>\n<p>Mode of fishing; dredging.</p>\n<p>Originally\
  \ she was powered by a steam engine. Tablo Pitt and his sons Charlie and Reg replaced\
  \ the steam engine by a three cylinder Lister diesel engine and today it has a four\
  \ cylinder diesel Mercedes 615.</p>\n<p>\u2018Her name was something of an anomaly\
  \ as she was actually the largest vessel to be worked from Maldon at that time.\
  \ [1946]. The catch of shrimp had to be cooked on board and then laid out in trays\
  \ to dry, so the vast expanse of deck was invaluable\u2019. From; \u2018Blackwater\
  \ Men\u2019, by A. and M. Emmett. 1992, Seax Book, Elsenham, Bishop\u2019s Stortford.</p>\n\
  <p>Previous owners registered;</p>\n<p>Smith Bros. Burnham-on-Crouch, 1904.</p>\n\
  <p>Smith Bros. Burnham-on-Crouch Ltd. Burnham, Essex. 1907.</p>\n<p>A.H. Pitt, A.J.\
  \ Pitt, C.F. Pitt, R.W. Pitt. Maldon. 1946.</p>\n<p>I bought her in 1995 in Edam,\
  \ Holland. The owners had taken the ship 25 years previously from the UK to Holland.</p>\n\
  <p>It took me 10 years to rebuild the ship. It was launched in Spakenburg in 2005.\
  \ It is currently recognised as a sailing monument.</p>\n<p>She lies in Huizenharbour\
  \ in the Netherlands and has been used for recreational and charter purposes. Because\
  \ of health problems I\u2019m looking for a buyer and I would love it if the Tiny\
  \ Mite would return to the U.K. to be sailed again.</p>"
