  Originally she was powered by a steam engine. Tablo Pitt and his sons Charlie
  and Reg replaced the steam engine by a three cylinder Lister diesel engine and
  today it has a four cylinder diesel Mercedes 615.

  ‘Her name was something of an anomaly as she was actually the largest vessel to
  be worked from Maldon at that time. [1946]. The catch of shrimp had to be cooked
  on board and then laid out in trays to dry, so the vast expanse of deck was
  invaluable’. From; ‘Blackwater Men’, by A. and M. Emmett. 1992, Seax Book,
  Elsenham, Bishop’s Stortford.

  Previous owners registered;
  Smith Bros. Burnham-on-Crouch, 1904.
  Smith Bros. Burnham-on-Crouch Ltd. Burnham, Essex. 1907.
  A.H. Pitt, A.J. Pitt, C.F. Pitt, R.W. Pitt. Maldon. 1946.

  I bought her in 1995 in Edam, Holland. The owners had taken the ship 25 years
  previously from the UK to Holland.

  It took me 10 years to rebuild the ship. It was launched in Spakenburg in 2005.
  It is currently recognised as a sailing monument.

  She lies in Huizenharbour in the Netherlands and has been used for recreational
  and charter purposes. Because of health problems I’m looking for a buyer and I
  would love it if the Tiny Mite would return to the U.K. to be sailed again.
