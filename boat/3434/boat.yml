full_description: "<p>Meander was designed and built in 1992 by R.G.Grimson for his\
  \ own use as a liveaboard.&nbsp;He sailed her across the Atlantic&nbsp;in 1993.&nbsp;Mainly\
  \ based in the Bahamas, she travelled as far south as Venezuela in S America and\
  \ as far north as Nova Scotia in Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009 the upkeep of Meander\
  \ became too much and she was sold and&nbsp;returned to the UK. Her next owner&nbsp;cruised\
  \ mainly around Scotland and&nbsp;in 2019 her new owners brought her to Port Penryn,\
  \ Bangor, north&nbsp;Wales.</p>"
