  23' gaff cutter designed and built by first owner Peter Atkins of Poole and
  launched in 1993.
full_description: |-
  Patience was built by shipwright Peter Atkins in Poole. He was a keen Old Gaffer
  racing man, who having sailed several types of gaffer decided he could design
  and build one better and faster. It took him 5 years and there is an album of
  photographs that records the whole process. Time was not of the essence and
  great care was given to the construction and the detail work.


  The boat was built using West Epoxy System and BS 1088 marine ply, with teak
  laid decks and teak and mahogany exterior fit out. The shape is very
  conventional with a long keel, straight stem, good freeboard and multichine. She
  has  a generous interior volume. She is fairly full mid-ships producing ample
  buoyancy so she stands up to her canvas.


  The chines land on a full length internal stringer and there are a number of
  heavy laminated rig frames which span across the centre-line. The bulkheads at
  the forward and after ends of the saloon are structural and epoxy bonded to the
  skin.


  Carved hanging knees either side of the doorway frame posts in the forward
  bulkhead and full ring frames in way all take the compression of the deck
  stepped mast. Laminated hanging knees on the cabin coamings in the main cabin
  and in the fore cabin in way of the forward end of the coach-roof all serve to
  stiffen that structure.


  She has a very sweet sheer rising gently aft emphasised by varnished rubbing
  strakes top and bottom of the wide sheer strake. The forward and after ends of
  the sheer strake have "badges" carved and picked out in paint against the
  varnish. The fore foot is very square giving her grip in the water and
  directional stability and the transom has a delicate tumble-home to the upper
  edges. The transom-hung rudder has a step in it allowing someone in the water to
  climb back aboard.


  Heavy galvanised steel centre-plate incorporated into the companionway step and
  stowed in the raised position within the depth of the wood keel. The plate is
  raised by a lanyard through a stainless steel pipe by the main sheet support.
  Several cast iron ballast blocks are secured in the bilge across the
  centre-line.


  A relatively large, sealed cock-pit gives space for 4 crew. The cabin entrance
  with sliding hatch and wash-boards has a sill at seat level. The deck is
  swept-laid in teak over a ply sub deck. The rig is set up with halyards led aft
  along the coach-roof deck through clutches to a top-action Harken 9 winch each
  side of the entrance hatch. Jib and staysail sheets are lead through lead blocks
  on deck tracks to jammers.


  Accommodation.- 3 berths


  Fore cabin with single berth to stbd. The feet of the berth reach forward under
  the deck chain well.


  Saloon cabin. Port and starboard settee berths. Shaped, buttoned cushions.
  Shaped bunk boards. Exposed varnished yacht sides.


  Fold down chart desk against the after bulkhead to stbd. A 2-bruner Origo spirit
  stove mounted on rails on the bulkhead over the end of the port berth slides
  across to the centre-line against the companionway steps for use.

  1) Hull repainted


  2) New mast and spars (Freelands)


  3) New standing and running rigging
