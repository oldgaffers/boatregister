full_description: "Alpha was built in 1938 by Aldous of Brightlingsea. Following a\
  \ brief service history that included minesweeping, she was set to fishing in the\
  \ Thames approaches when hostilities ceased.  \n\n<div>Originally based in Leigh\
  \ on Sea she moved to Southwold in 1993 and fished from there, also being used to\
  \ rebuild the stages on the river Blyth. The method was to maneuver steel drilling\
  \ rods into place in a vertical position then sink them into the mud by hauling\
  \ up the weight of Alpha\u2019s stern using her net winch! This is how many of the\
  \ local stages became pontoons. Although the new structures extended further into\
  \ the river, they afforded safer conditions for both boats and owners. All was well\
  \ until the Alpha needed a refit. Her planking was getting pretty tired, not least\
  \ because of the owner's unconventional method of pile driving.</div>\n\n<div>Lacking\
  \ money for the boatyard repairs the Alpha was re-launched (leaking) without a deck\
  \ house and without even covering boards for the deck! She got as far as the River\
  \ Deben, where she sat on a mud berth before eventually springing a plank and sinking.\
  \  \n</div>\n\n<div>In 2020 she was lying on a horse shoal, a little downstream\
  \ from Melton road-bridge, kept afloat at high tide by large plastic containers\
  \ inside her.  \n</div>"
