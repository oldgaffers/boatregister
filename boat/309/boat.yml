full_description: "Built in Norway of a. true Colin Archer type as a half decked ship's\
  \ boat.  It is believed she was bought to England on the deck of a steamer.  She\
  \ had two owners in England until 1953 when she was bought by Mr. Young\u2019s father.\
  \  She was then gunter rigged with a very small sail plan which Mr Young replaced\
  \ and later added a lead keel in place of the internal ballast.  She finished second\
  \ in the East Coast Old Gaffers Race and was Class 3 winner of 1965.  In 1968 a\
  \ cabin top was fitted and in the 1971 race she finished first overall on corrected\
  \ time the Stone Trophy."
