full_description: '<p><em>Asti V</em> is an International 6 metre designed by Morgan
  Giles for the Spanish royal family to race in the 1932 Olympics. Built in 1930 in
  Bilboa at the yard of Hermano Sagredo by men transported over specially from Morgan
  Giles in England. She is constructed of Mahogany &nbsp;on steamed oak frames. She
  was smuggled out of Spain as deck cargo to Maldon during the Spanish Civil War,
  and renamed <em>Saxon</em> in 1934. Originally sporting 3 open cockpits for crew,
  over the years the rig was altered and a large cabin built for family cruising by
  various owners. Under the name of <em>Saxon</em> she sailed at Burnham and with
  the Maldon Little Ship club.</p>

  <p><em>Saxon</em> was acquired in 1984 by Hartley and Brookes Boat Designs of Heybridge
  Basin, Maldon. They restored her original name, gutted the hull and removed the
  rig. A new rig and deck layout was designed by Colin Brookes with the work being
  carried out by Peter Brookes through the winter of 1984-5.</p>

  <p>She was sold out of the OGA in 2003.</p>'
