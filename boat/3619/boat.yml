  "Shoreham-by-Sea"), [West Sussex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Sussex
  "West Sussex") in England and has previously carried the names *Betty*,
  *Alciope*, and *Escape*. In 2017, the Albert Strange Association, then owners of
  the boat, sold it to an English boatbuilder (Leo Sampson Goolden) to be
  completely refit. Leo has completed the restoration, just launched Tally Ho, and
  is looking forward to his first cruise.
