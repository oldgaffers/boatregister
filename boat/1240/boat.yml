short_description: <p>&#39;Little Kingfisher&#39; was kept in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight
  after the 2nd World War when she returned from her longest voyage, to the Baltic.</p>
full_description: "<p>Built by A H Watty of Fowey as &#39;Kingfisher&#39; a 21ft Cyclone\
  \ designed by Dr T Harrison Butler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archive material held by the owner\
  \ includes two letters written by Harrison Butler in 1935, commenting on the change\
  \ of rig from gaff to Bermudan and on her sail balance. She was built using oak\
  \ frames with grown elbows, her planking and decks were teak and she was copper\
  \ fastened. In 1935, she was fitted with a Stuart Turner 6 horse power petrol two\
  \ cylinder two-stroke engine with reverse gear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has a small cockpit\
  \ and her cabin is entered by a hatch with an oilskin locker to port and a small\
  \ pocket galley to starboard. She has two settee berths and a half-bulkhead to the\
  \ forepeak stowage area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her lifetime, &#39;Little Kingfisher&#39;\
  \ has cruised extensively over most of the English Channel and North Sea, from Poole\
  \ to Aldeburgh and Cherbourg to the Elbe. Her voyages include Chichester to Holland,\
  \ Svenborg, Gotenburg, Stockholm, and Helskinki where she spent the war, being shipped\
  \ home in June 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1970s, she was hit by a ship while\
  \ moored at Pin Mill and, although repairable, was written off. She was subsequently\
  \ bought from the insurance company and structural repairs were carried out.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Between 1994 and 2009, major restoration works were undertaken by Paul\
  \ Drake at Tollesbury and in 2000, a 10hp Yanmar single cylinder diesel engine was\
  \ fitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When purchased in 2010, &#39;Little Kingfisher&#39; was\
  \ found in a barn near Falmouth, Cornwall and shipped back to the South Coast by\
  \ road to her new base on the Hamble River. She has sailed regularly around the\
  \ Solent and at OGA events, before being sold in 2017.</p>"
