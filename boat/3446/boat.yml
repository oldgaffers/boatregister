full_description: "<p>&#39;Julietta&#39; was built in either 1957 or 1959 by Fairey\
  \ Marine on the river Hamble.&nbsp; The timber used in her construction is an African\
  \ hardwood known as Nigerian Cedar, or Agba. Full production of Atalanta started\
  \ in 1955 and about 200 were built, with profuction ceasing in the late 1960s</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She was discovered by her current owner and a friend in 2007 in a field\
  \ in Cambridgeshire. They were towing her down to Cardiff with a vintage landrover\
  \ when the landrover engine blew out on the M4 and &#39;Julietta&#39; finished the\
  \ trip under tow from the AA. She was in a poor state, with holes in the deck and\
  \ hull sue to&nbsp;a lot of rot, and delamination of the plywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\
  \ repair work took much longer than anticipated and was not completed until 2017,\
  \ when &#39;Julietta&#39; was put in the water. Unfortunately the stern tube leaked\
  \ and she was recovered onto the hard. She stayed there until mid&nbsp;2018 when\
  \ it was noticed that the mast was rotten. The old mast was removed&nbsp;and&nbsp;a\
  \ new aluminium mast was sourced and adapted. It was not stepped immediately as\
  \ the owner decided to investigate converting &#39;Julietta&#39; to a gunter rig.\
  \ This has been done to at least one other Atalanta&nbsp;to enable it&nbsp;to cruise\
  \ the Netherlands canals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coventry Victor 8hp petrol engine was\
  \ beyong repair and has been replaced with a 15hp Kabuta which has been&nbsp;marinised&nbsp;and\
  \ adaptated&nbsp;to drive the variable prop gearbox. Not an easy task.</p>"
