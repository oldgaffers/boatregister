full_description: "<h3>1988 Crouch Rally Report when &#39;Noorderzon&#39; won the\
  \ Ind Coope &amp; Allsopp Old Gaffers Trophy</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>first published in\
  \ the OGA Newsletter, 1988/2</h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A somewhat anxious race committee\
  \ noted the wind was not easing as forecast, but increasing, the anemometer reading\
  \ 30 knots and over. Thus a shortened course was ordered, and a delayed start arranged\
  \ - we wanted to digest Sunday lunch befor facing that lot! Staggered starts were\
  \ arranged, the slower boats off first, speedier gaffers like &#39;Chittabob IV&#39;\
  \ an hour later.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Trememdous speeds were made down\
  \ to the Couch entrance but with the wind gusting to Force 7, some of us wished\
  \ we had tucked two reefs in instead of one! Of the twenty boats racing we had five\
  \ retirements, but no damage done. The southwesterly wind gave long legs up the\
  \ river on the beat back, enabling some pretty smart windward sailing along lee\
  \ shores to take place. Big boats like &#39;Noordezon&#39; and &#39;Gracie&#39;\
  \ really lapped up the weather, but the dart like race &#39;Elaine&#39;, setting&nbsp;\
  \ self-tacking foresail on a boom yankee style also went well, as did the little\
  \ &#39;Pelican&#39; setting a mainsail off the champion gaffer &#39;Jade&#39;.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>As the fleet raced up the Crouch, low water spring tides laid\
  \ snares for the unwary - &#39;Deva&#39;, having eased the sides of the channel\
  \ twice previously grounded a third time unlucky within sight of the finish. Which\
  \ makes &#39;Norderzon&#39;s&#39; victory all the more notewothy, with her deep\
  \ draft. Cretainly she was a magnificane sight for us as she ploughed upriver, and\
  \ a magnificent boat for the day.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>28 September 1996 Maldon\
  \ OGA Anniversary Rally &amp; Town Regatta when &#39;Hardy&#39; took line honours\
  \ and the Bright Trophy, ahead of &#39;Noorderzon&#39; and &#39;Spellbound&#39;</h3>\r\
  \n\r\n<h4>first published in the OGA Gaffers Log, March 1997</h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It\
  \ was blowing fresh from the west with a gale on its way. Even so there was still\
  \ a substantial fleet of great interest. In the cruisers we had craft ranging from\
  \ under 20 ft. such as the yole &#39;Hequend&#39;, to the mighty steel &#39;Noorderzon&#39;,\
  \ a pilot cutter with Fastnet tendencies! Classic yachts range from the French 7.5\
  \ metre &#39;Sheena&#39; and the ECOD &#39;Chittabob&#39; to the magnificent 50\
  \ ft. Summers &amp; Payne &#39;Hardy&#39;. Smacks were of course well represented,\
  \ as the race was also the traditional Town Regatta course of 1952.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>The first part of the course was out to Mersea Mo. 1 buoy before\
  \ cutting across to the Bradwell shore and up the river. The downwind start gave\
  \ a fairly congested rounding of the leeward mark, befor the slog up the river.\
  \ The wind over tide made it hearv going for the little vessels and all the smacks\
  \ were having to reef once if not twice. Because the big boats were so early on\
  \ the tide, additional legs had to be inserted in the course for the tide to make\
  \ sufficiently at Hythe Quay. Stansgate Narrows in a small boat is nasty enough\
  \ to go through once in fresh winds, and four times was too much for some. Great\
  \ skills were needed for the big boats too, as they beat up the narrow channel through\
  \ th moornigns to finish in front of the spectators lining Hythe Quay at Maldon.\
  \ Great skill was needed too, to hand sail in that wind before the bridge was breached!</blockquote>"
