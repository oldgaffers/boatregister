short_description: Eleni is styled after a traditional Greek trehantiri
full_description: |-
  Eleni is a traditional Greek boat called a τρεχαντήρι (trehantiri). These are a
  very common sight in Greece, making up a good percentage of the small boat
  fishing fleet there. However, Eleni is a real rarity in that she was built
  explicitly as a sailing boat, unlike today's working τρεχαντήρια, which are all
  motorboats.


  She was built over the course of 7 years by amateur boat-builder Hans-Henrik
  Jørgensen in the north of Denmark, and launched in 2001. Hans-Henrik had a
  passion for Greek boats and based his design on a sponge-fishing boat built
  around 1930 but, in consultation with Kostas Damianidis, adapted the design to
  make it more suitable as a pure sailing boat.


  Eleni's working boat forbears would have had little or no accommodation to copy
  from, so hers is much more in the Danish tradition than Greek - and none the
  worse for that! Below, she has a pilot berth beneath a lifting chart table plus
  a saloon berth to starboard, galley with Wallas stove, double seat and Blake
  head to port, and a double v-berth forward.


  Between 2016 and 2018 Eleni was berthed in Maldon, where she had a new gaff
  cutter rig installed by TS Rigging, with sails by Jim Lawrence. A new Beta 50HP
  was also installed to replace a very elderly Perkins, along with various other
  improvements.


  In 2018 Eleni made her second voyage to Greece, and currently lives in Preveza
  in the Ionian, where she feels very much at home.
