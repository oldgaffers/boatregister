full_description: "Eleni is a traditional Greek boat called a \u03C4\u03C1\u03B5\u03C7\
  \u03B1\u03BD\u03C4\u03AE\u03C1\u03B9 (trehantiri). These are a\nvery common sight\
  \ in Greece, making up a good percentage of the small boat\nfishing fleet there.\
  \ However, Eleni is a real rarity in that she was built\nexplicitly as a sailing\
  \ boat, unlike today's working \u03C4\u03C1\u03B5\u03C7\u03B1\u03BD\u03C4\u03AE\u03C1\
  \u03B9\u03B1, which are all\nmotorboats.\n\n\n\nShe was built over the course of\
  \ 7 years by amateur boat-builder Hans-Henrik\nJ\xF8rgensen in the north of Denmark,\
  \ and launched in 2001. Hans-Henrik had a\npassion for Greek boats and based his\
  \ design on a sponge-fishing boat built\naround 1930 but, in consultation with Kostas\
  \ Damianidis, adapted the design to\nmake it more suitable as a pure sailing boat.\n\
  \n\n\nEleni's working boat forbears would have had little or no accommodation to\
  \ copy\nfrom, so hers is much more in the Danish tradition than Greek - and none\
  \ the\nworse for that! Below, she has a pilot berth beneath a lifting chart table\
  \ plus\na saloon berth to starboard, galley with Wallas stove, double seat and Blake\n\
  head to port, and a double v-berth forward.\n\n\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018 Eleni was\
  \ berthed in Maldon, where she had a new gaff\ncutter rig installed by TS Rigging,\
  \ with sails by Jim Lawrence. A new Beta 50HP\nwas also installed to replace a very\
  \ elderly Perkins, along with various other\nimprovements.\n\n\n\nIn 2018 Eleni\
  \ made her second voyage to Greece, and currently lives in Preveza\nin the Ionian,\
  \ where she feels very much at home.\n\n\n"
