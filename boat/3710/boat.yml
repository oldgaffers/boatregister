full_description: "<p>Eleni is a traditional Greek boat called a \u03C4\u03C1\u03B5\
  \u03C7\u03B1\u03BD\u03C4\u03AE\u03C1\u03B9 (trehantiri). These are a very common\
  \ sight in Greece, making up a good percentage of the small boat fishing fleet there.\
  \ However, Eleni is a real rarity in that she was built explicitly as a sailing\
  \ boat, unlike today's working \u03C4\u03C1\u03B5\u03C7\u03B1\u03BD\u03C4\u03AE\u03C1\
  \u03B9\u03B1, which are all motorboats.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>She was built over\
  \ the course of 7 years by amateur boat-builder Hans-Henrik J\xF8rgensen in the\
  \ north of Denmark, and launched in 2001. Hans-Henrik had a passion for Greek boats\
  \ and based his design on a sponge-fishing boat built around 1930 but, in consultation\
  \ with Kostas Damianidis, adapted the design to make it more suitable as a pure\
  \ sailing boat.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Eleni's working boat forbears would have had\
  \ little or no accommodation to copy from, so hers is much more in the Danish tradition\
  \ than Greek - and none the worse for that! Below, she has a pilot berth beneath\
  \ a lifting chart table plus a saloon berth to starboard, galley with Wallas stove,\
  \ double seat and Blake head to port, and a double v-berth forward.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\
  <p>Between 2016 and 2018 Eleni was berthed in Maldon, where she had a new gaff cutter\
  \ rig installed by TS Rigging, with sails by Jim Lawrence. A new Beta 50HP was also\
  \ installed to replace a very elderly Perkins, along with various other improvements.</p>\n\
  <p><br></p>\n<p>In 2018 Eleni made her second voyage to Greece, and currently lives\
  \ in Preveza in the Ionian, where she feels very much at home.</p>\n<p><br></p>"
