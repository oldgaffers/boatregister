full_description: |-
  Tannhauser is a ketch rigged German racing cruiser built in the early 1960s to a
  1959 design (according to the rigging plan, which is annotated in French). The
  designer and builder are currently unknown, but historic surveys state the hull
  was built in Ghana then shipped to Germany for fitting out, completed c.1963.
  Hull construction is exactly to Lloyds A1 standard for wood construction
  fastened with copper, and was built to exacting tolerances with very fine seams
  and seam savers on the inside seams (rebated into the iroko frames). The
  centreboard runs most of the length of the keel, and is an iroko blade with a
  stainless steel internal cover. The centreboard is raised an lowered by hand
  winch from the cockpit. Draft with centreboard down increases to 8 feet. The
  interior reflects the high standards of finish and attention to detail prevalent
  in German yards of the period. She has undergone several refits and
  refurbishments, including having the original engine replaced with a Bukh 36,
  which now occupies what would have been a small stern cabin, replacement of the
  teak deck in the 2000s, some hull replanking and main mast rebuilding in 2022.
  Currently in the final phases of renewing brightwork and detail repairs.
