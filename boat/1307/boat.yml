  \ lugger and fished from St Ives until 1954 when she was sold as a yacht. Her working\
  \ year began in March, fishing for mackerel, sometimes as far west as the Isles\
  \ of Scilly. In midsummer she switched to herring in the Irish Sea, often fishing\
  \ off Howth, near Dublin. Her crew of five men and a boy all ate and slept in the\
  \ cramped foc&rsquo;sle. The drift nets were shot at night.</p>"
