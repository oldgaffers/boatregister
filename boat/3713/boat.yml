    *White Nancy* is the cruising version of the Falmouth Working boat, a powerful
    traditional rig and capable hull form which makes for a superb sea boat.


    This one was built by Martin Heard himself, lovingly maintained, her third owner
    regretfully offers for sale after extensive voyaging. This boat has crossed the
    Atlantic and equator twice solo.


    She would suit those that appreciate the timeless solid build with none of the
    concessions to cost sadly apparent in more modern boats.
