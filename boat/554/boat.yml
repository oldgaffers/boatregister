short_description: <p>Rebuilt by Paddy Barry 1974-79 and extensively cruised, &#39;Saint
  Patrick&#39; was lost on 21 May 2002 when she broke from her mooring in Glandore
  Bay.</p>
full_description: "<p>Paddy Barry recounts the history of &#39;Saint Patrick&#39;
  and the Galway hookers in an article first published in the OGA Newsletter, 1985
  when he had owned her for 12 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When the Royal Cornwall
  Yacht Club hoisted the Irish tricolour to their yard-arm one afternoon in August
  1981 &lsquo;Saint Patrick&rsquo; was being welcomed in a very different way to that
  in which she was brought up. This lady was the pride of the small boats working
  cargo in the rugged Galway Bay area of Ireland&rsquo;s west coast for over 50 years.</blockquote>\r
  \n\r\n<blockquote>She had started in 1909 as a purpose built cargo boat to carry
  12 to 15 tons under sail. Now the same functionalism and breeding serves her well
  as a sailing cruiser. She goes in for the odd race and she responds to hard driving.
  She won the All Ireland Hooker Championship in 1980 and also entered the Kinvarra
  Regatta. The Championship event is no stately parade of clapped out vintage craft.
  About a dozen of these 38&rsquo; or so working boats line up for this race each
  July to honour St. Macdara, the local boatman&#39;s Saint. The Good Saint would
  be flattered at the area of canvas carried, the underwater rocks surefootedly passed
  and the general vigour which goes into this yearly remembrance. Gaelic was and still
  is the language spoken in the area.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Before the lorries
  came out the newly built roads of Galway&#39;s Connemara district, boats were the
  lifeblood of this community. The land was deeply indented by bays. Offshore islands
  abounded. Some of these were linked by bridge or causeway to the mainland. Others
  like the Aran Islands, 12 miles out into the Atlantic, were accessible only in good
  weather. The City of Galway lay some 40 miles to the East. Goods and people travelled
  universally by boat. Canvas currachs and rowing boats worked locally. Middle sized
  Dipping Lug Pucans and Gleoteogs in the 20&rsquo; to 30&rsquo; size range carried
  3 to 5 tons. The Hookers or &lsquo;Bad Mor&rsquo; (Big Boat) of length 35-40&rsquo;
  and capacity 1 to15 tons were the equivalent of the 40&rsquo; articulated lorries
  that go the roads today. They were to be found everywhere. To see 100 of the black
  sails in the Bay was not unusual. In their open holds they carried sheep, pigs and
  cattle to Market in Galway. They carried ground meal, paraffin oil, timber and iron
  out to Connemara. They carried peat to the Aran Islands, for these are so bereft
  of soil that neither peat nor firewood is to be found there. They carried seaweed
  for fertilising the land and then carried the potatoes that grew on it.</blockquote>\r
  \n\r\n<blockquote>They were hard times in a land that required constant struggle
  to eke out a subsistence living. It remained so with little change right through
  the 19th century up to the mid 1940s. The island of Mweenish is linked by a rocky
  causeway to mainland Connemara. The Casey family of Mweenish were renowned as builders
  of fine boats. In 1909 Pat and Joe laid the keel of the Saint Patrick in the field
  behind their house overlooking the sea. Their younger sister Brid, remembers construction
  as being intermittent. They were building her for the use of their own family who
  had a shop on the island. She was launched in 1911 and immediately established herself.
  She was reputed to be the only boat that could round &lsquo;Ceann Boirne&rsquo;
  in a gale.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Although drawing only 5&rsquo;6&quot;
  she proved exceptionally weatherly of her type. The lines drawing shows a fine underwater
  entry that belies her heavy topside appearance. Strong bilges give good carrying
  capacity and stability. The long lean run aft makes for a clean exit. The tumblehome
  served to give added structural strength and protection to the cargo. Because she
  was not a fishing boat the loss of deck space consequent on tumblehome was not missed.
  The tumblehome also served to keep the gunwales out of the water when heeled. The
  sheer rises sharply to deal with the big Atlantic seas. Decked aft to the mast only,
  her cargo space amidships was open. A false stem of some 9&rdquo; makes for a tine
  entry. The transom rakes sharply. While this undoubtedly allows the seas to run
  harmlessly under her it must contribute to the very heavy helm.</blockquote>\r\n
  \r\n<blockquote>Construction is larch on grown oak frames. Shelving and transverse
  mast beam and sailing beam are from slabs of oak. The keel is 30&rsquo; long. All
  fittings are wrought iron. The dumps which hold the structural members are typically
  three-quarter inch and the nails are believed to come from Scotland. Chainplates
  and rigging ironwork would have been made by the local blacksmiths. A pair of 19&rsquo;
  sweeps provided propulsion in calms.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>These boats
  were built without drawings. But by no means were they built without figures. Templates
  from previous craft would have been retained so that alterations of shape or size
  would have been by reference to previous models and performance. Caulking was oakum.
  Black tar provided the finishing treatment. The rig was standard western European
  cutter of the 19th century as it had developed in its later stages. A high peaked
  gaff mainsail was loose-footed on the boom and held by lacing to the mast. Two headsails,
  the foremost of which was run out on an unstayed bowsprit, complemented the mainsail.
  All were of calico or flax proofed, cut and made up locally. Indeed one of the many
  mistakes made by the writer was to copy the size of the sails that were with the
  boat when I bought her in 1973. Terelene sails in dark tan were made up only to
  find that they were too small. Apparently a previous &lsquo;yachtsman&rsquo; owner
  had the working sails cut down! Simplicity is the essence of the rig. The 40&rsquo;
  mast is 10&quot; diameter at deck level and is stayed singly&#39; on either side.
  As a concession to our timidity we have doubled up on this. Interestingly on the
  two occasions that shrouds parted under stress of weather the mast held up. The
  general easy motion and elasticity of the rig and the fact that ballast is carried
  internally would have helped in this regard. Four part throat and three part peak
  halyards combine with two p&#39;art topping lift to carry the 750 sq. ft. mainsaIl.
  We have learned over the years that muscle power is no substitute for knack and
  knowhow In handling. The gear is very heavy by modern standards. The four-part mainsheet
  was handled by the helmsman who steered as often as not by sitting with his back
  to the tiller.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The Casey family sold the &lsquo;St.
  Patrick&rsquo; after a short number of years to the Cannery family of Rosmuc. The
  Connerys were prosperous by pre-yachting standards. They ran a general store and
  had two boats. The boat became known, and is still known colloquially as &lsquo;Ilad
  Conaire&rsquo; (Conney&#39;s Boat). This same family produced the writer Paraic
  0&rsquo; Conaire whose statue is in Eyre Square, Galway.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>All
  hookers carried fire. An open stone hearth with sides raised only a few inches was
  located in the living quarters under the foredeck. The smoke rose through the forehatch.
  Peat or turf was the fuel. Tea, fish and potatoes were the fare. Summer and winter
  untIl about 1950 she did a weekly run to Galway. Often the goods on arrival in Rosmuc
  would not touch the quay but would be loaded directly onto smaller boats. In winter
  the crew of two were often weatherbound for weeks at a time away from home. Then
  the lorries took over. She was sold to the turf trade in Carraroe where she served
  the last ten years of her working life bringing fuel to Aran.</blockquote>\r\n\r
  \n<blockquote>About 1962 a group of five enthusiasts bought her, fitted her, decked,
  engined and yachted her out but this was not to be very successful and five years
  later she was sold to a sIngle owner in West Cork. Again this was not a success
  as she was found to be too much of a handful with her unreliable engine, insufficient
  crew and the owner&#39;s inexperience in handling the type of craft. And that is
  where, in 1973, yours truly came in.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For several
  years a feature of my holidays in West Cork had been a visit to see the old Hooker.
  Every year more neglected, but always an evocative sight. She was however not tor
  sale and changed hands only after my good intentions, assurances, character references
  and such like prevailed. All next season we sailed and bailed with more bailing
  than sailing. A liferaft was put aboard. We stitched and tore those flax and calico
  sails and patched them. My unhappiest memories of that summer are of being laid
  out on the foredeck with palm and needle attending alternately to the jib clew and
  to getting last night&#39;s supper over the side. We were engineless and carried
  by way of cargo one hand pump and several buckets and some sundry light machinery
  in the line of a 2&rdquo; diesel Lister pump and a 3&rdquo; spare pump. Neither
  pump worked reliably because of priming problems. At season&#39;s end the vague
  plans for &lsquo;some&rsquo; repairs were urgently brought forward. The steel Acrow
  props and railway sleepers providing jury support to the mast et al as they were
  removed and the good ship landed into my suburban Dublin back garden. There she
  stood for five years while old stuff was sledged and cut out and a forest of larch
  and oak was consumed in a substantial rebuild.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Perkins
  4236 engine and tan tereylene sails went aboard to make her move. Mind you for two
  of those five years I was in Malawi in the line of duty which also helped to restore
  order to the bank balance. Afloat in pristine splendour in 1979 we went south about
  to and from the traditional Regattas in Connemara. Insufficient canvas slowed us.
  The &lsquo;Fastnet Gale&rsquo; found us anchored in Brandon Bay, Kerry on passage
  home. The ground tackle held but the three of us were swamped in the dinghy while
  going ashore about 10pm in the gathering darkness and rising gale. Luckily we were
  lifejacketed and made the shore. The dingy was wrecked.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1980
  saw us round Ireland under new canvas, taking in the Connemara Regattas more successfully
  this time. We naturally diverted to Port Patrick on Scotland&#39;s adjacent shore
  to pay our respects. 1981 feeling that the running in period was over we cruised
  Biscay to Northern Spain, with family link ups, returning by way of Brittany and
  Cornwall. A feature of this cruise was the low motoring/sailing ratio caused by
  fuel pollution problems. However our perspective on the old sailing ways and life
  in general broadened considerably! 1982 back to Connemara again rounding Ireland.
  The return passage to Dublin north about proved hard going having to run for shelter
  on two of the three weekends involved. She featured on an Irish Postage Stamp this
  year. 1983 for a change of scene and weather back to Brittany, with family link
  ups. Con McCann&rsquo;s &lsquo;Contact&rsquo;, the oldest remaining Galway Hooker
  was in company with us intermittently! The weather as everywhere was glorious. Basing
  ourselves in Douarnenez and Concaneau the best of Breton hospitality was enjoyed.
  We were treated royally by Bernard Cadoret and friends of the &lsquo;Chasse Maree&rsquo;
  Magazine. Their book on French Working sailboats &lsquo;Ar Vag&rsquo; in two volumes,
  is a delight. Jean-Jacques Guillou of the Societe Nautique de la Baie De Concarneau
  was responsible for a fine time had by all there. We made sail by the quayside in
  Camaret and heard later that Parisiennes on holiday were delighted to see a real
  &lsquo;Breton Boat&rsquo;.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>While one is never likely
  to grow soft on the &lsquo;Saint Patrick&rsquo; the scene below decks has now become
  almost civilised. Five pipecots are tucked under the sidedecks for the lie down.
  A coal stove for the heat and a robust table, 5&rsquo; x 3&rsquo; for the chartwork
  and dining predominate. Gascooking, bucket loo (black bucket for the gents, white
  bucket for the ladies) and a stereo music system. Navigation is by trailing log,
  grid compass and ebbeo sextant with back up of seafarer echo sounder, ROF and VHF.
  A topside centre lifeline from stem to cockpit provides hook on for safety harness.
  Navigation lights are electric and a radar reflector is sent up as required. The
  9&rsquo; dinghy is carried upside down aft of the coachroof. Normal ground tackle
  is a 60 lb. COR with 30 fathom of 7/16 chain running over a stemmed roller with
  pawl. A foredeck which is rarely used except for kedging. Back up ground tackle
  is fisherman anchors 90lb., 72lb. and 35 lb. with 15 fathom 7/16 chain and 50 fathom
  of 2.5&rdquo; nylon warp.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Our biggest problem is
  getting to windward in rough seas. Without some engine help open sea passages close
  hauled are tedious. The other major problem is reefing. The boom projects 4&rsquo;
  outboard. Such arrangements as we have tried so far for slab reefing are unsatisfactory
  but I have no doubt that this is not insoluble. And for 1984 and beyond who knows?
  The Cabaret Pors Beach festival in August has a nice ring to it.</blockquote>\r\n
