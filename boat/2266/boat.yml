full_description: "<p>&lsquo;Muriel&rsquo;, built in 1905 of pitch pine on oak was\
  \ &lsquo;rebuilt&rsquo; twice under the ownership of Paul and his wife Pat. In the\
  \ 1970s she was converted into a Bermudan cutter with large coachroof for safe sailing\
  \ with their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1990s she was re-fastened, re-decked\
  \ and re-rigged as a gaff cutter with large sail area. She did however stay faithful\
  \ to Paul&rsquo;s choice of colour, red. Paul was a a member of the OGA for over\
  \ 30 years&nbsp;and he regularly entered in the Start Bay&nbsp;Race and Dartmouth\
  \ Regatta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, &#39;Muriel&#39; was relaunched following another\
  \ restoration. After the passing of his parents in 2016, Jonathan and Penny Heighway\
  \ took her on and she underwent a thorough refit, including a new hollow mast and\
  \ running rigging. To reflect the next stage of her life, &#39;Muriel&#39; has been\
  \ painted white and will continue to sail with the South West Gaffers.</p>"
