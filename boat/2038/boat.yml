    *Naiad* has belonged to us for 40 years. She was built in the 1930s by Eversons
    boatyard in Woodbridge. I believe that about 30 were built and Naiad is one of
    very few remaining. She has been used for sailing the Stour estuary with all our
    family and was stored in a barn at home during the winter.   When we first owned
    her I gave her a new top strake and a marine ply deck covered with a layer of
    glassfibre cloth which has lasted well with no problems. The International Boat
    Building Training College in Lowestoft replaced various planks and frames about
    ten years ago.


    She was on her mooring at Manningtree each summer until two years ago, with a
    new Elite cover protecting her brightwork from the elements.   *Naiad* has a
    galvanised iron centreplate and a short bowsprit. Her jib is furled using an
    original Wykeham Martin furling system. She is gunter rigged.   *Naiad* is for
    sale to a good home for just Â£1,200.
