full_description: |-
  The Morbic 12 is a 12 foot dinghy designed by French naval architect Francois
  Vivier with home construction in mind. Its design has echoes of the
  International 12 foot Olympic class of 1920 combined with the lines of
  traditional Breton fishing boats.

  *Aura* was a ‘lockdown project’ and is one of over 170 worldwide of which there
  are more than 18 in the UK. *Aura i*s built from okume marine ply strakes with
  sapele gunwales and other details. The spars are of sitka spruce with sail by
  Jeckells of Wroxham.

  She has been trailer-sailed around the UK including at: Chichester harbour,
  reservoirs at Durleigh and Llyn Clywedog, the Rivers Thames, Dart and Beaulieu
  and the Milford Haven.

  Being light, enjoyable and forgiving to sail she has proved popular with
  enthusiastic and hesitant crews alike.
