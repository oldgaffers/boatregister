full_description: |-
  Built by Saunders & Co. on the River Dart in 1924, for skipper William Pillar,
  'Provident' is a medium sized Mule class gaff ketch and fished 'with three men
  and a boy'. After only six years fishing, an American, Captain RH Lagarde,
  purchased her for conversion to a yacht using Morgan Giles design.


  Remaining in the West Country up to and during the Second World War, she
  continued cruising, including the Baltic ports and had an engine fitted. Since
  1951 her sailing career continued as a charter vessel with restoration and refit
  programmes undertaken in 1986 - 1991 and 2013 - 2014. A new engine was installed
  in 2016.


  She was owned by the Trinity Sailing Foundation and provided adventure and sail
  training to the public, including youth and disadvantaged groups. She had taken
  part in OGA events in the South West and Solent as well as several of the major
  French festivals.


  She is now owned by Provident Sailing since 2022 and is available for private
  charter.
