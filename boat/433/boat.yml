full_description: "<p>Built by Saunders &amp; Co. on the River Dart in 1924, for skipper\
  \ William Pillar, &#39;Provident&#39; is a medium sized Mule class gaff ketch and\
  \ fished &#39;with three men and a boy&#39;. After only six years fishing, an American,\
  \ Captain RH Lagarde, purchased her for conversion to a yacht using Morgan Giles\
  \ design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remaining in the West Country up to and during the Second\
  \ World War, she continued cruising, including the Baltic ports and had an engine\
  \ fitted. Since 1951 her sailing career continued as a charter vessel with restoration\
  \ and refit programmes undertaken in 1986 - 1991 and 2013 - 2014. A new engine was\
  \ installed in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owned by the Trinity Sailing Foundation since\
  \ 2002, &#39;Provident&#39; provides adventure and sail training to the public,\
  \ including youth and disadvantaged groups. She has taken part in OGA events in\
  \ the South West and Solent as well as several of the major French festivals.</p>\r\
