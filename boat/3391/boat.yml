    \ style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The\
    \ Cornish Yawl was designed by Roger Dongray and 45 of these lovely craft were\
    \ built at Rock in North Cornwall between 1988 and 1994 as successors to the Cornish\
    \ Crabber Mark 1 and 2.&nbsp; GLORY is sail number 12 (CY12) and I have owned\
    \ her since 2013.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span\

    >When I found her she was ashore on her own yard cradle near Woodbridge and had\
    \ obviously been out of the water for some time.&nbsp; There have been four previous\
    \ owners, the original purchaser being a previous director of Barrus.&nbsp; He\
    \ was able to import an example of the freshwater cooled 2 cylinder Yanmar (2GM20F)\
    \ which he had Crabbers install in Glory.&nbsp; Glory Farm was the original owner\u2019\
    s address, which accounts for the boat\u2019s name.</span></span></span></p><p\
    \ style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"\
    line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">General specifications\
    \ and layout are shown below and Glory conforms pretty well to the internal layout\
    \ shown.&nbsp; There is a quarter berth on the starboard side, two settee berths\
    \ either side of the saloon table and an optional &ldquo;V-berth\" at waist height\
    \ forward.&nbsp; A Jabsco marine toilet compartment and gas cooker are to port\
    \ with a navigation station and sink to starboard.&nbsp; Realistically I find\
    \ the V berth is best used for luggage and the quarter berth for athletic crew\
    \ or stores.&nbsp; With standing headroom (at least in the after part of the cabin)\
    \ the yawl makes a lovely home for two people for a long weekend or a week\u2019\
    s cruising.&nbsp; Beaching legs allow her to take the ground.</span></span></span></p><p\
    \ style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"\
    line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">A major part\
    \ of the attraction of the yawl for me was the fact that all the controls come\
    \ back into the cockpit, so even if you\u2019re new to the gaff set up it\u2019\
    s very simple and safe to operate.&nbsp; The lifting keel is operated by an electric\
    \ winch which can be controlled from the cockpit.&nbsp; The sail plan is also\
    \ very user friendly with slab reefing of the main and roller furling headsail.&nbsp;\
    \ The yawl sails nicely on mizzen and headsail alone if required.</span></span></span></p><p\
    \ style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"\
    line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Since acquiring\
    \ Glory I\u2019ve had the electrics pretty much renewed throughout, replaced the\
    \ mast, the keel pivot bolt, the keel lifting wire, the rudder post bearing, the\
    \ rudder mounting bolts, the sagging headlining, re-galvanised the lifting keel,\
    \ fitted two new batteries, an ensign crane on the mizzen, serviced the automatic\
    \ bilge pump, had the hull professionally copper coated, replaced all the valves\
    \ and springs in the Jabsco toilet and freshwater water pump and replaced the\
    \ leaky flexible water tank with a new one.&nbsp; Regular service items such as\
    \ replacing anodes and engine oil etc have been done as necessary, the standing\
    \ rigging was checked and passed in 2017 and running rigging has been replaced\
    \ as needed.&nbsp; When the new Collars mast was installed by Nick Gates in 2018\
    \ I went with his recommendation to modify the design slightly to remove the &ldquo;through\
    \ mast\" crosstree which was a permanent source of leaks into the timber, and\
    \ fitted the mast band onto a ledge created in the mast itself.&nbsp; That should\
    \ remove an annoying design &ldquo;feature\" whereby the cross tree movement makes\
    \ a watertight seal almost impossible.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm\

    \ style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 2017 I ordered a custom made boat\
    \ cover which extends from mizzen up to the main mast to give some overwinter\
    \ protection to the majority of the hull whether ashore or afloat.</span></span></span></p><p\
    \ style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"\
    line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In the electronics\
    \ and navigation department I\u2019ve fitted a Standard Horizon CP300 chart plotter\
    \ and GX2000 DSC VHF.&nbsp; This set up will allow for future implementation of\
    \ AIS on radio or plotter if required with the addition of a simple AIS engine.&nbsp;\
    \ A NASA wind meter and Duet depth and speed log together with a Tiller Pilot\
    \ auto steering system complete the electronics set up.&nbsp; In 2018 I installed\
    \ a semi flexible 30W solar panel on the cabin roof which has kept the batteries\
    \ constantly at full charge.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm\
