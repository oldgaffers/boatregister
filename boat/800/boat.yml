full_description: "<p>Hirondelle was built in 1904 by John le Lacheur in St Peters,\
  \ Guernsey, as a yawl. The main mast was in the bow, like a catboat except she carried\
  \ a bowsprit, and a mizzen on the transom. Her hull is very similar to other contemporary\
  \ fishing boats except for the bow which has more rake and flare which was believed\
  \ to be at the suggestion of an American sailor working in the yard.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Her first owner was John de la Mare who passed the boat on to his son also called\
  \ John de la Mare. She won Guernsey regatta races in 1912, 1913 and 1920. Walter\
  \ Gauvain bought her from John de la Mare Jnr. in 1954 and took her to Alderney\
  \ where he fished with her under motor to a year before his death.&nbsp; Her top\
  \ planks were badly smashed when a bigger boat laid on her and he was going to break\
  \ her up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His grandson, Charles Greenslade decided to take her on\
  \ and repair the damage and put a cabin and a tripod on for lights intending to\
  \ use her as a motor fishing boat. In 1970 he decided to return her to sail as a\
  \ gaff cutter. He has subsequently replaced the cabin top in 1983 and in 1985 he\
  \ replaced the mast and increased the luff of the mainsail.</p>"
