short_description: "Dawn was designed by a pupil of Albert Strange. Her lines are
  published in\nYachting Monthly July 1905."
full_description: "The sailing yawl *Dawn* was designed by Gilbert Umfreville Laws,
  a partner of J\nA Youl in the design and shipyard business of Laws Youl & Co at
  the Burnham Boat\nBuilding Company at Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex. \n\n\nGilbert Laws
  (Jan 8 1870 - Dec 3 1918) artist, sailor and naval architect had\nlearnt his trade
  in yacht design as a student of Albert Strange (1855-1917) the\nfamous yacht designer,
  artist, sailor and writer. Besides being a successful\ndesigner Gilbert was a first
  rate helmsman winning the gold medal in his own\ndesign at the 1908 Olympics. His
  6-metre yacht “*Dormy*” was placed respectively\n1st, 2nd and 3rd in the three race
  event held off Ryde, Isle of Wight. \n\n\nThe concept of the ‘canoe yawl’ theme
  was continued by Gilbert from his early\ntutelage with Albert Strange. The Canoe
  Yawl Association describes the style as\nbeing a slim, easily-driven, decked hull
  with a stem at each end and carrying a\nyawl rig. Gilbert Laws’ design was a continuation
  of Strange’s work combined\nwith his own development from days as a youth paddling
  canoes. The low aspect\nratio of the yawl rig suited the narrow beam better than
  would a single-masted\nrig: its divided sail area much assisted helm balance, maneuverability,
  and\nprogress in strong winds combined with no need for a paid hand. The sail area\n
  may be rapidly reduced in a strong blow by reefing the mainsail down to leave a\n
  ‘jib and mizzen’ configuration for safe, well-balanced progress. Such a style\n
  was particularly developed in the 1880s at the Humber Yawl Club. The sails may\n
  be of any fore-and-aft type, and in any combination, and whether the mizzen is\n
  before or behind the rudder post (the technical definitions of ketch and yawl)\n
  is of no consequence to the Association rather it is more a matter of sail\ndistribution
  and proportion.\n\n\nThe association considered the canoe yawl as a subtle combination
  of hull and\nrig proportions which, in general, could not be achieved by conversion
  from\nother design types such as a sloop or cutter as in such circumstances it was\n
  thought unlikely that the hull would suit given its beam and the need for the\n
  mainmast to be relocated. Such an exercise, with no guarantee of success, was\n
  deemed to be ill-advised. It was admitted that for a given building cost the\ncanoe
  yawl provides less capacity and accommodation but greater length than a\nsloop or
  cutter. Its relative unpopularity in the commercial marketplace was due\nto its
  lesser capacity and higher mooring charges but was deemed ideal for those\nnot wishing
  to sleep 4-up in a small boat and who avoid marinas where possible.\nRather for
  those demanding beauty and performance in their boat with the most\nappropriate
  rig for the single- or short-handed sailor across the full range of\nconditions
  likely to be encountered — including those where many sloops or\ncutters would be
  unmanageable, then the rig was deemed ideal. \n\n\n*Dawn* was built at the yard
  of W E Thomas in Falmouth. According to the 1891\ncensus Thomas was born in Ruan
  Minor(?) and was living at 2 Arwyn Cottage with\nhis sons Betram 25 and Thomas 21.
  Thomas’ yard was well known for its design and\nbuild of Quay Punts but was eventually
  closed in after which the property was\ndeveloped to include the present Falmouth
  Maritime Museum.\n\n\nIn 1924 an engine was fitted.\n\n\n*Dawn* sailed to Dover
  in May 1940 with a small volunteer flotilla led by the\nDartmouth steam ferry to
  join ‘Operation Dynamo’ but in fact poor weather\ndelayed their arrival to permit
  full participation. Dawn’s participation at\nDunkirk is set out in David Devine’s
  “The Nine days of Dunkirk” published in\n1959. This action is further substantiated
  by Mr A J Gush of 8 East Street,\nChard, Somerset who’s correspondence on board
  dated 16.11.86 wrote of confirming\nher presence with the then owner in Solihull. \n
  \n\n**Owners** of *Dawn* have included:-\n\n\n1906 **H S Algar** of 2 Kingston Villas
  Romford and who by 1938 lived at Lusaka,\nKirby Road, Walton, Colchester. Believed
  to have been a friend of G U Laws and\nwho commissioned the build.\n\n\n1909 **Albert
  John Gush** of Axminster, Devon. B 1874. In the 1881 Census he was\nin the Devon
  & Exeter Hospital, in 1901 he was on board HMS Wanderer in Gotland\nHarbour. In
  1911 he was living with his mother at 10 Bridge Street Lyme Regis\nand his occupation
  was stated as ‘fishmonger’ after his mother. He married Julia\nAnne and died in
  1922 at Lyme Regis aged 48 when his occupation was a ‘coach\nbody builder’. *Dawn*
  appears to have been sold from the estate.\n\n\n1923 - 1954 **John Roger Gregory**
  of Little Ravenswell Kingswear. Born 1893 and\ndied Kingswear 1980.\n\n\nSeptember
  20 1954: **Thomas Aird Burnley Murray**, was born March 16 1912 in\nToronto Canada.
  Thomas lived his working career at 3 Moorland Court, Lawn Road,\nas a civil engineer.
  At Doncaster Aero Club he gained Aviator’s Certificate\n16766 on a British Aircraft
