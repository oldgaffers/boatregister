  Yachting Monthly July 1905.
full_description: |-
  The sailing yawl *Dawn* was designed by Gilbert Umfreville Laws, a partner of J
  A Youl in the design and shipyard business of Laws Youl & Co at the Burnham Boat
  Building Company at Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex. 


  Gilbert Laws (Jan 8 1870 - Dec 3 1918) artist, sailor and naval architect had
  learnt his trade in yacht design as a student of Albert Strange (1855-1917) the
  famous yacht designer, artist, sailor and writer. Besides being a successful
  designer Gilbert was a first rate helmsman winning the gold medal in his own
  design at the 1908 Olympics. His 6-metre yacht “*Dormy*” was placed respectively
  1st, 2nd and 3rd in the three race event held off Ryde, Isle of Wight. 


  The concept of the ‘canoe yawl’ theme was continued by Gilbert from his early
  tutelage with Albert Strange. The Canoe Yawl Association describes the style as
  being a slim, easily-driven, decked hull with a stem at each end and carrying a
  yawl rig. Gilbert Laws’ design was a continuation of Strange’s work combined
  with his own development from days as a youth paddling canoes. The low aspect
  ratio of the yawl rig suited the narrow beam better than would a single-masted
  rig: its divided sail area much assisted helm balance, maneuverability, and
  progress in strong winds combined with no need for a paid hand. The sail area
  may be rapidly reduced in a strong blow by reefing the mainsail down to leave a
  ‘jib and mizzen’ configuration for safe, well-balanced progress. Such a style
  was particularly developed in the 1880s at the Humber Yawl Club. The sails may
  be of any fore-and-aft type, and in any combination, and whether the mizzen is
  before or behind the rudder post (the technical definitions of ketch and yawl)
  is of no consequence to the Association rather it is more a matter of sail
  distribution and proportion.


  The association considered the canoe yawl as a subtle combination of hull and
  rig proportions which, in general, could not be achieved by conversion from
  other design types such as a sloop or cutter as in such circumstances it was
  thought unlikely that the hull would suit given its beam and the need for the
  mainmast to be relocated. Such an exercise, with no guarantee of success, was
  deemed to be ill-advised. It was admitted that for a given building cost the
  canoe yawl provides less capacity and accommodation but greater length than a
  sloop or cutter. Its relative unpopularity in the commercial marketplace was due
  to its lesser capacity and higher mooring charges but was deemed ideal for those
  not wishing to sleep 4-up in a small boat and who avoid marinas where possible.
  Rather for those demanding beauty and performance in their boat with the most
  appropriate rig for the single- or short-handed sailor across the full range of
  conditions likely to be encountered — including those where many sloops or
  cutters would be unmanageable, then the rig was deemed ideal. 


  *Dawn* was built at the yard of W E Thomas in Falmouth. According to the 1891
  census Thomas was born in Ruan Minor(?) and was living at 2 Arwyn Cottage with
  his sons Betram 25 and Thomas 21. Thomas’ yard was well known for its design and
  build of Quay Punts but was eventually closed in after which the property was
  developed to include the present Falmouth Maritime Museum.


  In 1924 an engine was fitted.


  *Dawn* sailed to Dover in May 1940 with a small volunteer flotilla led by the
  Dartmouth steam ferry to join ‘Operation Dynamo’ but in fact poor weather
  delayed their arrival to permit full participation. Dawn’s participation at
  Dunkirk is set out in David Devine’s “The Nine days of Dunkirk” published in
  1959. This action is further substantiated by Mr A J Gush of 8 East Street,
  Chard, Somerset who’s correspondence on board dated 16.11.86 wrote of confirming
  her presence with the then owner in Solihull. 


  **Owners** of *Dawn* have included:-


  1906 **H S Algar** of 2 Kingston Villas Romford and who by 1938 lived at Lusaka,
  Kirby Road, Walton, Colchester. Believed to have been a friend of G U Laws and
  who commissioned the build.


  1909 **Albert John Gush** of Axminster, Devon. B 1874. In the 1881 Census he was
  in the Devon & Exeter Hospital, in 1901 he was on board HMS Wanderer in Gotland
  Harbour. In 1911 he was living with his mother at 10 Bridge Street Lyme Regis
  and his occupation was stated as ‘fishmonger’ after his mother. He married Julia
  Anne and died in 1922 at Lyme Regis aged 48 when his occupation was a ‘coach
  body builder’. *Dawn* appears to have been sold from the estate.


  1923 - 1954 **John Roger Gregory** of Little Ravenswell Kingswear. Born 1893 and
  died Kingswear 1980.


  September 20 1954: **Thomas Aird Burnley Murray**, was born March 16 1912 in
