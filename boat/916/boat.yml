  Dawn was designed by a pupil of Albert Strange. Her lines are published in
  Yachting Monthly July 1905.

full_description: "The sailing yawl *Dawn* was designed by Gilbert Umfreville Laws,\
  \ a partner of J\nA Youl in the design and shipyard business of Laws Youl & Co at\
  \ the Burnham Boat\nBuilding Company at Burnham on Crouch, Essex.\_\n\nGilbert Laws\
  \ (Jan 8 1870 - Dec 3 1918) artist, sailor and naval architect had\nlearnt his trade\
  \ in yacht design as a student of Albert Strange (1855-1917) the\nfamous yacht designer,\
  \ artist, sailor and writer. Besides being a successful\ndesigner Gilbert was a\
  \ first rate helmsman winning the gold medal in his own\ndesign at the 1908 Olympics.\
  \ His 6-metre yacht \u201C*Dormy*\u201D was placed respectively\n1st, 2nd and 3rd\
  \ in the three race event held off Ryde, Isle of Wight.\_\n\nThe concept of the\
  \ \u2018canoe yawl\u2019 theme was continued by Gilbert from his early\ntutelage\
  \ with Albert Strange. The Canoe Yawl Association describes the style as\nbeing\
  \ a slim, easily-driven, decked hull with a stem at each end and carrying a\nyawl\
  \ rig. Gilbert Laws\u2019 design was a continuation of Strange\u2019s work combined\n\
  with his own development from days as a youth paddling canoes. The low aspect\n\
  ratio of the yawl rig suited the narrow beam better than would a single-masted\n\
  rig: its divided sail area\_much assisted helm balance, maneuverability, and\nprogress\
  \ in strong winds combined with no need for a paid hand. The sail area\nmay be rapidly\
  \ reduced in a strong blow by reefing the mainsail down to leave a\n\u2018jib and\
  \ mizzen\u2019 configuration for safe, well-balanced progress. Such a style\nwas\
  \ particularly developed in the 1880s at the Humber Yawl Club. The sails may\nbe\
  \ of any fore-and-aft type, and in any combination, and whether the mizzen is\n\
  before or behind the rudder post (the\_technical definitions of ketch and yawl)\n\
  is of no consequence to the Association rather it is more a matter of\_sail\ndistribution\
  \ and proportion.\n\nThe association considered the canoe yawl as a subtle combination\
  \ of hull and\nrig proportions which, in general, could not be achieved by conversion\
  \ from\nother design types such as a sloop or cutter as in such circumstances it\
  \ was\nthought unlikely that the hull would suit given its beam and the need for\
  \ the\nmainmast to be relocated. Such an exercise, with no guarantee of success,\
  \ was\ndeemed to be ill-advised. It was admitted that for a given building cost\
  \ the\ncanoe yawl provides less capacity and accommodation\_but greater length than\
  \ a\nsloop or cutter. Its relative unpopularity in the commercial marketplace was\
  \ due\nto its lesser capacity and higher mooring charges but was deemed ideal for\
  \ those\nnot wishing to sleep 4-up in a small boat and who avoid marinas where possible.\n\
  Rather for those demanding beauty and performance in their boat with the most\n\
  appropriate rig for the single- or short-handed sailor across the full range of\n\
  conditions likely to be encountered \u2014 including those where many sloops or\n\
  cutters would be unmanageable, then the rig was deemed ideal.\_\n\n*Dawn* was built\
  \ at the yard of W E Thomas in Falmouth. According to the 1891\ncensus Thomas was\
  \ born in Ruan Minor(?) and was living at 2 Arwyn Cottage with\nhis sons Betram\
  \ 25 and Thomas 21. Thomas\u2019 yard was well known for its design and\nbuild of\
  \ Quay Punts but was eventually closed in after which the property was\ndeveloped\
  \ to include the present Falmouth Maritime Museum.\n\nIn 1924 an engine was fitted.\n\
  \n*Dawn* sailed to Dover in May 1940 with a small volunteer flotilla led by the\n\
  Dartmouth steam ferry to join \u2018Operation Dynamo\u2019 but in fact poor weather\n\
  delayed their arrival to permit full participation. Dawn\u2019s participation at\n\
  Dunkirk is set out in David Devine\u2019s \u201CThe Nine days of Dunkirk\u201D published\
  \ in\n1959. This action is further substantiated by Mr A J Gush of 8 East Street,\n\
  Chard, Somerset who\u2019s correspondence on board dated 16.11.86 wrote of confirming\n\
  her presence with the then owner in Solihull.\_\n\n**Owners** of *Dawn* have included:-\n\
  \n1906 **H S Algar** of 2 Kingston Villas Romford and who by 1938 lived at Lusaka,\n\
  Kirby Road, Walton, Colchester. Believed to have been a friend of G U Laws and\n\
  who commissioned the build.\n\n1909 **Albert John Gush** of Axminster, Devon. B\
  \ 1874. In the 1881 Census he was\nin the Devon & Exeter Hospital, in 1901 he was\
  \ on board HMS Wanderer in Gotland\nHarbour. In 1911 he was living with his mother\
  \ at 10 Bridge Street Lyme Regis\nand his occupation was stated as \u2018fishmonger\u2019\
  \ after his mother. He married Julia\nAnne and died in 1922 at Lyme Regis aged 48\
  \ when his occupation was a \u2018coach\nbody builder\u2019. *Dawn* appears to have\
  \ been sold from the estate.\n\n1923 - 1954 **John Roger Gregory** of Little Ravenswell\
  \ Kingswear. Born 1893 and\ndied Kingswear 1980.\n\nSeptember 20 1954: **Thomas\
