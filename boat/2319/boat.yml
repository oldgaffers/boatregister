full_description: <p>The local fishing craft that worked the coastal waters from Solway
  to Aberystwyth were very similar in form to the yachts of the period which is why
  Laura and several other yachts were used as very capable inshore trawlers. Laura
  is a little deeper draftedthan a trawler of the same length but the fishing grounds
  worked out of Fleetwood and Douglas would allow for this. &nbsp;Laura appeared as
  a subject of a book, written by Edward Delmar- Morgan in the early 1950's. He probably
  bought her in 1950 or 1951 as the book describes her refit and first cruise she
  made to France before the book was published in 1954. She was Bermudan rigged then
  with a substantial coach roof and fitted with a wing engine. Laura was in a rundown
  state when Delmar-Morgan found her, so he motored her round to Portsmouth Harbour
  for a thorough refit. Most of the work seems to have been cosmetic. An accident
  occurred that showed she was still using her original beaching legs that fastened
  to a large eyebolt through the beam shelf and deck. One of these pulled through
  the deck causing a fair amount of real work on top of addressing the effects of
  the neglect. &nbsp;Laura knocked around the south coast during the next 30 years,
  to be found, still with her Bermudan Rig.Laura was bought by Bill Sissons in 1980.
  She sailed in the seasons of 1980 and 1981 and was then laid up in a mud berth.
  Gayle Heard the sail maker helped bring her round to the Blackwater. He was looking
  for a fast boat and was so impressed he bought her in 1985. he then undertook a
  6 year total re-build, all frames were replaced with steamed timbers. By replacing
  the cast iron keelson and concrete ballast with lead, her headroom was improved.
  She was returned to gaff rig with hollow spars and a new suit of sails. The rebuild
  was not complete as she has 90% of her planking, her keel and sternpost. Port and
  starboard top strakes were replaced and stringers were inserted to stiffen her up.
  The deck and above is all new. The rebuild was finished in 1991 and she raced very
  successfully for the next 10 years. &nbsp;Bought &amp; returned to Fleetwood 2001
  and raced very successfully in Nobby Owners and Conwy River Festival. Laid up 2007
  to 2018 then sold and repairs carried out at Waterfront Marine by Scott Metcalfe.
