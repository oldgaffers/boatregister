full_description: "<p>As &#39;Susan Ashley&#39; she was the Brook Isle of Wight Lifeboat\
  \ in the 1930s. She was converted for the film &#39;The Riddle of the Sands&#39;.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>After the film was shot &#39;Dulcibella&#39; had two or three owners and\
  \ went to Poole. She was bought by two Germans who painted her black and set off\
  \ for Hamburg. On the way she was wrecked off the coast where the story &#39;Riddle\
  \ of the Sands&#39; is set, the east Frisian Islands. Sadly her crew were lost.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>The book &#39;Riddle of the Sands&#39; was written by Erskine Childers\
  \ in 1903 and is the first espionage story. it is set in the East Frisian Islands\
  \ and centres around two English sailors who uncover a plot by the Germans to invade\
  \ Britain through the Wash, at that time unprotected by the British Navy.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>Erskine Childers wrote the book to advocate the preparedness for war as the\
  \ best form of defence. He was a famous sailor, a member of the Royal Cruising Club\
  \ having won a number of their trophies. His yacht &#39;Asgard&#39; was a wedding\
  \ present from his wife&#39;s family. In 1914 he used her for gun running into Ireland\
  \ and was eventually shot by the Free Irish. <a href=\"http://www.sailing-by.org.uk/content/gun-running-irish-sea-july-1914\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Read more about this on &#39;Sailing by&#39;</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Childers&#39; boat &#39;Asgard&#39; has been restored and is in a museum in Dublin.\
  \ The film was produced by Worldmark Productions Ltd. Laurent Giles and Partners\
  \ designed the conversion of the &#39;Susan Ashley&#39;, giving her a centreboard\
  \ to make her suitable for sailing in shallow and deep waters. Spencer&#39;s were\
  \ responsible for the spars and J Rawlings of &#39;G&#39; Sailmakers made the sails.</p>"
