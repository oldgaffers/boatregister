  sales_text: <p>Three years ago Robert Simper (one of the founder&nbsp;members of
    the OGA) persuaded me to take on, as a retirement job, the restoration of "Boy
    Frank" a 1957 Yarmouth shrimper.&nbsp;</p><p>A subsequent stroke, other problems
    and four grandchildren has made me realise I could not find the time to restore
    the boat. I am looking to give it away as a restoration project. The .oat is presently
    covered on a trailer in a boat park opposite&nbsp;Felixstowe Ferry. The trailer
    is included but needs new tyres and some work to make it road legal.&nbsp;The
    boat"s engine was working prior to flooding, when the starter was damaged. Lots
    of spars, mast and various parts included.</p><p>She needs lots of TLC to bring
    her back to life.&nbsp;</p>
