full_description: "<p>&#39;Letty May&#39;, built 1978, is a Memory 19, designed by\
  \ Tony Robinson, MRINA, when he was working at James and Stone in 1974. The lines\
  \ are based on a boat named &#39;Brownie&#39; built in the 1920s. Brownie&#39;s\
  \ owner had wanted a boat based on Stone&#39;s workboats of the turn of the century.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>The first owner bought her as a kit open version and built his own cabin,\
  \ not liking the GRP standard cabins of that time. The second owner kept her on\
  \ Walton Backwaters for 19 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2000 she has been sailing\
  \ and racing&nbsp;out of the River Blackwater.</p>"
