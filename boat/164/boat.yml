short_description: |-
  Iskra was built by David Hillyard in 1930 as a straight keeled gaff cutter yacht
  typical of the period. Since the 1960s she has sailed extensively and had a full
  refit in the 1990s.She is now in excellent condition and ready for sea having
  had a full repaint and tidy-up after her 3 seasons in the Baltic based in the
  vicinity of Rügen in North East Germany.During her time ion the Baltic she
  cruised to Sweden and the Danish islands including Bornholm.

  Little is known about Iskra's history before Frank Mulville bought her in the
  1960s, sailing her until his death in 1997. His voyages are brought to life in a
  series of extremely readable and popular books in which he described various
  passages. Mulville's voyages included several single-handed transatlantic
  crossings, a circumnavigation of Iceland and a cruise to Argentina. They are
  beautifully captured in his books which give testament to Iskra's sailing
  characteristics and seaworthiness.

  Nick Zienau bought Iskra in 1998 and she needed a refit which involved replacing
  the iron floors, checking keelbolts and re-covering the pine deck with marine
  ply and glass cloth in epoxy along with an entirely new cockpit, new tanks
  (diesel, gas and paraffin), rewiring the electrics and a new interior in marine
  ply with ash tongue and groove lining. The boom, bowsprit and gaff were also
  replaced, and she had new sails in 2014.

  Since the refit she has cruised to Brittany, the English West country, the
  Netherlands and spent three seasons in the Baltic. Iskra is a fine passage-maker
  and attracts admiring attention wherever she goes.

  She has recently had a full repaint and been revarnished and is in excellent
  condition throughout.

Her current owner has cruised around UK and European waters including Southern Brittany and latterly 3 years in the Baltic including some single-handed passages.Iskra sleeps 4 (5 at a pinch) and can be handled easily by two people.Her early
    history is unknown but her previous owner was Frank Mulville who bought her in
    the 1970s and sailed her extensively both single-handed and with his wife Wendy.
    He wrote a number of fine books about his voyages which included several
    Atlantic crossings, a circumnavigation of Iceland and a long trip to the country
    of his birth, Argentina. ### Construction   She is a conventional gaff cutter of
    the period with a hull reminiscent of South Coast fishing vessels, long straight
    keel, maximum beam quite far forward in the way of the chainplates and a
    beautiful run aft. Strong traditional construction - pitch pine on oak. ###
    Condition   Bought by the current owner in 2000/2001, Iskra had a major refit by
    Brian Kennell of Maldon including new cast iron floors, keel bolts checked, deck
    strengthened and waterproofed with marine ply/epoxy covering. Totally new but
    traditional interior in marine ply covered in varnished ash tongue & groove by
    Adrian Riva of Maldon.  Ply bulkheads were tied into the structure to strengthen
    the hull in the mast step and chainplates. Cockpit and cabin sides original
    solid teak. A new rudder was also built and refitted at that time.  Since the
    refit Iskra has been regularly surveyed and any recommendations have been fully
