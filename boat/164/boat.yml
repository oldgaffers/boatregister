full_description: <p>Little is known about Iskra's history before Frank Mulville bought
  her in the 1960s, sailing her until his death in 1997. His voyages are brought to
  life in a series of extremely readable and popular books in which he described various
  passages. Mulville's voyages included several single-handed transatlantic crossings,
  a circumnavigation of Iceland and a cruise to Argentina. They are beautifully captured
  in his books which give testament to Iskra's sailing characteristics and seaworthiness.</p><p>Nick
  Zienau bought Iskra in 1998 and she needed a refit which involved replacing the
  iron floors, checking keelbolts and re-covering the pine deck with marine ply and
  glass cloth in epoxy along with an entirely new cockpit, new tanks (diesel, gas
  and paraffin), rewiring the electrics and a new interior in marine ply with ash
  tongue and groove lining. The boom, bowsprit and gaff were also replaced, and she
  had new sails in 2014.</p><p>Since the refit she has cruised to Brittany, the English
  West country, the Netherlands and spent three seasons in the Baltic. Iskra is a
  fine passage-maker and attracts admiring attention wherever she goes.</p><p>She
  has recently had a full repaint and been revarnished and is in excellent condition
  throughout.</p>
