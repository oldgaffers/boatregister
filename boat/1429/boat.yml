short_description: ''
full_description: '<p><em>Theta</em> was built in 1982 to a hull design by Percy Dalton
  based closely on the lines of the Falmouth Quay Punts of the late19th/early20th
  century. Little is known of her early years when she was based on the East Coast
  &nbsp;In 1997 a new owner moved her to Guernsey where he carried out an extensive
  rebuild of the deck, coachroof and interior to a very high standard.</p>

  <p>In 2005 ownership changed again and her home port became Weymouth. During this
  ownership she made a brief appearance in the film "The Boat that Rocked" and a new
  engine was fitted for the 2010 season.</p>

  <p>Her next owner bought her in 2013 and she moved to Salcombe. Since then she has
  cruised extensively on the Devon and Cornish coast, the Channel Islands, and the
  north and west coasts of Brittany visiting many classic boat gatherings including
  Brest, Douarnenez and Paimpol in France and Brixham<del>,</del> Falmouth, Plymouth
  and Dartmouth in UK. &nbsp;With increasing knowledge of the boat and some fine tuning
  she has proved to be a very successful competitor in classic racing and easy to
  sail as a single hander.</p>

  <p>Leighton Hargreaves bought her in 2022 and she moved to the Exe.</p>'
