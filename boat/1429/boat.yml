full_description: "<p><em>Theta</em> was built in 1982 to a hull design by Percy Dalton
  based closely on the lines of the Falmouth Quay Punts of the late19th/early20th
  century. Little is known of her early years when she was based on the East Coast
  &nbsp;In 1997 a new owner moved her to Guernsey where he carried out an extensive
  rebuild of the deck, coachroof and interior to a very high standard.</p>\n<p>In
  2005 ownership changed again and her home port became Weymouth. During this ownership
  she made a brief appearance in the film \"The Boat that Rocked\" and a new engine
  was fitted for the 2010 season.</p>\n<p>Her next owner bought her in 2013 and she
  moved to Salcombe. Since then she has cruised extensively on the Devon and Cornish
  coast, the Channel Islands, and the north and west coasts of Brittany visiting many
  classic boat gatherings including Brest, Douarnenez and Paimpol in France and Brixham<del>,</del>
  Falmouth, Plymouth and Dartmouth in UK. &nbsp;With increasing knowledge of the boat
  and some fine tuning she has proved to be a very successful competitor in classic
  racing and easy to sail as a single hander.</p>\n<p>Leighton Hargreaves bought her
  in 2022 and she moved to the Exe.</p>"
