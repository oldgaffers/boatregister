short_description: |-
  Now believed to be lost / broken up in the Medwat around 2017. Built in Poole as
  a fishing smack, and converted to a yacht in 1947 at Christchurch, 'Margaret
  Catchpole' was kept at Pin Mill until 2003 when she was moved to Rochester.
full_description: |-
  Launched as the 'Eureka' in 1911, and registered for fishing 25 November 1911,
  tonnage 10.8 and fishing no. PE62. She is believed to be the last of the larger
  Poole smacks.

   'Margaret Catchpole' was well known on the East Coast having been kept at Pin
  Mill on the River Orwell for 50 years and subsequently on the River Medway at
  Lower Upnor since 2003.

   'Margaret' is a very stiff boat and easy to sail. She has been continually
  upgraded and refurbished in traditional and authentic materials since 2003 to
  keep her sailing.

   In 2016, she was sold following the death of her owner.
