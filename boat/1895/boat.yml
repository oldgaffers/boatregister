full_description: |-
  Ferryman III is a 20’ topsail schooner, 26' with bowsprit, built as a 'one off'
  in 1950. She is an Old Gaffers Dayboat eligible for The Dinghy Cruising
  Association and had a complete refurbishment between 1996 and 1999. Based in
  Scotland, she has a GRP hull, with nearly everything else spruce, teak, iroko,
  mahogany, bronze, aluminium and a bit of galvanised iron, mainly the lifting
  centreplate.


  She won the OGA Pitchfork for the longest voyage to Solent Gaffers Race:
  Blackchub to Bursledon, 400 miles under full sail down the motorway on the back
  of a trailer!
