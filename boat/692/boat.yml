full_description: "<h3>First published as cover story in Gaffers Log, 1980/1</h3>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Lieutenant-Commander Edward Michael Shaw, Royal Indian Navy, Retired, owned\
  \ &#39;Martlet&#39; since 1960, and wrote the cover story. Extracts are published\
  \ here:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&#39;Martlet&#39; may be the only boat under the\
  \ OGA burgee which has also flown the burgee and defaced blue ensign of the Royal\
  \ Bombay Yacht Club.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>John Lawrence Westmacott was\
  \ a very well-known cruising yachtsman. After being laid up during the second world\
  \ war, she was one of the first yachts to visit Alderney after the war, cruised\
  \ extensively on the Brittany coast and went round to Belle Isle. Brigadier Foley\
  \ was Vice Commodore of the Island Cruising Club at Salcombe and cruised as far\
  \ as Vigo in the south and Southern Ireland in the west, finally settling in Baltimore.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>&#39;Martlet&#39; is a great family boat and I know she has taught\
  \ my three children (now 37, 35 and 31) a lot they would never have learnt on dry\
  \ land. In the first year [1960] with my then young crew, we went west to Newlyn\
  \ and east to Dartmouth. During the winters that followed, Sundays out from school\
  \ were often spent scraping or sanding and one year we humped out the ton and a\
  \ quarter of internal pig iron ballast and put it all back.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\
  <blockquote>We made the Isles of Scilly one year and having sheltered there from\
  \ a gale, had to motor all the way back to Plymouth, and the old Handy Billy ran\
  \ continuously for 25 hours. Another year we visited Guernsey, Jersey and St Malo\
  \ and then because of bad weather and my leave had run out we had to leave &#39;Martlet&#39;\
  \ in Guernsey and fly home.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&#39;Martlet&#39;s sails\
  \ when I had her first were all canvas, with one exception. This was an old light\
  \ cotton spinnaker/Genoa. It had been white, but was no longer an advertisement\
  \ for Persil, aand was affectionately known as &#39;old dirty&#39;.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>In recent years, &#39;Martlet&#39; has been seen in the events\
  \ of the South West Area of the Old Gaffers Association and at Bucktrout Rallies\
  \ and St Malo. By the way, &#39;Martlet&#39; and &#39;Wilful&#39; (Jonathan Ward-Hayne)\
  \ were the only old gaffers to escort the Royal Yacht up to St Peter Port.</blockquote>"
