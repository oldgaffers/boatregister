short_description: <p>Kingfisher of Hamford Water is a sailing dinghy, probably one
  of the last sailing vessels built at Chatham Naval Dockyard.</p>
full_description: "<p>Designed by Charles Nicholson and Uffa Fox, &#39;Kingfisher&#39;\
  \ was built in the 1930s at Chatham Naval Dockyard, probably one of the last sailing\
  \ vessels they ever built there. She served at HMS Ganges, Shotley, then moved to\
  \ the Royal Hospital School in the mid 1970s, after Ganges station closed. She was\
  \ used for training in a fleet of 10 RNSA 14&rsquo; dinghies. The RNSA fleet was\
  \ sold in 1978-79 with at least eight boats going to a hire firm at Felixstowe.\
  \ She was purchased from the Bosun and kept at the Colonel&rsquo;s hard on the Twizzle,\
  \ which was later to become Titchmarsh Marina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RNSA&#39;s like Kingfisher\
  \ are rare now. Many were burnt at Plymouth when the Navy turned to GRP Bosun dinghies\
  \ in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charles Harrison purchased her in 2003 and completed\
  \ her restoration, taking her to the Brest and Douarnenez Festivals in 2004 and\
  \ sailing her in Chichester Harbour and the Solent. Since then she has been kept\
  \ under cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She retains many original features, including superb\
  \ bronze fittings that would make I K Brunel whistle. Peppered with crowsfeet and\
  \ Chatham marks on every surface, her beautiful Egyptian cotton sails have Chatham\
  \ sail loft marks, made in the 1960s.</p>"
