short_description: <p>Kingfisher of Hamford Water is a sailing dinghy, probably one
  of the last sailing vessels built at Chatham Naval Dockyard.</p>
full_description: "<p>Designed by Charles Nicholson and Uffa Fox, &#39;Kingfisher&#39;
  was built in the 1930s at Chatham Naval Dockyard, probably one of the last sailing
  vessels they ever built there. She served at HMS Ganges, Shotley, then moved to
  the Royal Hospital School in the mid 1970s, after Ganges station closed. She was
  used for training in a fleet of 10 RNSA 14&rsquo; dinghies. The RNSA fleet was sold
  in 1978-79 with at least eight boats going to a hire firm at Felixstowe. She was
  purchased from the Bosun and kept at the Colonel&rsquo;s hard on the Twizzle, which
  was later to become Titchmarsh Marina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RNSA&#39;s like Kingfisher
  are rare now. Many were burnt at Plymouth when the Navy turned to GRP Bosun dinghies
  in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charles Harrison purchased her in 2003 and completed
  her restoration, taking her to the Brest and Douarnenez Festivals in 2004 and sailing
  her in Chichester Harbour and the Solent. Since then she has been kept under cover.</p>\r
  \n\r\n<p>She retains many original features, including superb bronze fittings that
  would make I K Brunel whistle. Peppered with crowsfeet and Chatham marks on every
  surface, her beautiful Egyptian cotton sails have Chatham sail loft marks, made
  in the 1960s.</p>"

  sales_text: <p>RNSA"s like Kingfisher are&nbsp; rare now. Many were burnt at Plymouth
    when the Navy turned to GRP Bosun dinghies in the 1970s.</p><p>If you are looking
    for a very stable, true classic dinghy of impeccable pedigree (the designers were
    Charles Nicholson and Uffa Fox, no less), consider our Kingfisher. She is ideal
    for Classic Festivals and&nbsp; has an amazing history - Chatham Dockyard-built
    (as was HMS Victory!) owned by the HMS Ganges and the Royal Hospital School, saved
    at the eleventh hour from a fate worse then death on a boating lake in Felixstowe
    and cared for&nbsp; by&nbsp; her previous owner (ex-Navy) in a way that would
    bring a smile to the face of the strictest Bosun. Totally original (except for
    standing and running rigging) and with superb bronze fittings that would make
    I K Brunel whistle. Peppered with crowsfeet and Chatham marks on every surface.
    Two suits of beautiful Egyptian cotton sails with Chatham sail loft marks, made
    in 1960"s but in "new" condition, one suit probably unused.</p><p>We"re not racers
    by nature but on the few occasions she has done it she shows most day boats a
    clean transom. However, we think Kingfisher is best suited to swanning about and
    looking beautifully antique. Although gunter rigged (makes road transport easier)
    she has the definite gaffer feel (two halyards).</p><p>Plus, if you fancy tapping
    into the revived interest in rowing, she offers 4 rowing positions - we have a
    pair of the original Admiralty pattern oars and bronze rowlocks.</p><p>She comes
    with an elderly, but serviceable, Snipe trailer and is viewable subject to appointment
    in the boatshed where she has been stored during our ownership.</p>
