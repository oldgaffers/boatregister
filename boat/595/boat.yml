short_description: <p>Believed to have been built as a smack in 1887, named &#39;Rover&#39;,
  by Aldous of Brightlingsea, although she probably never fished owing to the state
  of the herring industry at the time. In 1895 she is listed in Lloyds Register as
  &#39;Citara&#39;, when it is assumed she was converted to a yacht.</p>
