  Interior rebuilt in 1975.
  Having cruised in the Mediteranean for five months in 1977, she returned to the Solent in 1978 and was offered for sale.
  Her current owner bought her in 2016, and slowly but surely returned her to sailing condtions. 2025 saw her first sail
  under canvas since restoration began.
