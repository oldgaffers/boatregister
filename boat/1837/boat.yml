short_description: |-
  *Kamala* was designed by Barry Pope on the local Danish fishing craft. The rig
  is taken from a Helsignor Pilot Boat
full_description: |-
  Orginally a 3/4 deck dayboat, *Kamala* later had a small cabin top added by the
   original builder prior to coming to England  in the late 1990s, Purchased in  
  2016 from her second owner, when laid up in a Hampshire farmyard.


  People who have sailed remark on her feel of a larger boat; she’s steady, well
  balanced, picks up her skirt in a freshening breeze and her shoulders give great
  stability in a heavier wind. Her lower freeboard amidships is really convenient
  but thanks to her raised bow she keeps remarkably dry.
