short_description: |-
  'Kamala' was designed by Barry Pope on the lines of a Danish fishing craft. The
  rig is taken from a Helsignor Pilot Boat
full_description: |-
  Orginally a 3/4 deck dayboat, 'Kamala' later had a small cabin top added by the
  original builder prior to coming to England  in the late 1990s, Purchased in
  2016 from her second owner when laid up in a Hampshire farmyard.


  People who have sailed remark on her feel of a larger boat; she’s steady, well
  balanced, picks up her skirt in a freshening breeze and her shoulders give great
  stability in a heavier wind. Her lower freeboard amidships is really convenient
  but thanks to her raised bow she keeps remarkably dry.
