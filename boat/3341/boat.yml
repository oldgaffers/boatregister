full_description: |-
  Designed by Ed Burnett and Nigel Irens and built by Fairlie Restorations
  on the Hamble in 1997, *Nomad* spent her early years in New Zealand and
  Australia before being transported back to the UK.
  
  Her second owner, Dutch Olympic sailor Boudewijin Binkhorst, moved her to Holland and cared for
  her for over 19 years, increasing the sail area and installing a larger engine.

  She was purchased by new owners in 2017, who brought her back to the UK
  where she will join the Solent Gaffers, based in Poole.
