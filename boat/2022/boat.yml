full_description: |+
  Built in 1974, her hull is from a mould of the Itchen Ferry *Nellie*.
  Having fallen into disrepair, she was rescued in 2015 and her
  owner is undertaking a full restoration at the Royal Northumberland Yacht Club yard.
  The odd spelling of LadybBird is an attempt to negate the &#8216;name change hex&#8217;
  by combining the double *b* of Bushy Barnaby (an old Norfolk word for a ladybird).
