full_description: Given to Roger Hayles 2012. She had not been used for 6 years and
  was in very poor condition with a badly hogged keel. A colony of woodlice inhabited
  the centreboard case. Roger rebuilt her in a year, scarphing in new plank ends,
  fitting fashion pieces to rebuild the stem, putting in a new hog and rebuilding
  the centreboard case as well as the tabernackle.
