short_description: <p>&#39;Windhover&#39; is a 25ft ketch built of mahogany on elm
  by Morgan Giles in 1912.</p>
full_description: "<p>In 1975 her owner since 1973 decided to take a look to see what\
  \ horrors lurked beneath the many layers of paint on her underside. With the worst\
  \ fears about her health soon realised, he was faced with the prospect of an enormous\
  \ yard bill and decided to give up his job and perform drastic surgery himself.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Most of Windhover&#39;s troubles were electrolytic, iron strap floors with\
  \ brass bolts and copper rivets, plus bronze bolts through the floors and into the\
  \ lead keel. The floors fell to pieces when given an exploratory clout with a lump\
  \ hammer, as did the mahogany planking when hit where the brass bolts were.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Another interesting fact is that although evidence indicated she had never\
  \ had any electrical systems except her Mag., most of her copper fastenings had\
  \ badly wasted some, particularly those near to skin fittings (bronze) had wasted\
  \ to green sludge at the timber/planking interface. To add to her troubles every\
  \ single timber had broken due to severe over caulking, and her port and starboard\
  \ lines were definitely not the same, both sides having twelve timbers broken in\
  \ a row along one plank amidships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In places the gaps in the broken\
  \ timbers, and many timbers were broken in two or more places, totalled over 1&frac12;&rdquo;.\
  \ Other minor details were broken and there were rotted bilge stringers and a corroded\
  \ water jacket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The job started very slowly as new skills were learned.\
  \ She was re-planked from the waterline downwards and about 40% above in I&quot;\
  \ mahogany; totally re-timbered in laminated rock elm, and has heavy pitch pine\
  \ floors which span the bilge up to the stringers. The most awkward job, everything\
  \ except the riveting being done single handed, was regaining the yacht&#39;s shape,\
  \ this being accomplished by the use of internal Spanish windlasses, props, wedges,\
  \ and a large hammer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decks which were yellow pine have been scarfed\
  \ half-inch ply, glass sheathed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a bridge deck to accommodate\
  \ the new Petter engine which lives where her companion doors used to be.</p>"
