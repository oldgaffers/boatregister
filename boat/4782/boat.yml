full_description: '<p>''Harbinger'' is a Manx Nobby converted to a gaff cutter; &nbsp;she
  was built some time before 1917, when the last Nobby was built. &nbsp;She underwent
  a major rebuild between 1975-1985 in Shoreham. &nbsp;She moved to the East Coast
  about the turn of the Millenium. A move to Chichester followed in 2007. &nbsp;Edward
  Ferris has owned her since 2021 and keeps her in Dover.</p>

  <p>Harbinger''s history before 1970 is unknown. Mike, the previous custodian, has
  talked to Nobby owners on the Isle of Man and there never was a ''Harbinger'' on
  the fishing Register, but when converted to a yacht there would almost certainly
  have been a change of name. &nbsp;The history we have starts in the mid-70s with
  Eric Deeming''s refit at Shoreham. &nbsp;A new deck and interior, recaulking of
  the hull and a new engine were the main changes then.</p>

  <p>Since 2010, Harbinger has sailed up and down the English Channel from Douarnenez
  to the Ijselmeer and between Dover and Falmouth. &nbsp;Not all in one year though!</p>
