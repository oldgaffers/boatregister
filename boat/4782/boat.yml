short_description: |-
  There is little known about the history of *Harbinger* before
  1970, though she was built on the IOM before 1917, when the last Nobby was launched.
full_description: |-
  *Harbinger* is a Manx Nobby converted to a gaff cutter; she
  was built some time before 1917, when the last Nobby was built. She underwent
  a major rebuild between 1975-1985 in Shoreham. She moved to the East Coast
  about the turn of the Millenium. A move to Chichester followed in 2007. Edward
  Ferris has owned her since 2021 and keeps her in Dover.

  Harbinger's history before 1970 is unknown. Mike, the previous custodian, has
  talked to Nobby owners on the Isle of Man and there never was a *Harbinger* on
  the fishing Register, but when converted to a yacht there would almost certainly
  have been a change of name. The history we have starts in the mid-70s with
  Eric Deeming's refit at Shoreham. A new deck and interior, recaulking of
  the hull and a new engine were the main changes then.

  Since 2010, Harbinger has sailed up and down the English Channel from Douarnenez
  to the Ijselmeer and between Dover and Falmouth. Not all in one year though!

    Harbinger is looking for a new custodian. She is a
    gaff cutter yacht (originally a Manx Nobby fishing boat) now kept in Southampton,
    38' LOD, 50' LOA, 11'6" beam with a max draft 5'6". The
    deck and interior date from a major refit in the late 1970s to mid 1980s.
    Deck recaulked and new rudder made in 2017.

    During 2016 she sailed to Brest and Douarnenez and took part in both Maritime Festivals.

    In 2017 she joined the Solent OGA cruise aimed at reaching the Scilly Isles and, along
    with most of the fleet, reached Falmouth, but got no further.
