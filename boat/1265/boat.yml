full_description: "<h3>Martin Pound, skipper of &#39;Lucy&#39;, thanks the East Coast\
  \ Area for their hospitality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First published, Gaffers Log, September\
  \ 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Firstly thanks to all concerned on the East Coast,\
  \ in particular the President and Secretary, for the hospitality and all the special\
  \ efforts that were made on behalf of OGA yachts &#39;High Barbaree&#39; and &#39;Lucy&#39;\
  \ visiting from the Solent Area. The East Coast is a wonderful cruising area and\
  \ I wonder now why it took so long before I made the effort to visit. The people\
  \ are kindness itself, the scenery is beautiful, the waterways exciting to navigate,\
  \ and the pubs fun. Every waterway has somewhere to anchor, and always seems to\
  \ have two rivers conveniently attached and at different angles so there is always\
  \ a sheltered anchorage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I would like to thank the\
  \ person who so kindly ran down the banks of the Crouch trying to get my attention\
  \ to say that a free berth had been arranged up river; sadly I was looking the other\
  \ way. It would have saved me from the interesting experience of a full ebb and\
  \ a strong contrary sea breeze leading down to the Spitway!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\
  <blockquote>I was amazed by how many Thames Barges are still plying these waters.\
  \ I think I counted 16. Seeing them sailing is the most wonderful sight. I witnessed\
  \ some marvellous seamanship and my congratulations to all those skippers. We had\
  \ a great lunchtime &lsquo;lock- in&rsquo; at the Manningtree Yacht Club (Constable\
  \ country); thank you Steve and John. I have to admit to anchoring &#39;Lucy&#39;\
  \ at Orford and catching a lift with those wiley &lsquo;grand parents&rsquo; Tim\
  \ and Liz Dodwell up to Snape. They were to continue on through the Netherlands\
  \ and up the Baltic to winter the boat in Marienhamm in Finland; a great adventure\
  \ and good example of adventure to us all.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We were\
  \ blessed with offshore winds for most of the time which allowed easy access to\
  \ the Rivers Ore and Deben. Southwold Regatta was a memorable weekend with great\
  \ weather and entertainment. The local brewery was extremely generous in its prizes\
  \ and I am not quite sure what race it was that Lucy won, but 35 pints of Adnams\
  \ best bitter was dutifully carried onboard and shipped across the North Sea for\
  \ dispensing at the Hellevoetsluis Regatta (probably wangled by Jon so that he would\
  \ not run dry of his best tipple!!).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Thank you again\
  \ East Coast; it was a great example of how to host a visiting Gaffer. Memorable\
  \ days.</blockquote>"
