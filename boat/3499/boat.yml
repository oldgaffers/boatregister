full_description: <p>Speedwell of Cremyll was built as a 21st birthday present for
  a lucky young man! She took part in the 1970 Round Britain Race, and the concept
  of the Three Peaks Yacht Race was conceived in her saloon during a gale in Barra.
  She spent about 20 years in the Island Cruising Club fleet at Salcombe, and was
  later based in Oban for a lengthy period. She had a keel-off major refit at Gweek
  in 2018/19.</p>
