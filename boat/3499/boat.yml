full_description: |-
  Speedwell of Cremyll was built as a 21st birthday present for a lucky young man!
  She took part in the 1970 Round Britain Race, and the concept of the Three Peaks
  Yacht Race was conceived in her saloon during a gale in Barra. She spent about
  20 years in the Island Cruising Club fleet at Salcombe, and was later based in
  Oban for a lengthy period. She had a keel-off major refit at Gweek in 2018/19.
