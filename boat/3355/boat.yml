full_description: |-
  *Atalanta* was designed by Uffa Fox in conjunction with Alan Vines, and built as
  an experimental prototype based on experiences gained by the airborne lifeboat
  in World War II and the building of the dinghies *Firefly* andÂ *Albacore* after
  the War. Subsequent production boats, A2 onwards, were 2 feet longer and had
  more headroom.
