full_description: <p>&#39;Atalanta&#39; was designed by Uffa Fox in conjunction with
  Alan Vines, and built as an experimental prototype based on experiences gained by
  the airborne lifeboat in World War II and the building of the dinghies &#39;Firefly&#39;
  and &#39;Albacore&#39;&nbsp;after the War. Subsequent production boats, A2 onwards,
  were 2 feet longer and had more headroom.</p>
