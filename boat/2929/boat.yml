full_description: |-
  The Sun Cat was designed as a “new breed of catboat”. A shoal-draft daysailer
  and overnighter that would rig quickly, sail easily, and comfortably accommodate
  family and friends with plenty of space for gear and stores.


  Rob Cawley of Banbury ordered and imported the boat from Com-Pac Yachts in
  Clearwater, Florida, 2006 and named her *Catsnip*.


  Gerrard Fraser-Williams purchased her in 2009 to sail out of Holyhead and Cemaes
  Bay, Anglesey.


  Father and son Graham and Daniel Stoker purchased her in 2021 with the goal of
  trailer-sailing her from their home waters of SW Wales and NE Essex, as well as
  participating in OGA events.


  *Catsnip* spent 2022 sailing on the Cleddau and then relocated to the River
  Colne in 2023.
