  A modern catboat originally imported from Florida.

full_description: "The Sun Cat was designed as a \u201Cnew breed of catboat\u201D\
  . A shoal-draft daysailer\nand overnighter that would rig quickly, sail easily,\
  \ and comfortably accommodate\nfamily and friends with plenty of space for gear\
  \ and stores.\n\n\nRob Cawley of Banbury ordered and imported the boat from Com-Pac\
  \ Yachts in\nClearwater, Florida, 2006 and named her *Catsnip*.\n\n\nGerrard Fraser-Williams\
  \ purchased her in 2009 to sail out of Holyhead and Cemaes\nBay, Anglesey.\n\n\n\
  Father and son Graham and Daniel Stoker purchased her in 2021 with the goal of\n\
  trailer-sailing her from their home waters of SW Wales and NE Essex, as well as\n\
  participating in OGA events.\n\n\n*Catsnip* spent 2022 sailing on the Cleddau and\
  \ has now relocated to the River\nColne for 2023.\n\n"
