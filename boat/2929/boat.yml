short_description: "The 17' Sun Cat was designed by Clark Mills as \u201Ca new breed\
  \ of catboat\u201D - a\nshoal-draft daysailer and overnighter that would rig quickly,\
  \ sail easily, and\ncomfortably accommodate family and friends with plenty of space\
  \ for gear and\nstores.\n\n"

  Rob Cawley of Banbury ordered and imported the boat from Com-Pac Yachts in
  Clearwater, Florida, 2006 and named her 'Catsnip'.


  Gerrard Fraser-Williams purchased her in 2009 to sail out of Holyhead and Cemaes
  Bay, Anglesey.


  Father and son Graham and Daniel Stoker purchased her in 2021 with the goal of
  trailer-sailing her from their home waters of SW Wales and NE Essex, as well as
  participating in OGA events.


  Catsnip spent 2022 sailing on the Cleddau and has now relocated to the River
  Colne for 2023.
