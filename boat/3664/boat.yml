  *Zephon* is now based in the Netherlands

full_description: "The Zyclon 4-tonner named *Zephon*, was found in Penryn, close\
  \ to Falmouth\nfirmly supported by beaching legs. Her cockpit was not covered and\
  \ not\nself-draining so there was some water in the bilge but other than that she\n\
  looked pretty healthy when we arrived at low tide\n\nDuring the night rain fell\
  \ in abundance and *Zephon*\u2019s bilge was filled again\nwith rainwater. No salty\
  \ taste, so the hull was watertight. A superficial\ninspection of the hull gave\
  \ me confidence that she could be sailed home to\nHolland. I saw 9 broken frames,\
  \ but she was built sturdily enough.\n\nThe deck didn\u2019t leak. Too bad that\
  \ it was covered with polyester which sounded,\nmoving around on it, like walking\
  \ on a freshly laid shell path.\n\nThe hatches were in a bad condition and leaked\
  \ and the cockpit was a shambles of\nloose planks.\n\nSomebody at one time started\
  \ rebuilding the interior of reclaimed timber.\n\nThe previous owner had removed\
  \ the engine and dismounted the shaft tube and\nplugged the hole.\n\nEven so, *Zephon*\
  \ looked healthy and, after all, I was looking for a restoration\nthat I could be\
  \ proud of.\n\nOnce home again, negotiations started resulting in a good deal. Everybody\
  \ happy!\n\nMy plan was to spend a week preparing the boat to make her ready to\
  \ sail to\nHolland without an engine. My friends convinced me that this was not\
  \ a very good\nidea so I considered to use an outboard engine instead. This had\
  \ been tried by\nthe previous owner; it didn\u2019t work well, the propeller came\
  \ out of the water\ntrying to make itself useful as a windmill or the whole engine\
  \ taking a dive\ndisappearing from sight. So, in the end I started looking out for\
  \ a used 10 hp\nYanmar inboard engine.\n\nOn our way\n\nMy car was fully loaded\
  \ with a used Yanmar, spare parts, tools and friends Han\nand Roos and we set out\
  \ to drive to Penryn.\n\nHan and I would prepare the boat for the trip to Holland\
  \ and Rose would drive\nthe car back to Holland. Han postponed his decision to sail\
  \ along as a crew\nmember or not depending on his final analysis of risks involved.\n\
  \nInstead of lifting Zephon out of the water (too expensive: \xA3400) , we decided\
  \ to\ntransport the engine by dinghy and hoist it on board using the boom and main\n\
  sail sheet. Piece of cake. We struggled through thick mud at low tide,\ndismounted\
  \ the disk covering the propeller tube hole, unplugged the hole from\nthe inside\
  \ and shoved in the propeller tube accompanied with lots of kit and\nthen the propeller\
  \ shaft with propeller. We finished the job off by squeezing in\nlots of lubrication\
  \ grease and waited for high tide to see wether or not we had\nto call the fire\
  \ brigade.\n\nEverything stayed watertight. Time for a beer on the harbor quay.\n\
  \nThe previous owner, Giles Gilmore, was out of the country but helped us\ntremendously\
  \ by asking his girlfriend to put her apartment at our disposal.\nFantastic to be\
  \ able to take a hot shower after all the mud, the blood and no\nbeer , than finally\
  \ we had some British ale ,and slept in a real bed.\n\nBack on board of Zephon we\
  \ had to install Yanmar somewhat more aft than where\nthe dismantled engine had\
  \ been, which meant that part of the bridge deck had to\nbe demolished.\n\nMost\
  \ work involved driving back and forth to local stores to score English\nfittings\
  \ to match European hose sizes or discovering that the engine flange was\n1 inch,\
  \ not 25 mm.\n\nThe 3rd day the engine was running and Zephon could be further prepared\
  \ for the\nhigh seas.\n\nOur first few meters with Zephon were hilarious.\n\nWe\
  \ sailed to a harbour in Falmouth, Han at the helm, Rose busying herself with\n\
  mooring lines and fenders.\n\nI had positioned myself in the \u201Cengine room\u201D\
  \ shifting gears from forwards to\nreverse and vice versa because of the lack of\
  \ a morse handel handle.\n\nI wasn\u2019t very good at this could and could not\
  \ hear Han shouting. ,we found out\nthat it wasn\u2019t easy to properly steer Zephon,\
  \ she ,being a boat where the\npropeller shaft is positioned off-center and does\
  \ not give any pressure on the\nrudder blade.\n\nRose left to visit her relatives\
  \ and Han stayed to share in our adventurous\nundertaking.\n\nThe weather did not\
  \ cooperate ,and with a stiff north easterly wind we, hard\ncore pensioners sailing\
  \ an unfamiliar 6 m short boat, experienced tough\ncircumstances in a wild, rough\
  \ sea.\n\nWe left Falmouth together with a Dutch, pitch black J-class yacht. She\
  \ did her\nbest to look like a submarine, waves running over deck. Very soon they\
  \ let the\nsails down, started the engine and returned to Falmouth. That provided\
  \ us the\nexcuse, without loosing face, to return to St. Just creek, a magnificent\
  \ spot\nwhere, unfortunately, I lost my wallet while hoisting a mooring buoy on\
  \ board.\n\nFor those having aspirations to dive for a fortune, I lost it close\
  \ to buoy C16.\nIt lies approximately 10 feet deep and contains enough quid to get\
  \ drunk in the\npub.\n\nWe scraped our dutch courage together and left next day\
  \ again.\n\nAt Dodman Point\u2019s our foresail was torn apart. We considered to\
  \ turn around\nprofiting from the backstay wind or round this cape using mainsail\
  \ and jib only.\nThis worked and without any further damage we arrived in Fowey\
  \ harbor. Too bad\nwe were at leeward shore with lots of wind; we could have made\
  \ it to Mevagissey\nor Charlestown if conditions had been better.\n\nPart of the\
  \ purchase deal was a typical, sturdy British dinghy; Han thought we\nshouldn\u2019\
  t leave her behind so we towed her behind Zephon. This worked out quite\nwell except\
  \ when the sea was rough and she overtook us by planing on the waves\nto be stopped\
  \ abruptly by the towing line. She even tried to jump on board\nseveral times which\
  \ started to irritate us, but after having taken care of her\nso many miles we became\
  \ a little attached to our baby. The best remedy to keep\nher in check was to incorporate\
  \ 2 rubber shock absorbers in the towing line\nclose to the dinghy.\n\nIn Studland\
  \ Bay we decided to try out our beaching legs. We cleaned up her\nbottom and had\
  \ a good look at her from a distance. She is a peculiar boat, you\nlike her or you\
  \ don\u2019t, but she is certainly a remarkable appearance.\n\nWe climbed up the\
  \ hill to find a nice pub to enjoy a good healthy bar meal. To\nour amazement 2\
  \ other old men arrived to have a beer or two and their meal but\nstill wearing\
  \ their life vests 200 meters above sea level.\n\nIn Shoreham we beached the boat\
  \ again, this time not using the legs; not on\npurpose, we left our bunks just a\
  \ little too late. We spent 4 hours anxiously\nwaiting for the boat, with her eyes\
  \ below water, to reluctantly stand upright\nagain.\n\nFrom here on the lack of\
  \ wind coming from the northeast made us use the engine a\nlot and we made good\
  \ progress. Such good progress that we decided to spend a day\nin Oostende.\n\n\
  We stayed for 2 days, as the wind had shifted to SW and had increased to Bft\n6-7,\
  \ not particularly ideal conditions for a little, 6 meter long boat. But to\nbe\
  \ honest, the Belgian beer was not bad either.\n\nWe were lucky to find MFV \u201C\
  Border Maid\u201D willing to take our dinghy along to\nHaarlem.\n\nWe were freed\
  \ from our child and happily concluded the final miles to Holland\nwith a genuine\
  \ Belgian hangover.\n\nAll in all we had a nice sailing trip of about 1500 nm of\
  \ which some 1000 up and\ndown and the remainder horizontally.\n\nZephon sails very\
  \ nicely in smooth water and steers itself, sometimes running\nmore than 5 kts.\n\
  \nWe experienced rough seas frequently, slowing us down considerably.\n\nThe engine\
  \ made us reach a speed of 2,5-3 kts. Not very fast. We went backwards\nwith the\
  \ engine in forward gear when rounding Portland Bill; the current was too\nmuch\
  \ for our little engine.\n\nMy theory to explain the engine\u2019s misbehavior is\
  \ that the propeller\u2019s pitch does\nnot match the reduction of the gear box.\n\
  \nZephon frequently aroused enthusiastic and compassionate reactions. She was\n\
  photographed for instance, resting on her beaching legs, by Mike, an Englishman,\n\
  who found us in the local pub to exchange addresses so he could send us the\npictures.\n\
  \nIn Scheveningen somebody knocked on the hatch. He brought us a couple of\nPrestige\
  \ beers. Sailors who visit Scheveningen harbor with such a beauty deserve\nto be\
  \ treated on a beer. How about that?\n\nZephon arrived safely in Enkhuizen in 2019,\
  \ ready to undergo a proper refit over\nthe winter. She was sailing again, fully\
  \ repaired in 2021.\n\nWhere does this peculiar name come from?\n\nHarrison Butler\
  \ asked his customers that bought a design from him to choose a\nname for the boat\
  \ starting out with the letter of the particular type. In\nZephon\u2019s case the\
  \ Z of Zyclon.\n\nAfter bringing her to Enkhuizen I googled the meaning of Zephon.\
  \ He (not she)\nwas an angel guarding paradise described in the Hebrew bible.\n\n\
  In retrospect, I am sure that our trip with a boat named after the \u201CGuardian\
  \ of\nParadise\u201D could not have gone wrong at all\n\nFred Schotman\n\n   \n\n"
