full_description: "<p><em>Clwyd</em> was one of ten Rivers Class Yachts built by William\
  \ Crossfield and Sons in Arnside for the River Mersey Yacht Club. Six were built\
  \ in 1912 with a further Four in 1914. Five Rivers Class yachts are thought to be\
  \ still in existence: Arnside Sailing Club\u2019s \u201CSevern\u201D 'Deva', 'Dart',\
  \ 'Styx' (all on the OGA Register) and 'Esk'.</p><p>\u201CClwyd\u201D which was\
  \ originally called \u201CKeer\u201D was built in 1914. The River Keer rises on\
  \ Docker Moor, west of Kirkby Lonsdale and enters the sea at Carnforth north of\
  \ Morecambe. For part of its course, it forms the boundary between Cumbria and Lancashire.\
  \ The first owner G.F.Law must have had some connection with the Carnforth area\
  \ to name his boat after the River Keer.</p><p>The River Class were used largely\
  \ for evening racing with a season running from May to July, with regatta race in\
  \ July. The boats were also raced in August at the Straits Regatta on Anglesey.\
  \ They were raced for prize money. In 1914 prize money was \xA344 when the average\
  \ wage was \xA367. The Royal Mersey Yacht Club was based in Rock Ferry, a then prosperous\
  \ area of Birkenhead with large houses overlooking the river. Under G.F.Law\u2019\
  s ownership Keer won one race in 1914, two in 1921 and one in 1922.</p><p>The design\
  \ was based upon the Blackpool and Fleetwood Jewel Class. The boats were originally\
  \ opened decked. They had a crew of three. The boats cost \xA350 each delivered\
  \ afloat with a further \xA314.18s for the sails. (In total \xA34000 in 2021 prices,\
  \ labour was a lot cheaper then).</p><p>In 1923 \u201CKeer\u201D was acquired by\
  \ Charles Livingston, the Vice Commodore of the Royal Mersey Club. Charles was related\
  \ to the founders of the Cunard and MacIver Lines. He was the first owner of Mersey\
  \ also included in the OGA Boat Register. \u201CKeer\u201D was renamed \u201COgwen\u201D\
  . The River Ogwen\u2019s or more correctly Afon Ogwen\u2019s source is Llyn Ogwen\
  \ in Snowdonia under the shadow of Tryfan. The River Ogwen enter the sea south of\
  \ Bangor.</p><p>In 1924 \u201COgwen\u201D was brought for \xA3104 15s 5d (\xA36500\
  \ in 2021 prices) by William Phythian Davidson, the Secretary and Treasurer of Club,\
  \ an unmarried accountant who ran the Royal Mersey from 1908 till his death in 1939.\
  \ William already owned another Rivers Class boat also built in 1914 called \u201C\
  Clwyd\u201D but generally known as the red boat. William renamed \u201COgwen\u201D\
  \ \u201CClwyd\u201D repainting her red and swapping the sails over. William sold\
  \ his old boat to the Earl of Derby. The River Clwyd is a river in North Wales that\
  \ comes out at Rhyl.</p><p>After 1926 \u201CClwyd\u201D was only raced in the Rivers\
  \ Class series in 1935.</p><p>\u201CClwyd\u201D spent the Second World War hauled\
  \ out in a field near Bootle. She was owned by Ken Colley who fitted a cabin. His\
  \ first cruise in her was to the Menai Straits with four adults sharing the cabin,\
  \ which must have been a tight fit. She seems to have been kept after the war on\
  \ the River Alt at Hightown between Liverpool and Southport. Arnside Sailing Club\u2019\
  s Severn may have been there at the same time.</p><p>By the 1960s \u201CClwyd\u201D\
  \ was on the Humber. She was advertised for sale in the Gaffers Log in 1968 by P.Austin\
  \ of Cottingham near Hull for \xA3350 (\xA36000 in 2021 prices). By this time, she\
  \ had been restored to her open deck appearance with her cabin removed, though the\
  \ advert mentioned that two people could sleep under her foredeck if required.</p><p>Clwyd\
  \ was damaged in 1970s whilst in Hull Docks by a barge that have come lose from\
  \ her moorings.</p><p>One of her owners described her as \u201CA great sail \u2013\
  \ sailed like a witch\u201D</p>"
