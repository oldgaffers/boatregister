  *Clipper 1* is a 1934 River Cruiser Class gaff sloop. Classic Norfolk Broads
  sailing boat popular as hire boats in the pre-war era.
full_description: |-
  Clipper 1 was the first of 5 “Clippers” to be built by Chumley & Hawke at
  Horning. They were designed by A L Braithwaite to the Metacentric Shelf
  principle and had a reputation for their performance and speed which was unusual
  for boats destined for a life of hire.  As with all  sailing craft of this type,
  her mast is mounted in a tabernacle and she features a lifting cabin roof, which
  is necesarry to pass under the low bridges of the Broads landscape.


  Originally built without an engine, Clipper 1 was fitted with a Stuart Turner
  engine in the 1960s which is still in use today. Having spent the majority of
  her life as a hire boat Clipper 1 is still very much how she would have been
  when originally built.
