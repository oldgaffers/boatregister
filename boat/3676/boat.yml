  *Clipper 1* is a 1934 River Cruiser Class gaff sloop. Classic Norfolk Broads
  sailing boat popular as hire boats in the pre-war era.

full_description: "Clipper 1 was the first of 5 \u201CClippers\u201D to be built by\
  \ Chumley & Hawke at\nHorning. They were designed by A L Braithwaite to the Metacentric\
  \ Shelf\nprinciple and had a reputation for their performance and speed which was\
  \ unusual\nfor boats destined for a life of hire. \_As with all \_sailing craft\
  \ of this type,\nher mast is mounted in a tabernacle and she features a lifting\
  \ cabin roof, which\nis necesarry to pass under the low bridges of the Broads landscape.\n\
  \nOriginally built without an engine, Clipper 1 was fitted with a Stuart Turner\n\
  engine in the 1960s which is still in use today. Having spent the majority of\n\
  her life as a hire boat Clipper 1 is still very much how she would have been\nwhen\
  \ originally built.\n\n"
