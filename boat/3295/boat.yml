  'Spinaway X' is an early Plymouth Hooker built in Looe in 1889.

full_description: "'Spinaway X' was built in Looe in the 1880s. She was first registered\
  \ in\nPlymouth in 1891 as PH 302. She is an early example of a Plymouth Hooker.\
  \ She\nfished out of Polperro and other West Country ports until 1949 when she was\
  \ sold\nas a yacht for the sum of \xA3185, a Willy's jeep (Teg. FDv 64) and a book\
  \ of\npetrol coupons.\n\n\nIn 1951 a survey shows she was partly decked with an\
  \ open cockpit and a 1925 1\ncylinder Bergius Co. engine. By 1958 she had a 19472\
  \ cylinder Thornecroft\nengine. In the mid 1970s she had a 20hp air cooled Lister\
  \ engine.\n\n\nIn 1979 Jim Curry refitted her including full decking, replacing\
  \ parts of the\nkeel, the stem and some replanking, tripling some frames and building\
  \ a\ncoachroof. Research at that time included a conversation with a 92 year old\
  \ gent\nwho remembered fishing on Spinaway in his youth. He had a fragile photograph\
  \ of\nher and he quoted her as being the fastest piece of wood out of Polperro.\n\
  \n\nIn 1996 Dave Blinkhorn interviewed JC Heal's son Philip and got some of the\n\
  above information. He described her as a Looe Lugger. As a yacht she has spent\n\
  time in the Irish Sea, and in Dave and Anna Blinkhorn's ownership sailed via\nScotland,\
  \ East Coast and the French Canals to the Mediterranean, ending up in\nSpain. She\
  \ sailed back to the West Country in 2004.\n\n\nIn 2016, Bob Aylott went sailing\
  \ with her owners Andrew and Angela Hitt and crew\nMike and Brian on the River Medina.\
  \ Take a look at the My Classic Boat video\nhere.\n\n\n"
