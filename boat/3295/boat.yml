  *Spinaway X* is an early Plymouth Hooker built in Looe in 1889.
full_description: |-
  *Spinaway X* was built in Looe in the 1880s. She was first registered
  in Plymouth in 1891 as PH 302. She is an early example of a Plymouth Hooker.
  She fished out of Polperro and other West Country ports until 1949 when she was
  sold as a yacht for the sum of Â£185, a Willy's jeep (Teg. FDv 64) and a book
  of petrol coupons.
   
  In 1951 a survey shows she was partly decked with an
  open cockpit and a 1925 1 cylinder Bergius Co. engine. By 1958 she had a 1947 2
  cylinder Thornecroft engine. In the mid 1970s she had a 20hp air cooled Lister
  engine.
   
  In 1979 Jim Curry refitted her including full decking, replacing
  parts of the keel, the stem and some replanking, tripling some frames and building
  a coach roof. Research at that time included a conversation with a 92 year old
  gent who remembered fishing on *Spinaway* in his youth. He had a fragile photograph
  of her and he quoted her as being the fastest piece of wood out of Polperro.

  In 1996 Dave Blinkhorn interviewed JC Heal's son Philip and got some of then
  above information. He described her as a Looe Lugger. As a yacht she has spent
  time in the Irish Sea, and in Dave and Anna Blinkhorn's ownership sailed via Scotland,
  East Coast and the French Canals to the Mediterranean, ending up in Spain. She
  sailed back to the West Country in 2004.

  In 2016, Bob Aylott went sailing with her owners Andrew and Angela Hitt and crew
  Mike and Brian on the River Medina. Take a look at the My Classic Boat video here.
