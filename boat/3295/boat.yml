short_description: <p>&#39;Spinaway X&#39; is an early Plymouth Hooker built in Looe
  in 1889.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Spinaway X&#39; was built in Looe in the 1880s. She was\
  \ first registered in Plymouth in 1891 as PH 302. She is an early example of a Plymouth\
  \ Hooker. She fished out of Polperro and other West Country ports until 1949 when\
  \ she was sold as a yacht for the sum of &pound;185, a Willy&#39;s jeep (Teg. FDv\
  \ 64) and a book of petrol coupons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1951 a survey shows she was\
  \ partly decked with an open cockpit and a 1925 1 cylinder Bergius Co. engine. By\
  \ 1958 she had a 19472 cylinder Thornecroft engine. In the mid 1970s she had a 20hp\
  \ air cooled Lister engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979 Jim Curry refitted her including\
  \ full decking, replacing parts of the keel, the stem and some replanking, tripling\
  \ some frames and building a coachroof. Research at that time included a conversation\
  \ with a 92 year old gent who remembered fishing on Spinaway in his youth. He had\
  \ a fragile photograph of her and he quoted her as being the fastest piece of wood\
  \ out of Polperro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996 Dave Blinkhorn interviewed JC Heal&#39;s\
  \ son Philip and got some of the above information. He described her as a Looe Lugger.\
  \ As a yacht she has spent time in the Irish Sea, and in Dave and Anna Blinkhorn&#39;s\
  \ ownership sailed via Scotland, East Coast and the French Canals to the Mediterranean,\
  \ ending up in Spain. She sailed back to the West Country in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ 2016, Bob Aylott went sailing with her owners Andrew and Angela Hitt and crew\
  \ Mike and Brian on the River Medina. Take a look at the My Classic Boat video here.</p>\r\
