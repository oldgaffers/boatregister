short_description: '''Hanser'' was designed and built for Nigel & Jean Willimot as
  a fast weekend sailer. Her hull is representative of the long narrow monohulls built
  for racing in the 1960s with deep high aspect ratio keel and rudder.'
full_description: "<p>&#39;Hanser&#39;s lifting keel alows the boat to sit on the\
  \ mud and navigate shoal waters under engine. She was originally rigged as a gaff\
  \ sloop and had an air cooled Ducatti diesel with a folding prop. In the right conditions\
  \ and hands she is a very fast boat. Arthur Holt thinks this was the first boat\
  \ to be fitted with a full size lifting keel of 3/4 ton, interchangeable gaff and\
  \ bermudan rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1986 she passed back into Arthur Holt&#39;s\
  \ hands - he had a Bermudan rig built for another long thin boat called &#39;Kraken&#39;\
  \ which he transferred to &#39;Hanser&#39;, moving the mast back 5&#39; onto the\
  \ coachroof. He also made a gaff main which worked on the Bermudan mast so he could\
  \ take part in OGA events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabian Bush, who trained under Arthur,\
  \ acquired the boat in 1999 and he started to change things. The engine was replaced\
  \ by an outboard and a tiny mizzen added for handling under sail. The mast was moved\
  \ back into the original position but on a tabernacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latterly she\
  \ has been sailed with a gaff main. The rudder and keel format have been altered\
  \ and more ballast added for sail carrying capacity. A short bowsprit has been added,\
  \ making the boat more of a family cruiser than a racer. A new mainsail was made\
  \ in 2013 and a deeper analysis of the boat is planned.</p>"
