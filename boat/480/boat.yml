full_description: |-
  ‘Ploughboy’ was built for John Jackson of North Scales as a replacement for
  ‘Cock of the North’, which had been wrecked on her maiden voyage from Arnside in
  December 1900. ‘Ploughboy’ is thought to have had portable side decks, which
  could be removed to enable her to qualify as an open boat improving her racing
  handicap.

  In the 1920s she may have been used for fishing. Her sail number is FD44
  (Fleetwood). In the 1930s she took part in the Fleetwood – Isle of Man Race.
  Bought in 1965 by John Gill, a housemaster at Rossall School near Fleetwood, the
  boat was used to teach sailing to boys at the school.

  ### History

  1900: John Jackson of North Scales, Walney Island who was a farmer, ferryman or
  both ordered ‘Cock of the North’ from Crossfield Brothers for £70. Having left
  Arnside in calm weather, ‘Cock of the North’ was wrecked in a gale on her maiden
  voyage. She was crewed by John Jackson and his three sons and was lost when
  entering the Walney Channel off Piel Island with tide and wind against her. All
  her crew survive unharmed.    1901: Local boatmen take a collection for a
  replacement boat. A poem is written about the ‘Cock of the North’ which is said
  to have been recited in the local theatre to raise money.    1902: John Jackson
  orders ‘Ploughboy’ as a replacement yacht. As part of the contract Crossfields
  had to deliver the boat to Walney Island.    1907: Recorded as taking part in
  both Roa Island and First Barrow Yacht Club Regattas, owned by J.Jackson. In
  this year she won the Vickerstown and North Scale Gayner Cup, which was named
  after Sir George Gayner MP by winning it three times. (1903, 1905, 1907)

  Mr Jimmy Jackson remembered crewing with his father in 'Plougboy', along with
  his elder brother Harry. Jimmy's job was to shift the ballast up to the weather
  side when racing. When one considers that the ballast consisted of 56lb weights
  one can imagine that hard work was the order of the day when beating to
  windward. On occasions 'Ploughboy' was skippered by a professional seaman from
  St Annes, and a local man by the name of Fred Woods was also known to have acted
  as helmsman during racing.    1914-5: Sold to "Dutch Jack" Verscholye, (the
  skipper of the Workington dredger), then later she was sold to Mr Ford of
  Haverigg.

  Returning to Barrow in the early 1920s she was purchased by Mr Thompson who
  modified her keel with the addition of extra weights bolted on each side.
  1920s: Recorded as taking part in Wardleys Regatta on River Wyre near Fleetwood,
  owned by J.Thompson of Ramsden Dock Road, Barrow.    1922: Recorded as taking
  part in the half decked fishing boat race at Morecambe Regatta, owned T.Thompson
  of Morecambe, suggesting use as a fishing boat.    1930 & 1931: Takes part in
  Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by R.S.Taylor (second place, 1931).

  At some point in the 1930s 'Ploughboy' was owned by Bill Kitchen, and
  international speedway and TT racer. He kept the boat at Fleetwood.

  1935 Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by H.Foote. Other
  Crossfield yachts in the race are ‘Lalla Rookh' and ‘Nanette’.

  1965: Bought by John Gill, housemaster at Rossall School, near Fleetwood. Her
  frames were found to be rotten. Mr Gill and his partner refastened the yacht
  completely and laminated 32 new oak frames and replaced several planks. A new
  deck was also fitted but the coach roof was left on, this being in perfect
  condition. ('Ploughboy' when built was not fitted with a cabin, so the coach
  roof would not be as old as the hull).

  ‘Ploughboy’ is used to teach sailing at the school. Sailed to Solway, Isle of
  Man, Menai Straits and Scottish Isles.

  1978 sold to Brian Parry and taken to Gillingham, Kent

  1996-2004 owned by Ian Ruffles, Gillingham

  2004: Bought by Robert Raynor of Knott End on the other side of the Wyre Estuary
  from Fleetwood. Under his ownership ‘Ploughboy’ competed in Liverpool Nobby
  Races. He also sailed her up to Arnside, anchoring overnight at New Barns Bay.

  2012: Bought by new owner. Kept at Gillingham in Kent.    2017: Advertised on
  Ebay for £14,500

  2021: Change of ownership and undergoing restoration in Port Penryn, Wales.

    Built Arnside 1902, a well known gaff-rigged yacht on Nobby/Morcambe bay prawner lines. 29ft LOA.
    Located in Bangor, N Wales.
    With all Sails and gear:

    -Sails.
    Main in good condition; 2-3 Stays VG-G; Roller reefing Jib Excellent; and few misc older sails inc. Topsail.

    -Mast & Rigging.
    Many wooden blocks replaced new by a previous owner.
    Original wooden mast, generally good, requires some repair by pulley for topsail.

    -Engine.
    Betamarine BD722. New in 2007. Turns over with compression. Removed from boat.

    Sails and rigging in dry storage, mast and engine stored offsite.

    Hull:
     
    Requires significant work now.
     
    Numerous frames (mainly amidships) require repaired/replaced.

    Hoodends, P/S, 5-6 up from garboard require repair. Stem good condition.
    There are also some smaller repairs to complete; P/S toe rail; P/S partial uppermost rubbing strake(?) by gunwale; P/S towing/trawling/mooring block.
    The majority of the concrete ballast has been removed and the keelson lifted out.
    A recent inspection by a shipwright detailed the following:

    ***Planking:***

    ***Overall the planking seems in reasonable condition. Iron fastening corrosion, unknown condition but planks coming loose at hood ends and around the turn of the bilge. Will most likely require removal of planking and refastening to frames.***

    ***Rot around forward ends of port side, possibly extending into the stem. Significant rot around stern post hood ends hidden behind repairs, likely to extend into stern post.***

    ***Extensive rot around counter stern fashion pieces and throughout the counter stern. Repairs made to the area require alterations to return them to original condition.***

    ***Deck:***

    ***Deck and rubbing strakes in questionable condition due to delamination of glass sheath and plywood. Very likely requiring complete removal of cabin, toe rails and deck to expose condition of structure and to allow access to internal hull repairs.***

    ***Internal hull structure:***

    ***Extensive rot and partial delamination of frames, particularly around the bilge where fresh water has been sat. Further concrete to be removed to allow access to structure. Actual condition of keel timber can only assessed after removing some planks and concrete ballast.***


    This is a well known boat with lots of history. During her 119 years she has championed in numerous races and has been much admired locally and further afield. She is well documented in various publications. I shall upload some scans in a future post.

    I've been working on this boat during weekends for the past few months with some help from friends. Due to my physical health I've decided to pass the project on.

    **She is offered free to a suitably qualified new custodian.**
