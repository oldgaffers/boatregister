full_description: "<p>\u2018Ploughboy\u2019 was built for John Jackson of North Scales\
  \ as a replacement for \u2018Cock of the North\u2019, which had been wrecked on\
  \ her maiden voyage from Arnside in December 1900. \u2018Ploughboy\u2019 is thought\
  \ to have had portable side decks, which could be removed to enable her to qualify\
  \ as an open boat improving her racing handicap.</p>\n<p>In the 1920s she may have\
  \ been used for fishing. Her sail number is FD44 (Fleetwood). In the 1930s she took\
  \ part in the Fleetwood \u2013 Isle of Man Race. Bought in 1965 by John Gill, a\
  \ housemaster at Rossall School near Fleetwood, the boat was used to teach sailing\
  \ to boys at the school.</p>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>1900: John Jackson of North Scales,\
  \ Walney Island who was a farmer, ferryman or both ordered \u2018Cock of the North\u2019\
  \ from Crossfield Brothers for \xA370. Having left Arnside in calm weather, \u2018\
  Cock of the North\u2019 was wrecked in a gale on her maiden voyage. She was crewed\
  \ by John Jackson and his three sons and was lost when entering the Walney Channel\
  \ off Piel Island with tide and wind against her. All her crew survive unharmed.<br>\n\
  1901: Local boatmen take a collection for a replacement boat. A poem is written\
  \ about the \u2018Cock of the North\u2019 which is said to have been recited in\
  \ the local theatre to raise money.<br>\n1902: John Jackson orders \u2018Ploughboy\u2019\
  \ as a replacement yacht. As part of the contract Crossfields had to deliver the\
  \ boat to Walney Island.<br>\n1907: Recorded as taking part in both Roa Island and\
  \ First Barrow Yacht Club Regattas, owned by J.Jackson. In this year she won the\
  \ Vickerstown and North Scale Gayner Cup, which was named after Sir George Gayner\
  \ MP by winning it three times. (1903, 1905, 1907)</p>\n<p>Mr Jimmy Jackson remembered\
  \ crewing with his father in 'Plougboy', along with his elder brother Harry. Jimmy's\
  \ job was to shift the ballast up to the weather side when racing. When one considers\
  \ that the ballast consisted of 56lb weights one can imagine that hard work was\
  \ the order of the day when beating to windward. On occasions 'Ploughboy' was skippered\
  \ by a professional seaman from St Annes, and a local man by the name of Fred Woods\
  \ was also known to have acted as helmsman during racing.<br>\n1914-5: Sold to \"\
  Dutch Jack\" Verscholye, (the skipper of the Workington dredger), then later she\
  \ was sold to Mr Ford of Haverigg.</p>\n<p>Returning to Barrow in the early 1920s\
  \ she was purchased by Mr Thompson who modified her keel with the addition of extra\
  \ weights bolted on each side.<br>\n1920s: Recorded as taking part in Wardleys Regatta\
  \ on River Wyre near Fleetwood, owned by J.Thompson of Ramsden Dock Road, Barrow.<br>\n\
  1922: Recorded as taking part in the half decked fishing boat race at Morecambe\
  \ Regatta, owned T.Thompson of Morecambe, suggesting use as a fishing boat.<br>\n\
  1930 &amp; 1931: Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by R.S.Taylor\
  \ (second place, 1931).</p>\n<p>at some point in the 1930s 'Ploughboy' was owned\
  \ by Bill Kitchen, and international speedway and TT racer. He kept the boat at\
  \ Fleetwood.</p>\n<p>1935 Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by\
  \ H.Foote. Other Crossfield yachts in the race are \u2018Lalla Rookh' and \u2018\
  Nanette\u2019.</p>\n<p>1965: Bought by John Gill, housemaster at Rossall School,\
  \ near Fleetwood. Her frames were found to be rotten. Mr Gill and his partner refastened\
  \ the yacht completely and laminated 32 new oak frames and replaced several planks.\
  \ A new deck was also fitted but the coach roof was left on, this being in perfect\
  \ condition. ('Ploughboy' when built was not fitted with a cabin, so the coach roof\
  \ would not be as old as the hull).</p>\n<p>\u2018Ploughboy\u2019 is used to teach\
  \ sailing at the school. Sailed to Solway, Isle of Man, Menai Straits and Scottish\
  \ Isles.</p>\n<p>1978 sold to Brian Parry and taken to Gillingham, Kent</p>\n<p>1996-2004\
  \ owned by Ian Ruffles, Gillingham</p>\n<p>2004: Bought by Robert Raynor of Knott\
  \ End on the other side of the Wyre Estuary from Fleetwood. Under his ownership\
  \ \u2018Ploughboy\u2019 competed in Liverpool Nobby Races. He also sailed her up\
  \ to Arnside, anchoring overnight at New Barns Bay.</p>\n<p>2012: Bought by new\
  \ owner. Kept at Gillingham in Kent.<br>\n2017: Advertised on Ebay for \xA314,500</p>\n\
  <p>2021: Change of ownership and undergoing restoration in Port Penryn, Wales.</p>"
