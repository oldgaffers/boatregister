short_description: <p>&#39;Mary Ellen&#39; was built in 1934 by Kidby and Sons, Brightlingsea,
  Essex. As builders of fast smacks they built her to their own design as a gentleman&#39;s
  yacht for a local farmer. Her hull takes the shape of an Essex smack, but with a
  spoon bow and transom stern. She has been cruised extensively.</p>
full_description: "<p>From 1946 - 1953 Major &#39;Spider&#39; Dale kept &#39;Mary\
  \ Ellen&#39; at Walton, selling her to Lester and Muriel Cole who sailed out of\
  \ Burnham and kept her for 20 years, sailing her to Finland in 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Michael Marbell kept her at Bosham until she changed hands again in 1980. Her\
  \ new owner, William Phillips took her to Chichester, selling her in 1987 to Charles\
  \ Vicker who kept her for three years before selling to Robert Vestentoft also of\
  \ Birdham Pool, who kept her until 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her original rig was probably\
  \ gaff but &#39;Mary Ellen&#39; was Bermudan since the war until being re-rigged\
  \ gaff in 2001 with mast by Priors and sails by Lawrence.</p>"
