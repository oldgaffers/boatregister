short_description: <p>&#39;Hyacinth&#39; was built in 1900 by Aldous of Brightlingsea,
  for the French family of Mersea. She was used for oyster dredging and remained in
  the family until the mid 1960s. She was then purchased by Clarke and Carters of
  Mersea, re-fitted and sold to Mrs. M. Kennell in 1969.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Hyacinth&#39; was one of the few smacks to have never been\
  \ un-rigged and although she had an engine installed in 1949, this was removed in\
  \ 1970. She has had notable success in racing on the East Coast. In 1951 she won\
  \ the Nova Trophy. She won the Tom Bolt Cup in 1971, 1972, 1976 and 1977.&nbsp;\
  \ She has been first boat home several times in OGA races.</p>\r\n<p>Take a look\
  \ at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to be in the\
  \ 1970s, showing her taking part in the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend\
  \ to Billingsgate, won by 'Shamrock'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\"\
