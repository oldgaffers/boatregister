  *Hyacinth* was built in 1900 by Aldous of Brightlingsea, for the French family
  of Mersea. She was used for oyster dredging and remained in the family until the
  mid 1960s. She was then purchased by Clarke and Carters of Mersea, re-fitted and
  sold to Mrs. M. Kennell in 1969.
  *Hyacinth* was one of the few smacks to have never been un-rigged and although
  she had an engine installed in 1949, this was removed in 1970. She has had
  notable success in racing on the East Coast. In 1951 she won the Nova Trophy.
  She won the Tom Bolton Cup in 1971, 1972, 1976 and 1977.Â  She has been first boat
  home several times in OGA races.

  Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to
  be in the 1970s, showing her taking part in the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race
  from Gravesend to Billingsgate, won by 'Shamrock'.
