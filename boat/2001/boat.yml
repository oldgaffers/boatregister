  *Annie* has been in the same ownership in the west of Scotland for most of her
  life.  *Annie* is in a shed at Crinan Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the
  harbour there on a swinging mooring. She is still '*Of Falmouth*' despite having
  been in Crinan for over three decades. Falmouth is the place of her birth.


  *Annie* has a very pleasant varnished pine/white painted interior, with full
  sized chart table to stbd opposite the galley, two wide quarter berths and two
  berths in the saloon. The fo'c's'le is through a door and houses the mast step
  and head, chain locker etc.

  sales_text: "*Annie* is lying ashore at Crinan, Argyll, west of Scotland, 2 hours'\
    \ drive from\nGlasgow. Survey 2024 reveals no problems. Beautiful new mainsail\
    \ by North Sea\nSails has had 3 (very) short seasons. Unique varnished pine and\
    \ white painted\ninterior. Extra-roomy forecabin/head. Recently painted deck and\
    \ fore-cabin. \n\n\nPART EXCHANGE: We wish to down-size, so would consider a smaller\
    \ boat (Mk1\nCrabber, possibly Golant Gaffer or other capable trailerable vessel)\
    \ in part\nexchange.\n\n\n*Annie* is the first of the Cornish Crabber Pilot Cutters,\
    \ sail number P1. With\nthis design Roger Dongray launched a wonderfully seaworthy\
    \ and classic-looking\nGRP gaff cutter into a market where such a thing was a\
    \ rarity. It is hard to\nname a better-looking traditional working boat design\
    \ from that time. Built in\n1985, she  was acquired from Roger Dongray by her\
    \ current family in 1989.\n\n\n*Annie* has spent the winters since 1989 in a cosy\
    \ boat shed for at least 7\nmonths of every year. Her gaff rig includes a new\
    \ mainsail. Wykeham Martin\nfurling jib and foil-reefing staysail. Her engine\
    \ is her original Volvo 18hp\ndiesel, which has never missed a beat. With a centreboard,\
    \ (draft 1.07m-1.6m)\nthis boat has to be one of the best designed modern gaffers,\
    \  - often called the\nprettiest boat in the anchorage, and a modern classic.\n\
    \n\nBelow she has two \"snug double\" quarterberths, two saloon berths, and a\
    \ full\nsized chart table to starboard, opposite the galley. Gimballed two burner\
    \ gas\ncooker with grill and oven. On the aft end of the cabin table a Taylors\
    \ paraffin\nstove keeps the crew warm and the boat dry even in the cooler Scottish\
    \ summers.\nThis has the more recent German-made burner which is very much easier\
    \ to light\nand maintain than its predecessor.\n\n\nThrough a varnished pine door\
    \ to the forecabin, the Blakes Lavac head (2018) is\noffset, unusually, to one\
    \ side, allowing a lot more space to change clothing in\nprivacy, and to get at\
    \ the chain locker forward and other stowage. Ample\nhanging/dripping space for\
    \ wet weather gear, with a small sump under the floor\nto catch the run-off.\n\
    \n\nHer interior, well lit with clear hatches above and portholes in the saloon\
    \ is\nall varnish/oil and white paint. There are heavy cotton cushion covers for\
    \ each\nbunk as well as the seagoing waterproof covers, and lee-cloths for the\
    \ saloon\nberths. Insulation under all of the berth cushions has eliminated condensation\n\
    there. S Insulation behind the bunks has proved effective also.   She has no\n\
    electronics currently but there are places  for echo, vhf and an electronic log,\n\
    with all the necessary wiring.  \n\n\n*Annie* has had wheel steering but is now\
    \ back to her original tiller. All the\ngear for the wheel is available. She has\
    \ fisherman and cqr anchors on heavy\nchain, and an electric windlass. Her tabernacle-stepped\
    \ mast and the spars are\nmaintained with Sikkens Cetol. Our own mix of dark red,\
    \ and green paint has\nreplaced most of the varnished brightwork on the coamings\
    \ around the large\ncockpit and on rubbing strake and toe rail, making maintenance\
    \ easier and\nbringing her back to her working boat roots. Her glass sheathed\
    \ plywood deck was\nrepainted after careful preparation in 2024. All guard-rail\
    \ stanchions have been\nre-bedded 2023/24. \n\n\n*Annie* is a boat that looks\
    \ after her crew, and with her easy motion and\nversatile gaff rig would make\
    \ a fantastic cruising home. After a whole winter,\nor even just an hour ashore,\
    \ her crew always look forward to returning aboard. \n\n\nAfter 35 years with\
    \ her in the family, we have reluctantly decided to down-size.\nWe would consider\
    \ a part-exchange for a Mk1 Crabber, a Golant Gaffer, or any\nother capable, attractive\
    \ and preferably trailerable cruising boat.   ANNIE is\ncurrently lying ashore\
    \ on the west of Scotland. The plan to sail her round to\nthe Clyde for the winter\
    \ 24/25 was thwarted by Ashley.  Crinan is only 2 hours'\ndrive from Glasgow.\
    \ We will help in any way we can with lifts from Glasgow for\nanyone wishing to\
    \ view the boat if travelling far by public transport."
