  *Annie* has been in the same ownership in the west of Scotland for most of her
  life.  *Annie* is in a shed at Crinan Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the
  harbour there on a swinging mooring. She is still '*Of Falmouth*' despite having
  been in Crinan for over three decades. Falmouth is the place of her birth.

  *Annie* has a very pleasant varnished pine/white painted interior, with full
  sized chart table to stbd opposite the galley, two wide quarter berths and two
  berths in the saloon. The fo'c's'le is through a door and houses the mast step
  and head, chain locker etc.

    *Annie* is lying ashore at Crinan, Argyll, west of Scotland, 2 hours'
     drive from Glasgow. Survey 2024 reveals no problems. Beautiful new 
     mainsail by North Sea\nSails has had 3 (very) short seasons. Unique varnished pine and
     white painted\ninterior. Extra-roomy forecabin/head. Recently painted deck and
     fore-cabin. 
     PART EXCHANGE: We wish to down-size, so would consider a smaller boat
     (Mk1 Crabber, possibly Golant Gaffer or other capable trailerable vessel)
     In part exchange. *Annie* is the first of the Cornish Crabber Pilot Cutters,
     sail number P1. With\nthis design Roger Dongray launched a wonderfully seaworthy
     and classic-looking\nGRP gaff cutter into a market where such a thing was a
     rarity. It is hard to\nname a better-looking traditional working boat design
     from that time. Built in 1985, she  was acquired from Roger Dongray by her
     current family in 1989.
     
     *Annie* has spent the winters since 1989 in a cosy boat shed for at least 7
     months of every year. Her gaff rig includes a new mainsail. Wykeham Martin
     furling jib and foil-reefing staysail. Her engine is her original Volvo 18hp
     diesel, which has never missed a beat. With a centreboard, (draft 1.07m-1.6m)
     this boat has to be one of the best designed modern gaffers,- often called 
     the prettiest boat in the anchorage, and a modern classic.
     
     Below she has two snug double quarterberths, two saloon berths, and a full
     sized chart table to starboard, opposite the galley. Gimballed two burner
     gas cooker with grill and oven. On the aft end of the cabin table a Taylors
     paraffin stove keeps the crew warm and the boat dry even in the cooler Scottish
     summers. This has the more recent German-made burner which is very much easier
     to light and maintain than its predecessor.
     Through a varnished pine door to the forecabin, the Blakes Lavac head (2018) is
     offset, unusually, to one side, allowing a lot more space to change clothing in
     privacy, and to get at the chain locker forward and other stowage. Ample
     hanging/dripping space for wet weather gear, with a small sump under the floor
     to catch the run-off.
     
     Her interior, well lit with clear hatches above and portholes in the saloonis
     all varnish/oil and white paint. There are heavy cotton cushion covers for
     each bunk as well as the seagoing waterproof covers, and lee-cloths for the
     saloon berths. Insulation under all of the berth cushions has eliminated condensation
     there. Insulation behind the bunks has proved effective also.
     She has no electronics currently but there are places  for echo, vhf and an electronic log,
     with all the necessary wiring. 
     
     *Annie* has had wheel steering but is now back to her original tiller. All the
     gear for the wheel is available. She has fisherman and cqr anchors on heavy
     chain, and an electric windlass. Her tabernacle-stepped mast and the spars
     are maintained with Sikkens Cetol. Our own mix of dark red, and green paint
     has replaced most of the varnished brightwork on the coamings around the large
     cockpit and on rubbing strake and toe rail, making maintenance easier and
     bringing her back to her working boat roots. Her glass sheathed plywood deck 
     was repainted after careful preparation in 2024. All guard-rail stanchions have
     been re-bedded 2023/24.
     *Annie* is a boat that looks after her crew, and with her easy motion and
     versatile gaff rig would make a fantastic cruising home. After a whole winter,
     or even just an hour ashore, her crew always look forward to returning aboard.
     
     After 35 years with her in the family, we have reluctantly decided to down-size.
     We would consider a part-exchange for a Mk1 Crabber, a Golant Gaffer, or any
     other capable, attractive and preferably trailerable cruising boat. 
     
     *Annie* is currently lying ashore on the west of Scotland. The plan to sail her round 
     to the Clyde for the winter 24/25 was thwarted by storm Ashley. Crinan is only 2 hours
     drive from Glasgow. We will help in any way we can with lifts from Glasgow for anyone 
     wishing to view the boat if travelling far by public transport.
