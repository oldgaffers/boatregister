short_description: <p>Annie is the first Pilot Cutter taken from the mould.</p>
full_description: <p>Annie has been in the same ownership in the west of Scotland
  for most of her life. In 2018 we converted her to a junk rig, placing her new unstayed
  Douglas fir mast right up forward to a step in the fo'c's'le. The boat's handling
  is completely transformed. She works like a dinghy and looks not unlike a Loch Fyne
  Skiff. We sail, and enjoy sailing, so much more than before - because reefing is
  so easy, we sail her with the optimum sail up and get the most out of her wonderful
  hull and balance in this way. We have retained her gaff rig and all serviceable
  parts, including a brand new mainsail by Steve Hall, North Sea Sails. I could convert
  her back again in short order for anyone who wishes it. Annie is in a shed at Crinan
  Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the harbour there on a swinging mooring.
  She is still 'Of Falmouth' despite having been in Crinan for over three decades.
  Falmouth is the place of her birth.</p><p>Annie has a very pleasant varnished pine/white
  painted interior, with full sized chart table to stbd opposite the galley, two wide
  quarter berths and two berths in the saloon. The fo'c's'le is through a door and
  houses the mast step and head, chain locker etc.</p>
