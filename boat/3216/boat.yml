full_description: "<p>&#39;Trasnagh&#39; an Island One Design by Alfred Mylne, was\
  \ discovered as a bare hull by Ian Terblanche, who painstakingly restored her with\
  \ the help from broker Peter Gregson and local boatbuilders Pete Nash and Brian\
  \ Pomeroy. They achieved a high level of well researched authenticity. Teak decks\
  \ were laid after seeing a photograph of her winning the King George Cup in 1927.\
  \ Having been converted to Bermudan at some time during her earlier cruising and\
  \ racing days, her original gaff rig has been restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Trasnagh&#39;\
  \ won second place in the Classic Boat Restoration of the Year Award, 2014.</p>"
