    Leonid: free to a good home; a restoration project.     An 18’ gunter-rigged
    3/4-decked day sailer, clinker-built of larch on oak by J. Hinks & Sons of
    Appledore in the mid-fifties, this fine boat was given me a few years ago to
    make room for something else. I have replaced most of the ribs that needed
    doing, ditto planking including one of the garboards. She has a 3”x 3” full
    length iron keel slotted for her centre-plate. All her douglas spars are in
    excellent condition, and she has a full set of rigging, also a suit of sails
    which fit her, though probably made for a different boat originally. All-up
    weight between 1/2 and 3/4 ton, at present lying under cover as shown in West
    Somerset.
