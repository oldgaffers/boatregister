full_description: "<p>Tommy Bolton bought Maria in 1961 after she had been lying sunk\
  \ in a creek at Tollesbury for about six years. In cleaning her out he removed ten\
  \ gallons of live eels. He rigged her as a schooner and took part in the first OGA\
  \ East Coast Race, 1963. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/colmolaoi/with/14394546619\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Visit Colm&#39;s photostream on Flickr</a> for photos of the\
  \ East Coast Race, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After spending some time in the Netherlands\
  \ as a live aboard, Maria returned to Essex for a full re-build in 2004. Re-launched\
  \ in 2007, she won the Classic Boat Restoration of the Year Award in 2008.</p>\r\
