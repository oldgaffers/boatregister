  Tommy Bolton bought Maria in 1961 after she had been lying sunk in a creek at
  Tollesbury for about six years. In cleaning her out he removed ten gallons of
  live eels. He rigged her as a schooner and took part in the first OGA East Coast
  Race, 1963. [Visit Colm's photostream on

  the East Coast Race, 2014.


  After spending some time in the Netherlands as a live aboard, Maria returned to
  Essex for a full re-build in 2004. Re-launched in 2007, she won the Classic Boat
  Restoration of the Year Award in 2008.
