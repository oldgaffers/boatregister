  A Yarmouth 23, launched in 2001, 'Freya' was taken by road to Monfalcone at the
  top of the Adriatic in 2011, and sailed down the Croatian coast to Corfu. She
  stayed there until 2014, cruising around the Ionian, before returning home to
  live in Cornwall. She was little used since then, but maintained in good
  condition and 2018 was sold to a new owner in the Netherlands.
