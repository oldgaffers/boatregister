  \ Feather shares memories of the return to Dunkirk in 2000.<br>\n <del>&nbsp;</del><br>\n\
  \ First published in Gaffers Log no. 86, Mar 2015</h4>\n<blockquote>We rescued and\
  \ rebuilt \"Letitia\" in time for the Return to Dunkirk, 2000. It was the last official\
  \ return for many veterans, and so was an important one. We were lucky to meet up\
  \ with the Dench family, who originally built and sailed the boat, and named her\
  \ after Letitia Dench, a beautiful lady who was the one time carnival and \"cockle\
  \ queen<del>\u2019</del>\u2019 of Leigh-on Sea. The Dench family asked us to lay\
  \ a wreath at Dunkirk for all the Leigh-on-Sea sailors who went over in 1940. We\
  \ were very happy to do so during the memorial ceremony in the waters off Dunkirk,\
  \ accompanied on board by two petty officers of the the naval escort vessel \"HMS\
  \ Somerset<del>\u2019</del>\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We also met a veteran,\
  \ Ben Kear, a stretcher bearer who was picked up off the Dunkirk beach in 1940 by\
  \ a cockle boat, after he had carried to safety many of the wounded. Ben spent some\
  \ time on board with us telling his story of the chaotic retreat to the beaches.\
  \ I later sent Ben a photo of the wreath laying and he replied that it meant so\
  \ much to him to be able to put to rest many sad memories of those tragic days.</blockquote>\n\
  <blockquote>There was a lot more that happened: an eventful crossing, dodging bad\
  \ weather and the Channel shipping. It was quite tricky for our naval escort to\
  \ organise and shepherd a flotilla which stretched out for easily a quarter of a\
  \ mile. There was an enormous welcome at Dunkirk, with cheering crowds all along\
  \ the docks and ships<del>\u2019</del>\u2019 sirens hooting; several mega-parties\
  \ and rather too much booze. We were boarded by a mass of bagpipe-players and we\
  \ mingled with crowds of sightseers and celebrities in Dunkirk docks. It was also\
  \ strange to see the very many French and English historical re-enactors dressed\
  \ for the occasion, meeting, talking with and honouring the real veterans. The Dunkirk\
  \ people regard the \"Little Ships<del>\u2019</del>\u2019 as their little ships\
  \ and asked us to return again and again. It was a trip we will never forget.</blockquote>"
