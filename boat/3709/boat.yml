    I have upgraded from my Falmouth Bass Boat 16 (FBB16) to a Hunter Liberty 23 and
    though it saddens me, I am selling my Gunter rigged FBB16. Hull no 370. An
    excellent boat that is easily handled solo. Can be used as a day sailor, for
    taking the family up a canal or coastal, and is set up for fishing. An excellent
    all-rounder. Very easy to tow, with a displacement of about 300kg. For a
    detailed report on the boat, PM me.

    Besides the standard setup:

    1. SSR registered
    2. Built-in buoyancy, so the boat is unsinkable.

    4. Outboard
    5. Sails,
    6. Oars,
    7. Fresh anti-foul

    sockets

    10. Backup 20A controller
    11. 20w bilge pump
    12. Previous hand bilge pump included if wanted to refit.
    13. 12v LED Spotlights
    14. Easily removable splash deck
    15. fishing rod holders
    16. winter cover
    17. Mast up cover I have never used and can't comment on, as came with the boat.
    18. Road and launch trailer. Fully roller'd, so you can recover from dried out.
    19. New winch ribbon replaced May 2023
    20. Garmin Striker 4 fish finder, which includes sonar depth warnings and
    waypoints.
    21. Compass

    28. Replaced sheets etc.
