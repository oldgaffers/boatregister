short_description: <p>This is one of several boats called &#39;Odd Times&#39;, all
  with a tale to be told.</p>
full_description: "<p>Her first owner, Peter Rose, cruised &#39;Odd Times&#39; across\
  \ the Atlantic to the West Indies and up the Eastern Seaboard of the USA, New York,\
  \ Buffalo, Chicago and Mississippi before returning to Britain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This\
  \ was Peter Rose&#39;s second Atlantic crossing. His earlier passage was in another\
  \ boat named &#39;Odd Times&#39;, designed by John Leather and built for him in\
  \ 1958. He sailed her from his native Essex coast to the Aegean and from Scotland\
  \ to the Caribbbean, reaching Barbados in January 1966. He cruised the east coast\
  \ of the USA as far as Iversterly, Rhode Island. The planned return voyage to England\
  \ in 1967 ended in disaster and the loss of &#39;Odd Times&#39; whilst under tow.\
  \ The story is told in &#39;Sunk Without Trace: 30 dramatic accounts of yachts lost\
  \ at sea&#39; by Paul Gelder. <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IyD0Ym8qrwsC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;dq=odd+times+yacht&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MS1TZfUpy3&amp;sig=BQRXyxLyaFrSkoRL0PhD3R3k54I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu3tKtzc3LAhWDRBQKHRV3AqIQ6AEIMzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=odd%20times%20yacht&amp;f=false\"\
