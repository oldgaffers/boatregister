  Phyllis is the only example of the Royal Mersey Restricted Class currently
  afloat.
full_description: |-
  The Royal Mersey Restricted Class originated in 1906 and the first example was
  Avis designed by GH Wilmer using a hull form based on the very successful
  Lancashire nobby fishing boats. Phyllis was commissioned by FW Whitely, a
  longstanding member of the RMYC and a restricted class yachtsman. She was
  designed by GH Wilmer and completed in June 1913 at Sam Bond's yard in
  Rockferry. Phylis is built to the RMRC envelope specification but with a
  slightly shorter length, a slightly heavier build and a deeper keel. FW Whitely
  is said to have sailed her directly to Hibre Island where his family still keep
  a summer cottage today.
