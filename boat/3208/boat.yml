short_description: Phyllis is the only example of the Royal Mersey Restricted Class
  currently afloat.
full_description: The Royal Mersey Restricted Class originated in 1906 and the first
  example was Avis designed by GH Wilmer using a hull form based on the very successful
  Lancashire nobby fishing boats. Phyllis was commissioned by FW Whitely, a longstanding
  member of the RMYC and a restricted class yachtsman. She was designed by GH Wilmer
  and completed in June 1913 at Sam Bond's yard in Rockferry. Phylis is built to the
  RMRC envelope specification but with a slightly shorter length, a slightly heavier
  build and a deeper keel. FW Whitely is said to have sailed her directly to Hibre
  Island where his family still keep a summer cottage today.
