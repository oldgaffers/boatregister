full_description: "<p>Harrison Butler was a well-known amateur designer at the time&nbsp;who&nbsp;championed\
  \ the metacentric theory. He aimed for balance and boats that sailed themselves.\
  \ When it came to his own boat, he selected the Davinka design and confusingly named\
  \ her &#39;Vindilis&#39; (as this was the name of another of his designs).</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Moody&rsquo;s had decided to expand their repair business into yacht building.\
  \ When he heard this, Harrison Butler placed an order for the first boat.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>&#39;Vindilis&#39; is the first Moody. Her sister ship &#39;Lindy 2&#39;\
  \ was build number 3 and is also berthed in Emsworth Yacht Harbour. &#39;Lindy&#39;\
  \ still has her original rig but the previous owner&nbsp;converted &#39;Vindilis&#39;\
  \ to a cutter and she has been left in this form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harrison Butler\
  \ contributed at least two articles to Yachting Monthly in 1935 and 1936. One of\
  \ these compares the performance of &#39;Vindilis&#39; with a Bermudan yawl rig\
  \ against his previous gaffer &#39;Sandook&#39; (unsurprisingly, faster upwind but\
  \ downwind the gaffer had the edge). This article reflected much of the debate at\
  \ the time regarding the new Bermudan. In another article, a cruise through the\
  \ Naval Review of 1937 is described with battleships moored the length of the Solent.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>The previous two owners based &#39;Vindilis&#39; on the Clyde. She returned\
  \ to the South Coast for the 2010 season under Richard &amp; Helen Farmer&#39;s\
  \ ownership.</p>"
