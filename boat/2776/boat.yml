full_description: "<p>&#39;Egret&#39; is a Highlander 18 designed by <a href=\"http://www.selway-fisher.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Selway Fisher Design</a> and featured on their website. The\
  \ Highlanders are a primarily dayboat range, though the smallest is pehaps closer\
  \ to dinghy and the largest ia weekender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was built by two sailing\
  \ enthusiasts who are high quality woodworkers, specialising mostly in church fitting,\
  \ so she was built well and beautifully. She&#39;s wood-epoxy, mostly in ply and\
  \ painted with `Perfection 709&#39;, but with the brightwork mostly in solid timber.\
  \ To get an idea of the standard, have a look at the `barleytwist&#39; mast support\
  \ inside the cuddy and the thwart,&nbsp; carved and inlaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;standard&#39;\
  \ Highlander design uses a spritsail rig, but it also has lugger and gunter variations\
  \ of which &#39;Egret&#39; uses the latter variation. Egret&#39;s internal layout\
  \ has also been extensively adapted from the original design by the use of a different\
  \ locker top construction and pumped ballast tanks rather than the standard self-filling\
  \ and emptying design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cuddy really is just that and no more on\
  \ the Highlander 18, so this really is an open boat. Only the 19&#39;6&quot; version\
  \ that has a true (small) cabin. On &#39;Egret&#39;, the builders decided to reduce\
  \ the cuddy a little more, and then &#39;overcompensate&#39;, by adding a very generous\
  \ spray hood that together with the cuddy encloses quite a long space, nearly half\
  \ the length of the cockpit. Plenty long enough for camping and the &#39;zip in\
  \ back&#39; gives a good volume and passable privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also has\
  \ a cockpit tent with&nbsp;full sitting headroom over the whole cockpit area. Startlingly\
  \ spacious and quite cosy, it&#39;s a good solid canvas tent, proofed and fairly\
  \ easy to set. Both spray hood and tent are arch-topped, rather than over-boom,\
  \ to ensure good headroom. The sides on the tent may each be rolled up, as may be\
  \ the after panel, giving plenty of ventilation options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has loads\
  \ of locker space along both side seats and across the centre of the cuddy. One,\
  \ to starboard, contains a Porta-Potti. The extreme fore-peak and extreme stern\
  \ comprise sealed boyancy tanks, so she has buoyancy aplenty. Ballast is 400lb of\
  \ water stored in a centreline tank. The design calls for fill and empty holes,\
  \ but the builders preferred to pump the water in and out, so she has twin diaphragm-type\
  \ pumps that can be either fill/empty the tanks, or both can bale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\
  \ father and son who built her did a superb job. The scantlings were all increased\
  \ a little and all the epoxy fillets are pretty much perfect. Even the reinforcing\
  \ pads (for everything) are filleted and sanded smooth. Wow! It was their idea to\
  \ make the cuddy a little smaller and fit a large generous spray-hood. Good move!</p>"
