  Minnie has been largely 'based' on the East Coast although, as intended, she has
  been trailed all over the UK, completing a UK circumnavigation 2013-2018
  (previous owners). A little tired 2022, but being tidied...

full_description: "The Cape Cutter 19 is an interesting take on the 'pocket grp gaffer'\
  \ epitomised\nby the Shrimper. \_The large rig gives good performance in light airs\
  \ and the\nboats seaworthiness has been been proven.\n\n\nMinnie completed a UK\
  \ circumnavigation between 2013 and 2018. Read about it on\nthe [Cape Cutter Association\n\
  website](http://capecutter19association.org/minnies-circumnavigation-of-britain/).\_\
  \n\n\nAfter a spell in Chichester Harbour, where she was briefly known as 'Thistle',\n\
  Minnie returned to the East Coast at the end of 2021.\n\n"
