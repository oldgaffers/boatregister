short_description: <p>Minnie has been largely 'based' on the East Coast although,
  as intended, she has been trailed all over the UK, completing a UK circumnavigation
  2013-2018 (previous owners). A little tired 2022, but being tidied...</p>
full_description: '<p>The Cape Cutter 19 is an interesting take on the ''pocket grp
  gaffer'' epitomised by the Shrimper. &nbsp;The large rig gives good performance
  in light airs and the boats seaworthiness has been been proven.</p>

  <p>Minnie completed a UK circumnavigation between 2013 and 2018. Read about it on
  the <a href="http://capecutter19association.org/minnies-circumnavigation-of-britain/"
  class="jss26">Cape Cutter Association website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>After a spell in Chichester Harbour, where she was briefly known as ''Thistle'',
  Minnie returned to the East Coast at the end of 2021.</p>'
