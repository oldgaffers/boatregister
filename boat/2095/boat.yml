short_description: |-
  Built by Peter Harris at Rowhedge in 1864, Pioneer was originally 57 ft. overall
  length working out of Brightlingsea dredging deep sea oysters. Lengthened by
  Aldous in 1889, and having a "wet well", she's probably the last remaining UK
  sailing fishing vessel with one.
full_description: |-
  Restored over six years by the Pioneer Sailing Trust, who started the project
  1998, Pioneer is now fully fitted out for sail training.


  She worked as a sailing fishing vessel off the coasts of the Netherlands and
  English East Coast from 1864 until 1929 when her first engine was fitted. In
  1939 she was decommissioned and became a houseboat at East Mersea, Essex. During
  the war, 1942, she was towed to the Strood Channel at West Mersea but broke her
  moorings and sank.
