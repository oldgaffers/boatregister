short_description: Built by Peter Harris at Rowhedge in 1864, Pioneer was originally
  57 ft. overall length working out of Brightlingsea dredging deep sea oysters. Lengthened
  by Aldous in 1889, and having a "wet well", she's probably the last remaining UK
  sailing fishing vessel with one.
full_description: "<p>Restored over six years by the Pioneer Sailing Trust, who started\
  \ the project 1998, Pioneer is now fully fitted out for sail training.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>She worked as a sailing fishing vessel off the coasts of the Netherlands and\
  \ English East Coast from 1864 until 1929 when her first engine was fitted. In 1939\
  \ she was decommissioned and became a houseboat at East Mersea, Essex. During the\
  \ war, 1942, she was towed to the Strood Channel at West Mersea but broke her moorings\
  \ and sank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pioneerck18.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\
