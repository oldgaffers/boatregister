full_description: |-
  Traditionally a Scow has had only a mainsail and this is a requirement when
  racing single-handed. The Lymington River Scow Class Rules, however, allow a jib
  to be used when racing with a crew and, if the combined weight of the helm and
  crew exceeds 22 stone (140 kgs), a spinnaker is also allowed. Anna 2 has a 1sq m
  jib, and a 6.5 sq m spinnaker
