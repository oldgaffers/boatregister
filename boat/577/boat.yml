    *Tidebird* has been regularly maintained and routine repairs carried out during
    our lengthy ownership, including stripping hull back to bare wood and repainting
    in full. She is under cover and in a ventilated yard shelter, having been ashore
    for some time due to family/health matters.  Some seasonal maintainance /repairs
    will be required, but this is very much a reluctant sale due to necessity,
    rather than choice.     She is a very sturdy well built craft, with good sailing
    qualities-and has been a huge pleasure to look after and sail.
