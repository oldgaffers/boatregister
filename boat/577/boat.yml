    *Tidebird* has been regularly maintained and routine repairs carried out during
    our lengthy ownership, including stripping hull back to bare wood and repainting
    in full.   She is under cover and in a ventilated yard shelter, having been
    ashore for some time due to family/health matters. 
    Some seasonal maintainance /repairs will be required, but this is very much a reluctant sale
    due to necessity, rather than choice.   
    She is a very sturdy well built craft, with good sailing qualities-and has been a huge pleasure to look after and sail.
