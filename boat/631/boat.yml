short_description: |-
  One of three boats called Gadfly built for Mr H.C Doughty of Margate, who
  originally owned Gadfly in 1939. Her present owner is giving Mai Star II a long
  restoration ashore.
full_description: |-
  Simon Papendick has researched Mai Star II's history from 1939 until 1973 when
  it goes off the radar until 1985. If anyone can help fill in the missing years,
  please get in touch. It seems likely that the boat was started in 1939, but not
  launched until the Spring of 1946, after the Second World War, under the name
  'Gadfly II', for her owner Mr H C Doughty of Margate, who is likely to have
  owned her sister ship 'Gadfly I' before the war.


  Following an extensive restoration and refit to replace some damaged planking
  and ribs, as well as having a new cabin sides and roof made and fitted over the
  winter 2014/2015 and the winter/spring of 2016, current owner, Simon Papendick
  is continuing Mai Star II restoration along side his other Restoration project
  on his James Silver “Western Isles” Motorsailer.
