short_description: <p>One of three boats called Gadfly built for Mr H.C Doughty of
  Margate, who originally owned Gadfly in 1939. Her owner finished a long restoration
  ashore in September 2015 and completed her afloat over the winter months.</p>
full_description: <p>Simon Papendick has researched Mai Star II's history from 1939
  until 1973 when it goes off the radar until 1985. If anyone can help fill in the
  missing years, please get in touch. It seems likely that the boat was started in
  1939, but not launched until the Spring of 1946, after the Second World War, under
  the name 'Gadfly II', for her owner Mr H C Doughty of Margate, who is likely to
  have owned her sister ship 'Gadfly I' before the war.</p><p>Following an extensive
  restoration and refit to replace some damaged planking and ribs, as well as having
  a new cabin sides and roof made and fitted over the winter 2014/2015 and the winter/spring
  of 2016, current owner, Simon Papendick got her back in the water late 2015 and
  sailing again in 2016.</p>
