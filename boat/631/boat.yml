  restoration ashore.

full_description: "Simon Papendick has researched Mai Star II's history from 1939\
  \ until 1973 when\nit goes off the radar until 1985. If anyone can help fill in\
  \ the missing years,\nplease get in touch. It seems likely that the boat was started\
  \ in 1939, but not\nlaunched until the Spring of 1946, after the Second World War,\
  \ under the name\n'Gadfly II', for her owner Mr H C Doughty of Margate, who is likely\
  \ to have\nowned her sister ship 'Gadfly I' before the war.\n\nFollowing an extensive\
  \ restoration and refit to replace some damaged planking\nand ribs, as well as having\
  \ a new cabin sides and roof made and fitted over the\nwinter 2014/2015 and the\
  \ winter/spring of 2016, current owner, Simon Papendick\nis continuing Mai Star\
  \ II restoration along side his other Restoration project\non his James Silver \u201C\
  Western Isles\u201D Motorsailer.\n\n"
