full_description: "<p>&#39;Gracie&#39; is one of the well-known racing smacks of the\
  \ East Coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a report by Jon Wainwright in the OGA Newsletter\
  \ 1987/4 (forerunner to the Gaffers Log), &#39;Gracie&#39; won the Tendring Coast\
  \ passage race at the end of August, 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Possibly because\
  \ of the unsociable hour, possibly because of the appalling weather of preceding\
  \ days, this race was poorly attended. Only the smack &#39;Gracie&#39; was about\
  \ when Arthur fired his starting gun (live amo too!) &#39;Seahorse&#39; was ten\
  \ minutes late, and the association secretary chose to ground in Tollesbury leavings.\
  \ The race was fraught with light airs, involving much tactical kedging. &#39;Chittabob\
  \ IV&#39; was first round, as expected, having taken nearly ten hours to do the\
  \ 35 mile course, but on handicap &#39;Gracie&#39; took the winner&#39;s spot, being\
  \ only 15 minutes astern of the ECOD.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at this\
  \ archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to be in the 1970s, showing\
  \ &#39;Gracie&#39; taking part in the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend\
  \ to Billingsgate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"\
