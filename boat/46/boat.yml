short_description: <p>&#39;Gracie&#39; spent her first 20 years off Clacton Beach,
  and was registered in 1910 to fish CK81. She worked out of Brightlingsea and Mersea
  and in 1934 was registered MN22. She moved to Maldon where she was decked in and
  1947 found her registered as CK46.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Gracie&#39; is one of the well-known racing smacks of the\
  \ East Coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a report by Jon Wainwright in the OGA Newsletter\
  \ 1987/4 (forerunner to the Gaffers Log), &#39;Gracie&#39; won the Tendring Coast\
  \ passage race at the end of August, 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Possibly because\
  \ of the unsociable hour, possibly because of the appalling weather of preceding\
  \ days, this race was poorly attended. Only the smack &#39;Gracie&#39; was about\
  \ when Arthur fired his starting gun (live amo too!) &#39;Seahorse&#39; was ten\
  \ minutes late, and the association secretary chose to ground in Tollesbury leavings.\
  \ The race was fraught with light airs, involving much tactical kedging. &#39;Chittabob\
  \ IV&#39; was first round, as expected, having taken nearly ten hours to do the\
  \ 35 mile course, but on handicap &#39;Gracie&#39; took the winner&#39;s spot, being\
  \ only 15 minutes astern of the ECOD.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at this\
  \ archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to be in the 1970s, showing\
  \ &#39;Gracie&#39; taking part in the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend\
  \ to Billingsgate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"\
