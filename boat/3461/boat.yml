short_description: "Aeolus is one of several (7?) 30 Square Metres built after Reimers\
  \ death in 1986, by Jansson and Zarins in Koping, Sweden, to the lines of his last\
  \ 30Sq.m design Natt och Dag (1972). She is of composite construction \u2013 the\
  \ hull is foam sandwich in epoxy and glass - the deck is cold moulded with a teak\
  \ coachroof and cockpit."
full_description: "The \u201CSquare Metre\u201D rule was widely adopted in Baltic/Scandinavian\
  \ countries from 1908 and promoted at the various international meetings trying\
  \ to agree on yacht design rules, by Johann Anker amongst others.  Knud Reimers\
  \ was an apprentice of Henry Rasmussen and started designing yachts in his own practice\
  \ from 1930  and designed his first 30 Sq.m in 1934. One of which (Water Witch)\
  \ was built in Cowes by Uffa Fox. He was well known for his Metre and Square Metre\
  \ rule boats, but his most famous design was the Tumlare.  Over the years Reimers\
  \ developed his 30 Sq.m design culminating in his last one in 1972 - SWE 222 \u201C\
  Natt och Dag\u201D. Aeolus is one of several (7?) built after Reimers death in 1986,\
  \ by Jansson and Zarins in Koping, Sweden, to the lines of Natt och Dag. She is\
  \ of composite construction \u2013 the hull is foam sandwich in epoxy and glass\
  \ - the deck is cold moulded with a teak coachroof and cockpit.  Aeolus represents\
  \ a significant stage in yacht design history and a pedigree in a class renowned\
  \ for elegance and speed. In 2008 at the 100 year Jubilee regatta for Square meter\
  \ yachts in Sweden, in the 30 Sq.m class (of 39 entries) Aeolus came 12th , SWE222\
  \ came 4th and SWE225 (one of the 7 sisterships of Aeolus) came 3rd overall.  It\
  \ has been necessary to do significant repair work at Elephant boatyard which has\
  \ rescued her from inevitable decline and she is now ready to provide elegant racing\
  \ into the future."
