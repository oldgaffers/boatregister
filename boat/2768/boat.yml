  sales_text: '<p>"Sepia" is a Memory 19, a pristine example of the cabin version
    of this popular, attractive class of gaff-rigged yachts. She was built by Salterns
    boatbuilders in 2004 and has been well loved, cruised and successfully raced by
    current owners in a range of events including those attracting classic yachts.
    These boats have a reputation for fast sailing.</p><p>Length on deck 5.8 metres
    (19 feet)<br />Length over spars 7 metres (23 feet)<br />Beam 2.1 metres (7 feet)<br
    />Draught 0.53 metres plate up, 1.10 metres plate down (2’9" / 3’7")</p><p>She
    is an ideal weekender with easy maintenance and can be trailed allowing for winter
    storage or different cruising areas. "Sepia" benefits from a lifting centreplate
    allowing for creek crawling.</p><p>The hull and deck are GRP. The hull below waterline
    was epoxied from new. The hull is a light grey, and the deck is cream. There are
    built-in buoyancy tanks under the berths in the cabin and under the seats in the
    spacious cockpit. There is ample storage under the side decks and in a large lazarette
    underneath the aft deck. There is additional storage within the cabin.</p><p>The
    cabin sides, cockpit combing and seats are in solid teak, and have been treated
    with `Semco’ for easy maintenance.</p><p>The cabin has 2 long berths with cushions,
    `Origo’ spirit hob, water tank, washing up bowl and gimballed oil lamp.</p><p>"Sepia"
    has a 6hp Tohatsu outboard in a well. This has been fully serviced and winterised
    annually. There is a separate fuel tank under the cockpit sole.</p><p>Spars made
    by Collars in Douglas fir are varnished: Keel stepped mast, boom, gaff, bowsprit.&nbsp;Topsail
    spars are aluminium. All stainless steel standing rigging was replaced in 2013.
