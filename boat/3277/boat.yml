short_description: |-
  'Rock of Ages' is an ex-inshore fishing boat with resemblance to Sheringham
  Beach Boats and Lifeboats, colloquailly described as a 'Shannocker'.
full_description: |-
  'Rock of Ages' was commissioned by one of the many fishermen who moved from
  Sheringham to Grimsby and was designed and built in Boston, Lincolnshire by
  Gostelow.


  She fished out of Grimsby, crabbing and catching bait for the larger trawlers,
  along with the 'Preseverance', 'Providence' and 'Unity' (all built by Gostelow)
  until the 1960s.


  She was rebuilt in the 1980s and raced on the Humber by Eric Hammond.


  She has been undergoing a major restoration ashore on the River Deben since
  2009.
