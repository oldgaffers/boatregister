short_description: <p>&#39;Scala Nimbata&#39; was conceived, designed and built to
  sail and row the River Thames from source to tideway.</p>
full_description: "<p>Selway Fisher Designs produced a design outline against the\
  \ owner/builder&#39;s specification. This included: had to look attractive, have\
  \ good directional stability for rowing, sail well and accommodate four plus ample\
  \ supplies when spectating at the annual Henley Regatta. The hull design was accepted\
  \ and detailed drawings supplied. The proposed sail plan was first approved and\
  \ then produced by Dick Batt Sails. Mast and spar with sail fit within boat.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Building was undertaken as a retirement project and featured in Classic\
  \ Boat Magazine with a sail test on the Thames. Greenwich was reached in three stages.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>A single loose footed sail is carried on a long carbon fibre spar almost\
  \ like a lateen sail, this enables the boat to be rowed with sail set without the\
  \ risk of being injured by a boom. The un-stayed mast, designed to fit Thames bridges,\
  \ also in carbon fibre is extremely light and very strong. Since reefing of the\
  \ sail is not possible a second small sail is carried which can be laced direct\
  \ to the mast for sailing in strong winds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boat has just a halyard,\
  \ a main sheet, a double ended tack line and a line to recover the centre board,\
  \ which includes inset lead ballast, back into the case. When tacking the end of\
  \ the tensioned tack line is released, the spar pulled vertical and released to\
  \ leeward of the mast, at the same time the end of the leeward tack line is tensioned.\
  \ When sailing downwind the tack line can be eased away until almost a square sail\
  \ results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short tacking is practical with the spar remaining to windward\
  \ of the mast. &#39;Scala Nimbat&#39;a has taken part in La Semaine du Golfe Morbihan\
  \ 2003 and 2007, Seafair Milford Haven 2006 and 2008, Fowey Classics 2008.</p>"
