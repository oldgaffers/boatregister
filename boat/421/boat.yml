short_description: 'An oyster smack built 1876 in Maldon. '
full_description: <p>Built in 1876, the Maud was sold in 1928 to a fisherman at Mersea,
  who worked her until he retired in approx. 1960. As tradition goes it is believed
  that because the fisherman retired the boat that he worked retired as well. Her
  original fishing no. was CK78, she later she took the no. MN21.</p><p>In the 1960s,
  she was laid up on the hard at West Mersea for a number of years and allowed to
  deteriorate. However, around 1965 Mr. Cecil Stebbens bought her in a sunken condition
  and brought her to his boatyard at Heybridge Basin. He worked on her for about five
  years to bring her to seaworthy condition, and went on to win a great many races.
  In April 1976 she was bought and converted for cruising and racing purposes.</p><p>In
  1980 Her hull was sheathed in ferrocement by Dan Webb &amp; Feesey, Maldon.</p>In
  2008, she was sold again and taken to the Netherlands.</p>
