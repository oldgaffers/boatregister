full_description: |-
  Built in 1876, the Maud was sold in 1928 to a fisherman at Mersea, who worked
  her until he retired in approx. 1960. As tradition goes it is believed that
  because the fisherman retired the boat that he worked retired as well. Her
  original fishing no. was CK78, she later she took the no. MN21.

  In the 1960s, she was laid up on the hard at West Mersea for a number of years
  and allowed to deteriorate. However, around 1965 Mr. Cecil Stebbens bought her
  in a sunken condition and brought her to his boatyard at Heybridge Basin. He
  worked on her for about five years to bring her to seaworthy condition, and went
  on to win a great many races. In April 1976 she was bought and converted for
  cruising and racing purposes.

  In 1980 Her hull was sheathed in ferrocement by Dan Webb & Feesey, Maldon.

  In 2008, she was sold again and taken to the Netherlands.
