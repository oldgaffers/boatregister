  is easily distinguished by her very low flat hull with its distinctive square counter.  She
  was designed by Dyevre and built by Senocal at Los Mureaux in 1916 as a bermudan
  sloop believed to be to the French 8.5 metric rating, and called Lola.  Built of
  pine on oak frames with all her 14 cwt. ballast on the keel, she came to England
  in 1923 to be sailed with the Island Yacht Club on the Isle of Wight.  By 1925 she
  was based at Orford and had acquired her present name.  She has had many owners
  since, moving down the coast in the process, till she was converted to her present
  gaff cutter rig in 1978 by Derek Lawrence at Maldon.  She has been owned by Kevin
  since that time and he has established a comprehensive history of her and raced
  very successfully against all comers.
