full_description: "<p>Tarifa was kept at Walton on the Naze from when she was built\
  \ for a long time. she was built for H Torif Garnham who sailed her extensively\
  \ on the East Coast with his wife. He wrote 2 articles under the title of &quot;Home\
  \ Waters&quot; in Yachting Monthly May 1912 and June 1911. The rig was converted\
  \ to Bermudan in 1923 and the first engine fitted in 1933.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Hickman\
  \ found her in Cowes blocked up out of the water in a very neglected state. he discovered\
  \ she was up for sale and was such a mess as she had sunk at her mooring in the\
  \ Medina for several months. He was very impressed with her but as he was restoring\
  \ Abaca he didn&#39;t immediately put in an offer. During that summer she deterioated\
  \ and there was a threat to break her up so he decided to put in a low offer which\
  \ was accepted. He then had to get her back to his home at Bembridge. He stopped\
  \ up seams that had opened, checked all the seacocks, refurbished the hand pump\
  \ and put a portable petrol pump on board and she was towed there by the old, Attrill&#39;s\
  \ built, Bembridge harbour ferry. The trip went well she hardly leakd at all. he\
  \ has carried out a careful detailed restoration and he has detailed it all carefully.\
  \ He has researched her history and has the original builder&#39;s plans of the\
  \ hull lines and sail plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999 she underwent extensive restoration\
  \ to her original specification. Her original builder&#39;s plans of hull and sail\
  \ plan were found in early editions of Yachting Monthly. All her pitch pine and\
  \ teak planking is original, as is much of the deck, cabin and cockpit joinery.\
  \ Her rig is a new one but a faithful copy of the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tarifa\
  \ has a shallow draft of 2ft 6ins with a lifting centre plate.</p>"
