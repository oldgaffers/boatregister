full_description: |-
  *Maid Marian* was built in 1908 by William Crossfield & Sons, Beach Walk,
  Arnside for Joe Twyerould, the proprietor of the Star Restaurant in Morecambe, a
  keen amateur yachtsman.Â  Whilst in the ownership of Joe Twyerould, she was
  oftern sailed in Scottish waters. In 1917, whe was registered as a fishing boat,
  LR177, common practice at the end of the First World War.


  In 1921, she was dereigstered as a fishing boat and moved to Windermere where
  she was photographed by Arthur Ransome during the 1929 Windermere Freeze with
  his wife by the bowspirt. The previous summer Arthur brought "Swallow" also
  built by Crossfields. It was on 23rd March 1929, which can not have been long
  after the ice thawed he got the inspiration to write Swallows and Amazon, whilst
  sailing Swallow on the lake. Windermere frooze in February with the ice not
  melting till early March.


  She was sold on the death of Joe Twyerould in 1937 and is reputed to be the
  first yacht to visit Dunkirk after D-Day.


  *Maid Marian* was sailed in the Baltic in the 1960s, which must have been
  exciting given her low freeboard, and featured on a Yachting Monthly Cover in
  1970.


  In 1974 she was kept at Emsworth, Chichester Harbour and sold to a new owner in
  1980 who undertook a total rebuild in his back garden, including fitting a
  bigger mast. She was sold again in 2003 and 2011.
