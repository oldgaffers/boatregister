  \ &amp; Sons, Beach Walk, for Joe Twynould, the proprietor of the Star Restaurant\
  \ in Morecambe, a keen amateur yachtsman. &#39;Maid Marian&#39; is slightly larger\
  \ than one of her sister ships, &#39;Severn&#39;. Whilst in the ownership of Joe\
  \ Twynould, she was oftern sailed in Scottish waters. In 1917, whe was registered\
  \ as a fishing boat, LR177, common practice at the end of the&nbsp;First World War.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1921, she was dereigstered as a fishing boat and moved to Windermere\
  \ where she was&nbsp;photographed by Arthur Ransome during the 1929 Windermere Freeze\
  \ with his wife by the bowspirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sold on the death of Joe\
  \ Twynould, 1937 and is reputed to be the first yacht to visit Dunkirk after D-Day.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>&#39;Maid Marian&#39; was sailed in the Baltic in the 1960s, which must\
  \ have been exciting given her low freeboard, and featured on a Yachting Monthly\
  \ Cover in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1974 she was kept at Emsworth, Chichester Harbour\
  \ and sold to a new owner in 1980 who undertook a total rebuild in his back garden,\
  \ including fitting a bigger mast. She was sold again in 2003 and 2011.</p>"
