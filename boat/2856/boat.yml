full_description: "Externally *Polly Agatha* is an exact replica of *Peggy*, the original\
  \ boat, all of the scantlings are the same as the original and the method of construction\
  \ is also the same with only two exceptions. One is the use of bronze bolts and\
  \ screws instead of the original iron centre line fixings and bronze nails for the\
  \ planking to frame fixings.  \n  \nThe other difference is the deck. The new deck\
  \ is two layers of marine plywood sheathed in epoxy and glass overlaid with 3\"\
  \ wide teak. This option has been selected as an improvement to the original build\
  \ to increase strength, stiffness and durability – a modern deck on a traditional\
  \ hull!  \n  \nIn building this replica they have reintroduced some of the features\
  \ of the original pilot cutter which have since been lost on the 'Peggy'. Hopefully,\
  \ this will further enhance her beautiful lines. This pilot cutter is an interesting\
  \ mix with the traditional lines of a pilot cutter, yet fitted out with a modern\
  \ interior and equipped with all the latest technology. Internally we have selected\
  \ a much more modern and luxurious finish using solid English oak.  \n  \nThe layout\
  \ has a large luxurious master cabin with an en suite head and shower. There is\
  \ a traditional head in the bow and a forward cabin with two berths and two extra\
  \ occasional berths. The saloon has another four berths including two occasional\
  \ on the saloon seats, providing a total of ten berths.  \n  \nThere is a large\
  \ galley and navigational area which includes all the mod cons (and more!!) required\
  \ to licence the boat as a sea school."
