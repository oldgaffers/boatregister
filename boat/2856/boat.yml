full_description: "<p>Externally Polly Agatha is an exact replica of &#39;Peggy&#39;,\
  \ the original boat, all of the scantlings are the same as the original and the\
  \ method of construction is also the same with only two exceptions. One is the use\
  \ of bronze bolts and screws instead of the original iron centre line fixings and\
  \ bronze nails for the planking to frame fixings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other difference\
  \ is the deck. The new deck is two layers of marine plywood sheathed in epoxy and\
  \ glass overlaid with 3&quot; wide teak. This option has been selected as an improvement\
  \ to the original build to increase strength, stiffness and durability &ndash; a\
  \ modern deck on a traditional hull!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In building this replica they\
  \ have reintroduced some of the features of the original pilot cutter which have\
  \ since been lost on the &#39;Peggy&#39;. Hopefully, this will further enhance her\
  \ beautiful lines. This pilot cutter is an interesting mix with the traditional\
  \ lines of a pilot cutter, yet fitted out with a modern interior and equipped with\
  \ all the latest technology. Internally we have selected a much more modern and\
  \ luxurious finish using solid English oak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The layout has a large\
  \ luxurious master cabin with an en suite head and shower. There is a traditional\
  \ head in the bow and a forward cabin with two berths and two extra occasional berths.\
  \ The saloon has another four berths including two occasional on the saloon seats,\
  \ providing a total of ten berths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a large galley and navigational\
  \ area which includes all the mod cons (and more!!) required to licence the boat\
  \ as a sea school.</p>"
