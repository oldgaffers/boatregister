full_description: |-
  Externally *Polly Agatha* is an exact replica of the 1903 Bristol Channel Pilot
  Cutter *Peggy*, which is still sailing.

  All of the scantlings are the same as the original and the method of construction
  of the hull is also the same with only two exceptions. One is the use of bronze bolts and
  screws instead of the original iron centre line fixings and bronze nails for the
  planking to frame fixings.

  Another difference is the deck. *Polly Agatha's* consists of
  two layers of marine plywood sheathed in epoxy and glass overlaid with 3 inch
  wide teak. This was chosen to increase strength, stiffness and durability.

  In building this replica some external features of the original were reintroduced
  which have been lost on the *Peggy*, with the intent of enhancing her beautiful lines.

  The internal layout is optimised for her intended role as a sea school and finished
  in solid English oak. The master cabin is luxurious with an en-suite head and shower.
  There is a traditional head in the bow and a forward cabin with two berths and two extra
  occasional berths. The saloon has another four berths including two occasional
  on the saloon seats, providing a total of ten berths.

  There is a large galley and navigational area fully equipped with modern technology
  including everything needed to licence the boat as a sea school.
