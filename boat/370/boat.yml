  Since 2006, John Krejsa of Woodbridge, Suffolk has been restoring 'Mist' to her
  former glory. She was relaunched on 17 September, 2016.


  With copies of her original drawings, John restored her as near as possible to
  her designer, Albert Strange's intentions. It is a remarkable transformation,
  seeing her change from the boat found 70' deep on the bottom of Gairloch to the
  beautiful canoe stern yawl swinging across into the water on launch day.
