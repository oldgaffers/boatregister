short_description: <p>&#39;Mist&#39; was designed by Albert Strange in 1906 and built
  in 1907 for cruising the western isles of Scotland.</p>
full_description: "<p>Since 2006, John Krejsa of Woodbridge, Suffolk has been restoring\
  \ &#39;Mist&#39; to her former glory. She was relaunched on 17 September, 2016.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>With copies of her original drawings, John restored her as near as possible\
  \ to her designer, Albert Strange&#39;s intentions. It is a remarkable transformation,\
  \ seeing her change from the boat found 70&#39; deep on the bottom of Gairloch to\
  \ the beautiful canoe stern yawl swinging across into the water on launch day.</p>"
