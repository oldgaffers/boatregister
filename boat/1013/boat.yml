  Log 83/4 21 ft. centreboard three-quarter decked sloop. Believed to have been
  built in the 1880s by Inmans yard (now Berthon boatyard) at Lymington. The boat
  has wintered in the same shed, which was built for her (and her sisters) since
  1913 at Christchurch till for sale in '83. Professionally maintained all her
  life. Performance remarkable. In 3 OGA' races she has 2 firsts & a second.
