full_description: "<p>&#39;Nora&#39;, a Morecambe Bay Prawner, was built by the Crossfields\
  \ in 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first owner, Robert (Rodding) Wilson, insured the 31&#39;\
  \ shrimper for &pound;65 in 1926. He also insured his punt for &pound;10 paying\
  \ a premium of 19s. 7d. John &#39;Shiney&#39; Mount insured her for &pound;60 in\
  \ 1935, keeping her with the Mutual until 1943, when she was insured for &pound;265\
  \ at a premium of &pound;13 0s. 5d.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Allan remembered &#39;Shiney&#39;\
  \ Mount heading out to go prawning off Blackpool at 1 to 2 am on a foggy night in\
  \ 1937. The Allan&rsquo;s were in &#39;Alice Allan&#39; LR 170 and &#39;Shiney&#39;\
  \ in &#39;Nora&#39; got in amongst the Fleetwood midwater fleet. &#39;Shiney&#39;\
  \ decided against motoring through the press of bigger boats, and put Nora&rsquo;s\
  \ helm up to go back. Unfortunately &#39;Nora&#39; rammed &#39;Alice Allan&#39;\
  \ broadside, cutting her down to the water and smashing the pump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\
  \ production of courlene netting caused the Morecambe Trawlers Co-operative Society\
  \ Ltd. to close its net loft in 1953. The goodwill was sold to one of the lofts&#39;\
  \ last apprentices, Mr E Nicholson, who holds the records of the lofts. The final\
  \ year trading included a net made for &#39;Nora&#39; LR 59 in 1952, a 17&#39; shrimp\
  \ trawl costing &pound;17 10s 0d.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Nora&#39; was refitted in 1952\
  \ for Frank Brooks, a Morecambe Chemist.</p>"
