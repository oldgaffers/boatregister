full_description: |-
  'Nora', a Morecambe Bay Prawner, was built by the Crossfields in 1912.


  The first owner, Robert (Rodding) Wilson, insured the 31' shrimper for £65 in
  1926. He also insured his punt for £10 paying a premium of 19s. 7d. John
  'Shiney' Mount insured her for £60 in 1935, keeping her with the Mutual until
  1943, when she was insured for £265 at a premium of £13 0s. 5d.


  Harry Allan remembered 'Shiney' Mount heading out to go prawning off Blackpool
  at 1 to 2 am on a foggy night in 1937. The Allan’s were in 'Alice Allan' LR 170
  and 'Shiney' in 'Nora' got in amongst the Fleetwood midwater fleet. 'Shiney'
  decided against motoring through the press of bigger boats, and put Nora’s helm
  up to go back. Unfortunately 'Nora' rammed 'Alice Allan' broadside, cutting her
  down to the water and smashing the pump.


  The production of courlene netting caused the Morecambe Trawlers Co-operative
  Society Ltd. to close its net loft in 1953. The goodwill was sold to one of the
  lofts' last apprentices, Mr E Nicholson, who holds the records of the lofts. The
  final year trading included a net made for 'Nora' LR 59 in 1952, a 17' shrimp
  trawl costing £17 10s 0d.


  'Nora' was refitted in 1952 for Frank Brooks, a Morecambe Chemist.
