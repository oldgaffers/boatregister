full_description: |-
  Sir William Priestley, the Morecambe Fisherman’s Lifeboat was built by
  Crossfields in 1934. Lady Priestley donated the money in memory of her
  husband, a Bradford mill owner, MP and supporter of the RNLI. Sir William had
  been involved in fund raising for the Spurn Head lifeboat “City of Bradford
  II”. Morecambe was popular with holiday makers from   Bradford and was often
  known as “Bradford by the Sea.”


  Six or more replicas have been made of the Sir William Priestley in glass
  fibre using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric Bergqvist, a Cheshire
  Boat Builder in return for royalties of £25 for every boat built.


  Sir William Priestley was retired from service in 1987. She is now in
  Lancaster Maritime Museum awaiting restoration.
