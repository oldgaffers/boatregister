short_description: <p>Tanyss is a 12' sailing dinghy of unknown type</p>
full_description: <p>Tanyss was bought as a restoration project after standing in
  a field for 5 years full of water, and with extensive rot to her mahogany internal
  fittings. She is probably over 20 years old (as of 2020) but real age is unknown.</p><p>Although
  pictures exist of her sailing with a jib on a bowsprit there seems to be no onboard
  fixture points, and since the mast step is well forward she may end up rigged as
  a cat boat.&nbsp; She seems to have two forestays, one each side of the stemhead.
  The only sail she came with is a tan mainsail and&nbsp;some of the rig is missing.</p><p>Probably
  originated&nbsp;as a GRP shell and fitted out by a home builder.</p>
