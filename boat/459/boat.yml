short_description: |-
  Pronounced beyond economic repair around 1990, but a replica hull was built and
  "Patsy" is still sailing today.
full_description: |-
  The original hull was probably built around 1912 by Pearce of Looe and believed
  to be one of the six of her class operating out of Polperro. She was converted
  for pleasure use in Rye in 1946. In 1956 she was bought by John Jefferson and
  kept in Chichester Harbour. She was much cruised by the family between Biscay
  and the Baltic and Ireland including French and Dutch inland waterways.


  Around 1990 she was surveyed and declared beyond repair since the frames were
  seriously rotted. The owner had a replica hull built by Hullmaster of Wootton,
  IOW. The ‘new’ Patsy was launched in 1991, fitted with the original rigging and
  sails and returned to her berth in Birdham Pool. In 2000 she was moved to
  Carentan on the Cherbourg Peninsula where she was based until her return to
  Chichester in 2018.
