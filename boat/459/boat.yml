short_description: <p>Pronounced beyond economic repair around 1990, but a replica
  hull was built and &quot;Patsy&quot; is still sailing today.</p>
full_description: "The original hull was probably built around 1912 by Pearce of Looe\
  \ and believed to be one of the six of her class operating out of Polperro.  She\
  \ was converted for pleasure use in Rye in 1946.  In 1956 she was bought by John\
  \ Jefferson and kept in Chichester Harbour.  She was much cruised by the family\
  \ between Biscay and the Baltic and Ireland including French and Dutch inland waterways.\r\
  \n\r\nAround 1990 she was surveyed and declared beyond repair since the frames were\
  \ seriously rotted.  The owner had a replica hull built by Hullmaster of Wootton,\
  \ IOW.  The \u2018new\u2019 Patsy was launched in 1991, fitted with the original\
  \ rigging and sails and returned to her berth in Birdham Pool.  In 2000 she was\
  \ moved to Carentan on the Cherbourg Peninsula where she was based until her return\
  \ to Chichester in 2018."
