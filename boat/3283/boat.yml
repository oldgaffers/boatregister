short_description: <p>Capella is a 9 ton Hillyard built in Littlehampton. She has
  a canoe sterned carvel built hull constructed of pitch pine on oak frames and backbone.
  Her bright work is a mixture of mahogany and teak.</p>
full_description: "<p>Capella is a good representative of the boats that David Hillyard\
  \ was building at Littlehampton before WWII. The Hillyard yard was at that time\
  \ pioneering mass production of yachts to standard designs. The boats were all carvel\
  \ built, long keeled with mostly canoe sterns and ranged in size from 2.5 to 11\
  \ tons.</p>\n<p>Capella was built in 1937 and cost her owner in the region of \xA3\
  475. Capella first appears in the Lloyds Register 1937, 2nd supplement. It appears\
  \ that Capella was kept by her first owner until 1960 and was berthed somewhere\
  \ in Belfast.</p>\n<p>Since 1960 Capella changed ownership several times and has\
  \ been kept variously on the Solent, at Fleetwod and in Falmouth. She has purportedly\
  \ done a circumnavigation of Britain.</p>\n<p>Much of the original interior has\
  \ alas been removed or altered but she retains something the atmosphere of a 1930s\
  \ cruising yacht.</p>"
