short_description: <p>Master Frank, launched in 1896, continued to fish commercially

full_description: '<p>Master Frank was built between 1893 and 1895 and according to
  a report in the Ramsey Courieur at her launch, 29 January 1896: ''She is very strongly
  built and bids fair to be a good, useful boat.'' She was a &nbsp;half-deck longliner,&nbsp;used
  to fish for cod, named after the fishing method of using a long line.</p><p>She
  was built for Mr Frank Shakley of Whitehaven, but&nbsp;was only at Whitehaven for
  3 months before coming&nbsp;back to Ramsey and the ownership of the Kinnin Family.
  They owned her until 1969.</p><p>After that she has a number of owners before&nbsp;coming
  into the possession of Joe Pennington in 1993. He rebuilt her as originally as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'
