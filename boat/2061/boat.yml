short_description: <p>Master Frank, launched in 1896, continued to fish commercially
  until 1978 and, following an extensive restoration project by her current owner,
  is still seen sailing off the Isle of Man coast.</p>
full_description: '<p>Master Frank was built between 1893 and 1895 and according to
  a report in the Ramsey Courieur at her launch, 29 January 1896: ''She is very strongly
  built and bids fair to be a good, useful boat.'' She was a &nbsp;half-deck longliner,&nbsp;used
  to fish for cod, named after the fishing method of using a long line.</p><p>She
  was built for Mr Frank Shakley of Whitehaven, but&nbsp;was only at Whitehaven for
  3 months before coming&nbsp;back to Ramsey and the ownership of the Kinnin Family.
  They owned her until 1969.</p><p>After that she has a number of owners before&nbsp;coming
  into the possession of Joe Pennington in 1993. He rebuilt her as originally as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'
