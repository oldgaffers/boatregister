short_description: |-
  Master Frank, launched in 1896, continued to fish commercially
  until 1978 and, following an extensive restoration project by her current owner,
  is still seen sailing off the Isle of Man coast.
full_description: |-
  Master Frank was built between 1893 and 1895 and according to
  a report in the Ramsey Courieur at her launch, 29 January 1896: "She is very strongly
  built and bids fair to be a good, useful boat.""
  She was a half-deck longliner, used to fish for cod, named after the fishing method of using a long line.

  She was built for Mr Frank Shakley of Whitehaven, but was only at Whitehaven for
  3 months before coming back to Ramsey and the ownership of the Kinnin Family.
  They owned her until 1969.

  After that she has a number of owners before coming into the possession of Joe Pennington in 1993.
  He rebuilt her to as close to her original condition as possible.

    Master Frank is the Isle of Man's oldest boat afloat and the
    only surviving half decked longliner. She was originally built in 1896 by Clucas
    &amp; Duggan shipwrights of Ramsey. She has an innovative build, with elements
    from Essex Smacks, and Morecambe Bay Prawners but also has a &ldquo;rocker&rdquo;
    keel. Rigged as a gaff cutter.

    Lovingly rebuilt in 1993-96 by her current owner, a master carpenter and shipwright,
    the <em>Master Frank</em> has been kept in good condition. She has had a new big jib in 2021,
    new mainsail in 2019, and the engine has only done about 300hrs since the last rebuild.
    
    Fully equipped, ready to sail, and used regularly. Lying Ramsey, Isle of Man
