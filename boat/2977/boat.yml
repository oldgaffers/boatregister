short_description: |-
  Quemoy is believed to have been built on the Isle of Wight around 1910 and sent
  by rail to the Medway in the 20s with the Sea View Mermaid fleet. Her survival
  is undoubtedly due to sturdy construction (a double skin of pitch pine on oak
  frames) and owners who fell in love with her sweet lines.

  Quemoy was found abandoned on a mud-berth in the Medway in the 1960s. At this
  stage she had a small cabin and and an old Stuart Turner. She was extensively
  restored with a new cabin and a ketch rig by a Royal Engineer. She remained in
  Kent until she was found in a sorry state in the 1990s. Restoration was started
  but was discontinued.


  In 2000 she was bought by the present owner who returned her to the Isle of
  Wight. Between 2000 and 2010 she was substantially re-built as a day boat by
  Eddie Wade of Bembridge with a new keel and deck. Although the planking was in
  reasonable condition it was decided to spline her and add a double-skin of
  mahogany veneer. All oak frames and floors were replaced. Quemoy was fitted out
  by Bill Mitchell at AA Coombes. Sails were cut by Paul Newell with a new gaff
  rig being made in Yarmouth.
