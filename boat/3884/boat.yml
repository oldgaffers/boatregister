short_description: "Wayward, a \u2018gentleman\u2019s yawl\u2019, was launched in\
  \ 1898, having been commissioned by HT Shaw of Beaulieu."
full_description: "She was built at the Northam yard of Summers & Payne, from the\
  \ drawing board of A.E.Payne His father and then his elder brother had owned the\
  \ yard at Northam, Southampton before him so one Payne or another had designed and\
  \ built fast race winners and cruising yachts for most of the nineteenth century.\
  \  The yard became Summers & Payne in 1890 before being taken over lock stock and\
  \ workforce by Camper and Nicholson in the early 1900s.  Mr Shaw was a member of\
  \ the Royal Yacht Squadron and after two years of racing (with unknown results)\
  \ he sold her to Avery Jones of Bristol, the son of the mayor.  By 1902 she had\
  \ been converted to cutter fig and renamed Samphire.  Fully restored and converted\
  \ for charter in 1991 at the Bristol yard of Storms\u2019l Services\u2019 and fitted\
  \ with Noble Marine spars, by 2010 she was sitti ng idle on the South Coast.  After\
  \ another refit at the Bristol Classic Boat Company she was returned to a yawl rig\
  \ and re-converted below to echo her elegance of form and her pedigree as a Victorian\
  \ gentleman\u2019s racing yacht.  She was relaunched in 2017 and given her original\
  \ name of Wayward.  In 2019 she was for sale."
