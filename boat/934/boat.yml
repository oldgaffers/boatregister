full_description: "*Little Millie* is a Memory class, born in the early\n1970s from
  the hand of designer Tony Robinson. The inspiration behind the design\ndates back
  from way before. The practicality of the open layout together with the\nshoal draft
  and centreplate has the traits of a Brightlingsea fishing smack, equally\nat home
  taking the ground at low tide or slipped onto a trailer. Since then over\n150 Memories
  have been built and are now a well proven classic in their own right;\nsafe, easily
  handled yet fast boats with numerous wins to their credit in OGA events.\n\nThe
  Memory has been fitted out in many different ways over the years but remain true\n
  to the original concept of simplicity and function. Built by Salterns Yachts their\n
  philosophy has been to use the very best of modern and traditional materials and\n
  craftsmanship, to give an uncomplicated yet beautiful boat of which any owner can\n
  be truly proud. The gaff rig is very practical and easy to use, the large sail area\n
  can be simply set, controlled and reefed from the large cockpit.\n\nDesigned originally
  as an open boat the accommodation is modest but practical, with two\nfull sized
  berths and some storage in a vee formation in the snug little cabin under\nthe foredeck.\n
  \nThe Memory has internal ballast, as her wooden ancestors. This\nis lead ingots
  contained within compartments on either side of the centreplate case.\nThis is of
  course removable, making the Memory very light for manoeuvring on shore\nand at
  about one ton fully ballasted, including trailer, means she can easily be\ntowed
  behind a substantial car or 4x4. The 50 kg centreplate is designed to fit under\n
  the cockpit sole, and is easily raised on it's own block and tackle.\n"

  sales_text: Little Millie is a Memory class gaff sloop built around 1979 from the
    hand of designer Tony Robinson. The inspiration behind the design dates back from
    way before with the fibreglass hull mould being taken from a 1922 Brightlingsea
    fishing smack called ‘Brownie’. The heavy fibreglass mould retains the marks of
    the planking from the original boat so that only on close examination it becomes
    apparent she is not an original wooden craft. The seats, cockpit floor, cabin
    doors, tiller,  rubbing strake and trim are mahogany.  The practicality of the
    open layout together with the shoal draft and centreplate makes Little Millie
    equally at home taking the ground at low tide or slipped onto a trailer. Over
    150 Memories have been built and are now a well proven classic in their own right;
    safe, easily handled yet fast boats with numerous wins to their credit in Old
    Gaffers Association events. Little Millie is registered with the OGA (No 934)
    and has competed in the Falmouth Classics in recent years.  Designed originally
    as an ‘open’ boat the accommodation is modest but practical, with two full sized
    berths (new cushions in 2018) and some storage in a vee formation in the snug
    little cabin under the foredeck accessed by twin cabin doors and lifting hatch.
    The large cockpit has room to comfortably sail with up to 6 adults. A boat tent
    (new 2018) extends the accommodation allowing fun family camping adventures aboard.  The
    impressive gaff rig is very practical and easy to use, the large sail area can
    be simply set, controlled and reefed from the large cockpit. Little Millie can
    be rigged as a gaff sloop or cutter with two headsails from her bowsprit. The
    wardrobe of tan sails include gaff mainsail with two slab reefing options, 2 x
    Genoa’s with bronze Wykeham Martin furling system, inner jib and storm jib  The
    Memory has internal ballast, as did her wooden ancestors. This is lead ingots
    contained within compartments on either side of the centreplate case, making the
    Memory about one ton fully ballasted meaning she can easily be towed behind a
    moderate car or 4X4. Little Millie has a Mersey galvanised Road trailer (bought
    2017 cost £2,640) with less than 500 miles since new. The trailer has never been
    submerged as under my ownership the boat was always lifted into water.  The 50Kg
    galvanised centreplate pivots under the cockpit sole, and is easily raised on
    it's own block and tackle - a new lifting cable was fitted in 2019. Little Millie
    draws only 18 inches with the plate lifted and 39 inches with it down.  The 20
    foot solid pine mast is easily stepped in a steel deck mounted tabernacle with
    stainless steel standing rigging to bronze chain plates. The main sheet runs on
    a traditional traveller through a modern block with cam. Vintage Tufnol winches
    are fitted port and starboard for Genoa sheets.   Yamaha 4hp two stroke long shaft
    outboard mounted on lifting engine bracket (serviced 2020). Fuel tank with hose
    and squeeze pump.   Other equipment includes flush deck compass, 15kg CQR anchor
    with 5m galvanised chain and 20m warp. Cockpit mooring cover and mast scissor
    support. Whale Gusher bilge pump. Safety rescue throwing line, and emergency boarding
    ladder.   Little Millie has been sailed enthusiastically and comes with the knocks
    and scrapes that you expect from a 40 year old boat. She is not concours, but
    is in good condition overall, with lots of character and ready to sail.  Little
    Millie is currently on a mooring on the Helford River which may be transferable
    to the new owner.
