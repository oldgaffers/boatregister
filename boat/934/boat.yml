short_description: '&lsquo;Little Millie&rsquo; is a gaff-rigged GRP Memory 19 built
  in 1979. She is the open cockpit version, with lifting hatch access to a cuddy below
  the foredeck. She&rsquo;s great to sail single-handed with room in the cockpit for
  the whole family.'
full_description: '&lsquo;Little Millie&rsquo; is a Memory class, born in the early
  1970s from the hand of designer Tony Robinson. The inspiration behind the design
  dates back from way before. The practicality of the open layout together with the
  shoal draft and centreplate has the traits of a Brightlingsea fishing smack, equally
  at home taking the ground at low tide or slipped onto a trailer. Since then over
  150 Memories have been built and are now a well proven classic in their own right;
  safe, easily handled yet fast boats with numerous wins to their credit in OGA events.</p><p>The
  Memory has been fitted out in many different ways over the years but remain true
  to the original concept of simplicity and function. Built by Salterns Yachts their
  philosophy has been to use the very best of modern and traditional materials and
  craftsmanship, to give an uncomplicated yet beautiful boat of which any owner can
  be truly proud. The gaff rig is very practical and easy to use, the large sail area
  can be simply set, controlled and reefed from the large cockpit.<p>Designed originally
  as an &lsquo;open&rsquo; boat the accommodation is modest but practical, with two
  full sized berths and some storage in a vee formation in the snug little cabin under
  the foredeck.</p><p>The Memory has internal ballast, as her wooden ancestors. This
  is lead ingots contained within compartments on either side of the centreplate case.
  This is of course removable, making the Memory very light for manoeuvring on shore
  and at about one ton fully ballasted, including trailer, means she can easily be
  towed behind a substantial car or 4X4. The 50Kg centreplate is designed to fit under
  the cockpit sole, and is easily raised on it''s own block and tackle.'
