  '*Little Millie* is a Memory class, born in the early
  1970s from the hand of designer Tony Robinson. The inspiration behind the design
  dates back from way before. The practicality of the open layout together with the
  shoal draft and centreplate has the traits of a Brightlingsea fishing smack, equally
  at home taking the ground at low tide or slipped onto a trailer. Since then over
  150 Memories have been built and are now a well proven classic in their own right;
  safe, easily handled yet fast boats with numerous wins to their credit in OGA events.
  
  The Memory has been fitted out in many different ways over the years but remain true
  to the original concept of simplicity and function. Built by Salterns Yachts their
  philosophy has been to use the very best of modern and traditional materials and
  craftsmanship, to give an uncomplicated yet beautiful boat of which any owner can
  be truly proud. The gaff rig is very practical and easy to use, the large sail area
  can be simply set, controlled and reefed from the large cockpit.
  
  Designed originally as an open boat the accommodation is modest but practical, with two
  full sized berths and some storage in a vee formation in the snug little cabin under
  the foredeck.
  
  The Memory has internal ballast, as her wooden ancestors. This
  is lead ingots contained within compartments on either side of the centreplate case.
  This is of course removable, making the Memory very light for manoeuvring on shore
  and at about one ton fully ballasted, including trailer, means she can easily be
  towed behind a substantial car or 4x4. The 50 kg centreplate is designed to fit under
  the cockpit sole, and is easily raised on it's own block and tackle.

  sales_text: "Little Millie is a Memory class gaff sloop built around 1979 from the\
    \ hand of designer Tony Robinson. The inspiration behind the design dates back\
    \ from way before with the fibreglass hull mould being taken from a 1922 Brightlingsea\
    \ fishing smack called \u2018Brownie\u2019. The heavy fibreglass mould retains\
    \ the marks of the planking from the original boat so that only on close examination\
    \ it becomes apparent she is not an original wooden craft. The seats, cockpit\
    \ floor, cabin doors, tiller,  rubbing strake and trim are mahogany.  The practicality\
    \ of the open layout together with the shoal draft and centreplate makes Little\
    \ Millie equally at home taking the ground at low tide or slipped onto a trailer.\
    \ Over 150 Memories have been built and are now a well proven classic in their\
    \ own right; safe, easily handled yet fast boats with numerous wins to their credit\
    \ in Old Gaffers Association events. Little Millie is registered with the OGA\
    \ (No 934) and has competed in the Falmouth Classics in recent years.  Designed\
    \ originally as an \u2018open\u2019 boat the accommodation is modest but practical,\
    \ with two full sized berths (new cushions in 2018) and some storage in a vee\
    \ formation in the snug little cabin under the foredeck accessed by twin cabin\
    \ doors and lifting hatch. The large cockpit has room to comfortably sail with\
    \ up to 6 adults. A boat tent (new 2018) extends the accommodation allowing fun\
    \ family camping adventures aboard.  The impressive gaff rig is very practical\
    \ and easy to use, the large sail area can be simply set, controlled and reefed\
    \ from the large cockpit. Little Millie can be rigged as a gaff sloop or cutter\
    \ with two headsails from her bowsprit. The wardrobe of tan sails include gaff\
    \ mainsail with two slab reefing options, 2 x Genoa\u2019s with bronze Wykeham\
    \ Martin furling system, inner jib and storm jib  The Memory has internal ballast,\
    \ as did her wooden ancestors. This is lead ingots contained within compartments\
    \ on either side of the centreplate case, making the Memory about one ton fully\
    \ ballasted meaning she can easily be towed behind a moderate car or 4X4. Little\
    \ Millie has a Mersey galvanised Road trailer (bought 2017 cost \xA32,640) with\
    \ less than 500 miles since new. The trailer has never been submerged as under\
    \ my ownership the boat was always lifted into water.  The 50Kg galvanised centreplate\
    \ pivots under the cockpit sole, and is easily raised on it's own block and tackle\
    \ - a new lifting cable was fitted in 2019. Little Millie draws only 18 inches\
    \ with the plate lifted and 39 inches with it down.  The 20 foot solid pine mast\
    \ is easily stepped in a steel deck mounted tabernacle with stainless steel standing\
    \ rigging to bronze chain plates. The main sheet runs on a traditional traveller\
    \ through a modern block with cam. Vintage Tufnol winches are fitted port and\
    \ starboard for Genoa sheets.   Yamaha 4hp two stroke long shaft outboard mounted\
    \ on lifting engine bracket (serviced 2020). Fuel tank with hose and squeeze pump.\
    \   Other equipment includes flush deck compass, 15kg CQR anchor with 5m galvanised\
    \ chain and 20m warp. Cockpit mooring cover and mast scissor support. Whale Gusher\
    \ bilge pump. Safety rescue throwing line, and emergency boarding ladder.   Little\
    \ Millie has been sailed enthusiastically and comes with the knocks and scrapes\
    \ that you expect from a 40 year old boat. She is not concours, but is in good\
    \ condition overall, with lots of character and ready to sail.  Little Millie\
    \ is currently on a mooring on the Helford River which may be transferable to\
    \ the new owner."
