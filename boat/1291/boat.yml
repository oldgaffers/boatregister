full_description: "<p>Ferro-cement hull built by Windboats of Wroxham to John Perryman&#39;s
  Norske 35 design based on Colin Archer lifeboats. Understood to have been home completed
  over a long period of time during which it is believed she changed hands, launching
  as &#39;Sujo&#39; about 1987 on the East Coast of England where she was used for
  sail training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In about 2000 she changed hands and moved to the English
  South Coast and cruised to France, Spain and Portugal. Changing hands again in 2005
  she was re-named &#39;Grace&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a refit in 2008 she cruised
  to South Brittany and was kept there for four seasons, returning to UK waters in
  2013, being berthed in Exmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has returned to her French home
  port of La Roche Bernard.</p>"
