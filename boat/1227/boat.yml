  Hull believed to be a Canadian design with 3 keels and a Bermudan
  rig. The Builder of the hull is unknown. Frank Graves fitted out the cabin and gave
  her a gaff rig and engine in early 1970's at Paglesham. Twin keels were removed
  in 1979, a topmast added and bowsprit lengthened.
  
  13/3/2015 - In need of a re-build.
  
  Due to illness the owner was not able to rebuild, and local pressure from the Panglesham
  Village Trust led to her breakup in 2019. The mast is to be re-used as the mizzen
  mast for the lugger *Lyonesse of Mousehole*.
