full_description: "<p>She was purchased as a fishing boat in 1935 and converted by\
  \ Corbetts at Greenwich to have four berths in two cabins. When purchased she had\
  \ a loose footed mainsail and &#39;Handy Billy&#39; auxiliary. She lay in Leigh\
  \ Creek from 1939 to 1946 and was then salvaged and rebuilt by S. Emms and G. Doris,\
  \ when an old Coventry Climax petrol engine was fitted. An extensive refit was carried\
  \ out at Kings of Burnham between 1962 and 1964, and she sailed with a traditional\
  \ mainsail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coventry engine was replaced by a Dorman 4DSM diesel\
  \ with, new stern gear in 1960. Her hull was ferro-cement clad, with deck covered\
  \ with marine ply and glassed with epoxy. New rail stanchions and rail were added\
  \ with some rearrangement of accommodation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The owner hoped to fit\
  \ new engine to replace the Dorman 4DSM now 50 years old and have her in commission\
  \ by 1998.</p>"
