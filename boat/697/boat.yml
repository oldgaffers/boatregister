short_description: <p>Lufra is a&nbsp;much travelled Deben Cherub, having been sailed
  in Scotland and Cornwall, as well as the Scilly Isles</p>
full_description: "From Gaffer's Log 74-4\r\n\"We fully intended taking part in the\
  \ 1977 Clyde Race, and were at Rhu Marina the previous night, but the rising forecast\
  \ and conditions outside the Gairloch did not sound suitable for a Cherub full of\
  \ Cruising Gear. So we watched from the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Lufra's main has been cut\
  \ down slightly and a longer bowsprit fitted to give her a cutter rig, reducing\
  \ the heavy weather helm of the original. Also a topsail is carried in winds of\
  \ force 3-4 or less and acts as the first reef. After the Clyde race we had to leave\
  \ the boat at Inverkip for a week, a friend and I sailed her home to Girvan the\
  \ following Sunday with a quartering breeze and all plain sail plus topsail and\
  \ drabbler. We left Kip Marian at 17:30 and entered Girvan Pierheads at 15:30. Not\
  \ bad for a Cherub.\"\r\n\r\nLufra moved south after this race, and was subsequently\
  \ kept in Cornwall and the Isles of  Scilly. In 1987 her rig was recorded as being\
  \ altered from a \"high peak gaff sloop to a conventional gaff cutter, with the\
  \ mast altered to fit in a tabernacle.\""
