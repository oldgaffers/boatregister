full_description: |-
  From Gaffer's Log 74-4 "We fully intended taking part in the 1977 Clyde Race,
  and were at Rhu Marina the previous night, but the rising forecast and
  conditions outside the Gairloch did not sound suitable for a Cherub full of
  Cruising Gear. So we watched from the shore.

  "Lufra's main has been cut down slightly and a longer bowsprit fitted to give
  her a cutter rig, reducing the heavy weather helm of the original. Also a
  topsail is carried in winds of force 3-4 or less and acts as the first reef.
  After the Clyde race we had to leave the boat at Inverkip for a week, a friend
  and I sailed her home to Girvan the following Sunday with a quartering breeze
  and all plain sail plus topsail and drabbler. We left Kip Marian at 17:30 and
  entered Girvan Pierheads at 15:30. Not bad for a Cherub."

  Lufra moved south after this race, and was subsequently kept in Cornwall and the
  Isles of Scilly. In 1987 her rig was recorded as being altered from a "high peak
  gaff sloop to a conventional gaff cutter, with the mast altered to fit in a
  tabernacle."

  After a period ashore, work began to get her back in commission during the Covid
  lockdown, and she was back afloat in 2023.
