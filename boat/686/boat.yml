full_description: "<h3>Brian Cox describes his restoration project<br />\r\nfirst\
  \ published in Gaffers Log, June 2008</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Acquired by Cyril\
  \ Cozens in the 1950s, &#39;Reprieve&#39; was rigged as a yawl, and thereafter restored\
  \ together with his father to her original cutter rig. In the period to the late\
  \ 1970s early 1980s, she was used for pleasure and as a work-horse, positioning\
  \ mooring buoys in support of his role as Bosun of Marchwood Sailing Club before\
  \ the latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s saw a turndown in fortunes leaving\
  \ &lsquo;Reprieve&rsquo; permanently laid up at Quayside Marina in Southampton.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Looking for a retirement project in 1994, I heard that Cyril was\
  \ perhaps looking to sell /Reprieve/, which required fairly extensive renovation.\
  \ Being an innocent in the shipwrights world, but wise enough to be sure that the\
  \ hull was in good shape, an agreement was finally struck with a still somewhat\
  \ reluctant Cyril on a very wet November day in 1994, with rain pouring in through\
  \ the skylights and us standing up to our ankles in water in the main cabin. Put\
  \ simply, I acquired the ownership/stewardship of &lsquo;Reprieve&rsquo;, together\
  \ with Cyril&rsquo;s skills which would be so essential to the success of the renovation\
  \ project. I then left for a six month break in New Zealand, naively convinced that\
  \ sailing would be on the cards before the end of 1995. Well we all have our dreams.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>26 May 1995 saw the start of the project, with &lsquo;Reprieve&rsquo;\
  \ moved to, and lifted out at Kemps Quay. Once ashore she was found to have surprisingly\
  \ little marine growth on her bottom considering it was the first lift out for 17\
  \ years, perhaps in part due to one of the many of Cyril&rsquo;s &lsquo;concoctions&rsquo;\
  \ with which it became progressively evident had so well preserved her.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Only one small patch of fresh water rot being found in the hull\
  \ side planking, and this caused by a rain water run off from the covering board.\
  \ The external planking would need re- caulking; the decks would require replacement\
  \ as would the mast, spars and rigging. Internally she would require to be &ldquo;gutted&rdquo;\
  \ with a replacement required for the old Kelvin Petrol Paraffin &ldquo;Puffer&rdquo;\
  \ Engine installed by Cyril many years earlier. The six month renovation was starting\
  \ to look a little ambitious!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The very hot dry summer\
  \ of 1995 necessitated a minimum period ashore and saw rapid progress in the completion\
  \ of the below waterline repairs including replacement of the rudder fittings, caulking\
  \ and bitumen coating of the bottom. As a cost saving, antifouling and the fitting\
  \ of anodes were omitted on the recommendations of the manufacturers, due to location\
  \ on a mud berth and the lack of onboard electrics. The end of July saw her back\
  \ at her mooring in Quayside Marina with a clear delineation of work pattern emerging,\
  \ Cyril handling technical repairs and deck replacement, with his inexperienced\
  \ assistant or &ldquo;boy&rdquo; as he usually called me, carrying out the internal\
  \ rebuilding, the &ldquo;fripperies&rdquo; which really didn&rsquo;t interest him\
  \ greatly. As those who know and sailed with him will recall, for Cyril the sailing\
  \ was what counted and he would sail her hard, often with a petrol driven pump stemming\
  \ the water inflow through un-caulked planking which his 24/7 working life often\
  \ did not allow the time to address.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The period\
  \ through to the end of March 1996 saw a total clearout on deck and of the interior,\
  \ commencement of burning off of the old interior hull paint, a start to re-planking\
  \ the foredeck, dropping the mast, which after removal of all rigging formed a ridge\
  \ pole for the &ldquo;over cover&rdquo; creating what was somewhat unkindly referred\
  \ to as &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo;, and other comments such as, &ldquo;where\
  \ are the widow boxes&rdquo; . On the upside, it created a great spacious warm and\
  \ dry full height work area in the cockpit, which served us well over the next nine\
  \ years.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>April 1996 through March 1997 saw little\
  \ input from me due to an unexpected consultancy assignment in the USA. Notwithstanding,\
  \ Cyril made considerable progress, completing the burn-off and repainting of the\
  \ internal hull planking, overhauling a replacement engine, installing a new driveline\
  \ of his own design incorporating the old Kelvin couplings and a Range Rover drive\
  \ shaft leading up to successful engine trials in June 1997.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\
  <blockquote>By now it had become evident the huge footage and cost of timber required\
  \ for decking and fitting out the interior. With new timber other than for special\
  \ trim being out of the question, we directed our attention to the local demolition\
  \ companies. We were lucky as C J Rogers had recently removed a wooden factory floor,\
  \ which in quality, quantity and price met &ldquo;Reprieve&rsquo;s&rdquo; total\
  \ needs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>With timber supplies resolved, progress\
  \ continued apace in the period April 1997 through September 1999. Forward and Main\
  \ Cabin floors were laid, bulkheads, cupboards and furniture assembled and fitted,\
  \ bunks made for forward and main cabins, new companionway built and fitted, galley\
  \ and chartroom constructed and deck heads and side trims fitted throughout.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Sadly, on 9 September 1999, whilst being moved to another berth\
  \ within the marina, and misjudging both the rate of the falling water level and\
  \ the position of the bank on the approach to the new berth she ran aground. Once\
  \ grounded, re-floating was not a consideration until the next tide. Unfortunately,\
  \ only being caulked to 6&rdquo; above the waterline she did not re-float despite\
  \ the magnificent efforts of the Fire Brigade who turned out 3 engines and many\
  \ portable pumps, Mr Diesel who brought pumps and many others. It was two days before\
  \ she could be righted and re-floated. After the initial shock, where Cyril and\
  \ I saw five years work covered in silt, necessitating major cleaning and stripping\
  \ of much of our new internal structure, also the badly damaged reconditioned engine,\
  \ we could well have thrown in the towel.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The New\
  \ Millennium saw the &ldquo;Phoenix raised from the ashes&rdquo;, with work recommencing\
  \ in May 2000 following a winter of cleaning and drying out. Some twelve months\
  \ was taken up in recovering the position pre the sinking with 2002 seeing significant\
  \ progress once again, with completion of the internal woodwork, painting and varnishing\
  \ and fittings in the Heads, Galley, Chartroom and Forward and Main Cabins. On deck,\
  \ Cyril was progressing with laying his decks and I made a start on the topsides\
  \ by building the new Forward Hatch, overhauling the Main Skylights and fitting\
  \ New Galley Skylight and a new Companionway Hatch, also starting the reconstruction\
  \ of the cockpit, lockers and hatches, after initially raising the floor by 6 inches.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Cyril&rsquo;s health sadly did not enable him to contribute as\
  \ in the past, his interest remained high and he continued workshop based support.\
  \ Contractor technical support now became a factor and cost within the project through\
  \ to completion. Significant progress was achieved in 2003, including the installation\
  \ of the pressurised hot and cold water system, new Yanmar 3GM30F engine and the\
  \ associated electrics, drive shaft, exhaust system and fuel tank, cockpit drains,\
  \ also the starboard side deck was laid and the steering gear (an old truck steering\
  \ shaft and box designed and fitted by Cyril many years earlier) overhauled and\
  \ refitted. Upholstery was fitted throughout and living aboard at last became possible\
  \ with goodbye finally being said to &ldquo;Mischief&rdquo; my &ldquo;plastic&rdquo;\
  \ boat owned from new in 1979 and latterly used as my summer caravan.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>June 2004 saw further upheaval following the need by the marina\
  \ to remove the section of pontoons which had been Reprieve&rsquo;s berth since\
  \ the sinking. Kemps Marina stepped into the breach allocating Reprieve the only\
  \ berth that had been dredged to accept a deep keel at low water. Complaints followed\
  \ from a number of berth holders unhappy to associate their &ldquo;pride and joy\
  \ plastic boats&rdquo; with &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark, forgetting of course the story\
  \ of the Ugly Duckling. Despite the disruption, work proceeded apace, the one rotten\
  \ hull plank replaced, the cockpit completed with engine controls, instrumentation\
  \ and floor decked out and construction of the bulwarks commenced. Canvas skylight,\
  \ cockpit and hatch covers were made up ready for the day when after ten years the\
  \ &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; top would be removed in the spring of 2005.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>The tenth anniversary of the commencement of the &ldquo;six month\
  \ project&rdquo; was the start of a momentous year. Initially, with the &ldquo;ugly\
  \ duckling&rdquo; transformed into the &ldquo;swan&rdquo;, with the removal of the\
  \ covers, followed by not only on-going interest from those who had complained but\
  \ even apologies were offered for previous attitudes.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>With\
  \ the removal of the covers work progressed with fitting the bulwarks until the\
  \ exciting day of 8th August 2005, when &ldquo;Reprieve&rdquo; made her way down\
  \ the River Itchen under her own power to American Wharf for lift out and below\
  \ the water line clean and any necessary repairs, also complete burn off, caulking\
  \ and painting of waterline to deck prior to the Over- side Survey&rdquo;. In parallel\
  \ the port side deck laid by Cyril was to be replaced to bring it to the same standard\
  \ as that professionally laid on the starboard side. Eight exhausting weeks later\
  \ with all targets met thanks to the many helpers, she was back at her berth looking\
  \ a picture and justifying the cracking of a bottle of Bubbly.</blockquote>\r\n\r\
  \n<blockquote>Topsides was the centre of activity for 2006, starting with repairs\
  \ to and re-covering the coach roof, the fitting of the capping rail to the bulwarks\
  \ and repainting all topsides woodwork. Doesn&rsquo;t sound much, but it filled\
  \ all the available working time that summer. With the exterior now complete the\
  \ time had at last come to consider the new mast, spars and rigging. A meeting was\
  \ held on the 3rd November 2006 in the car park of Kemps Marina with Peter Martin\
  \ of Martins Rigging Ltd and Matt Sutherland of Sutherlands Traditional Shipwrights\
  \ who was to build the mast and spars, where all &ldquo;Reprieve&rsquo;s&rdquo;\
  \ sails new and old were laid out. The old flax sails were sadly beyond repair,\
  \ but incredibly there was also a complete set of new sails, which had never even\
  \ been out of the sail bags since they were made around 1978. A rig design was finalised,\
  \ the shock of the cost absorbed and a deal struck, with a completion target of\
  \ spring 2007.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The target was not achieved and it\
  \ was not until the 11th September 2007, on a glorious sunny day that the mast was\
  \ finally stepped in its tabernacle aboard &ldquo;Reprieve&rdquo; atop a new 2007\
  \ penny. The delay in the mast and spars build was worth it, having provided the\
  \ opportunity to be involved at all stages from timber selection through to the\
  \ application of the 22nd and final coat of varnish. Completion of the rig, minor\
  \ adjustments, final survey and getting a weather window to test sails etc., delayed\
  \ the &ldquo;big day&rdquo;, the Sea Trials until the 24th October 2007. However,\
  \ on the day she performed perfectly, despite rather than because of the too many\
  \ Cooks, sorry Captains. The only cook on board being my other half Lilian, who\
  \ kept all well supplied with bacon and sausage rolls and coffee Photo 28). &ldquo;Reprieve&rdquo;\
  \ sailed beautifully without a single leak found.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The\
  \ weather and other commitments scuppered further sailing; however, I am hopeful\
  \ that 2008 will offer both the weather and the opportunity to participate with\
  \ other members at functions of the Old Gaffers Association, so that the fruits\
  \ of this &ldquo;six month&rdquo; retirement project can be enjoyed to the full.</blockquote>"
