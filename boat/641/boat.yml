short_description: <p>&#39;Fleetwing&#39; was the 2nd Harrison Butler Cruising yacht
  built, and the oldest now surviving. Although originally called &#39;Seagull&#39;,
  she had been renamed &#39;Fleetwing&#39; only a year later, in&nbsp;1914.</p>
full_description: "Built in 1913, 'Fleetwing' is one of the oldest surviving Harrison\
  \ Butler designed yachts. 'Memory' was built the year before, and 'Argo' the year\
  \ after. \r\n\r\nShe sailed on the Norfolk broads, then from 1934 sailed out of\
  \ Dover making frequent Channel crossings before  WWII.\r\n\r\nIn 1976 she moved\
  \ to Maylandsea on the river Blackwater, competing in the OGA's East Coast Race\
  \ in 1979 and 1980. In 1980  she won the Boat World Trophy, for coming first in\
  \ Class II.\r\n\r\nAlthough of historical value she's had some difficult years recently,\
  \ with a succession of owners taking her on, only to find she was \u201Cmore of\
  \ a project\u201D than they initially realised. Paul Goold installed 'Fleetwing'\
  \ under a tent in the Heritage Marine boatyard in Essex where work on her is progressing\
  \ steadily; the floors have being re galvanised and are back in. A professional\
  \ boat surveyor looked at her hull in November 2015 and came up with a schedule\
  \ of work."
