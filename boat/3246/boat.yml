full_description: |+
  *Odd Times III* is a Tamarisk 24, a design evolved from
  a lengthened Tamarisk 22. In turn, this was the gaff rigged version of the Bermudan
  Itchen Ferry, the mould for which was the Itchen Ferry *Nellie*,
  built in Southampton, an 1865 Daniel G Hatcher boat.
  
  The name *Odd Times* comes from the West Mersea area where one vessel or another has fished
  under that name since the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.
  
  The early Tamarisk 22s and 24s were built by North Sea Craft in Norfolk until the moulds
  were sold to North Cornwall Marine where later boats were built. It is thought
  that some 34 boats were built, with *Odd Times III* being the sixth. Her
  OGA registration no. is 3246, 3 for *Odd Times*, 24 for the Tamarisk and
  6 for the sixth built!
  
  In 1958 a 23.5' gaff cutter designed by John Leather was given the name *Odd Times*.
  This boat was bought by Peter Rose in 1961 who, after crossing the Atlantic, 
  eventually commissioned *Odd Times II* in 1968, a 37' gaff cutter, also by John Leather, 
  for further Atlantic crossings. *Odd Times III* was commissioned by Rev. Peter Rose
  in 1974 from North Sea Craft of Norfolk. Launched in 1975 she was initially based
  in Yarmouth, cruising the Channel, north French coast and Scilly Isles before
  moving to the Helford River and later Falmouth.
  
  After several more owners *Odd Times III* returned to cruising the Solent and 
  racing/rallying with the OGA.
