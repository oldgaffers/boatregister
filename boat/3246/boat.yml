short_description: <p>&#39;Odd Times&#39; comes from West Mersea where there has been
  a fishing boat of that name since the early 19th century. In 2019, she&#39;s moored
  on the Hamble River, in Hampshire.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Odd Times III&#39; is a Tamarisk 24, a design evolved from\
  \ a lengthened Tamarisk 22. In turn, this was the gaff rigged version of the Bermudan\
  \ &#39;Itchen Ferry&#39;, the mould for which was the Itchen Ferry &#39;Nellie&#39;,\
  \ built in Southampton, an 1865 Daniel G Hatcher boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name &#39;Odd\
  \ Times&#39; comes from the West Mersea area where one vessel or another has fished\
  \ under that name since the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early\
  \ Tamarisk 22s and 24s were built by North Sea Craft in Norfolk until the moulds\
  \ were sold to North Cornwall Marine where later boats were built. It is thought\
  \ that some 34 boats were built, with &#39;Odd Times III&#39; being the sixth. Her\
  \ OGA registration no. is 3246, 3 for &#39;Odd Times&#39;, 24 for the Tamarisk and\
  \ 6 for the sixth built!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1958 a 23.5&#39; gaff cutter designed\
  \ by John Leather was given the name &#39;Odd Times&#39;. This boat was bought by\
  \ Peter Rose in 1961 who, after crossing the Atlantic, eventually commissioned &#39;Odd\
  \ Times II&#39; in 1968, a 37&#39; gaff cutter, also by John Leather, for further\
  \ Atlantic crossings. &#39;Odd Times III&#39; was commissioned by Rev. Peter Rose\
  \ in 1974 from North Sea Craft of Norfolk. Launched in 1975 she was initially based\
  \ in Yarmouth, cruising the Channel, north French coast and Scilly Isles before\
  \ moving to the Helford River and later Falmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After several more\
  \ owners &#39;Odd Times III&#39; returned to cruising the Solent and racing/rallying\
  \ with the OGA.</p>"
