  First produced in the early 1970's from one of the last wooden dinghies built by
  master craftsman Alf Last of Cooks Barge Yard, Maldon, it has been evolving ever
  since. Early versions were sold to yacht and smack owners as tenders and many
  shells were fitted out by enthusiastic amateurs. By the late eighties the mould
  was worn out and an injection of cash and enthusiasm was needed.


  Maldon boatbuilder Brian Kennell acquired the mould and rights to produce the
  Smacks Boat. Since then he has been steadily building Smacks Boats for an
  enthusiastic East Coast clientele for the last 25 years. Every boat built by
  Brian has been fitted out to the client's individual specification.
