full_description: "<p>First produced in the early 1970&#39;s from one of the last\
  \ wooden dinghies built by master craftsman Alf Last of Cooks Barge Yard, Maldon,\
  \ it has been evolving ever since. Early versions were sold to yacht and smack owners\
  \ as tenders and many shells were fitted out by enthusiastic amateurs. By the late\
  \ eighties the mould was worn out and an injection of cash and enthusiasm was needed.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Maldon boatbuilder Brian Kennell acquired the mould and rights to produce\
  \ the Smacks Boat. Since then he has been steadily building Smacks Boats for an\
  \ enthusiastic East Coast clientele for the last 25 years. Every boat built by Brian\
  \ has been fitted out to the client&#39;s individual specification.</p>"
