  > The Essex oyster smack 'Katie' was built by Aldous at Brightlingsea in 1889 and was used for working oysters in the Salcott and Tollesbury area until 1930. She was converted to a yacht by Johnson and Jago of Leigh-on-Sea in 1930. She sank due to neglect during the Second World War at Pagglesham and was raised by Frank Shuttlewood after the war, who repaired her and doubled her hull.



  > In 1950 her decks were doubled by Hall at Walton, all the doubling being five-eighths planking laid on tar and horsehair. In 1966 her owner, TN Balfour removed the windlass and replaced it with a winch, renewing the chainplates and some other bits of rigging. The original tie-beam was removed and replaced by half beams attached to square frames fastened all round to stringers. In 1970/71 the rudder was renewed.



  > Since 1968, 'Katie' has been a regular entrant in the OGA East Coast Old Gaffers Race.



  > Whilst her hull lines and sail plan are typical of Aldous boats, she is one of the smaller Colne smacks, being only 30' long, 26' on the waterline and 9' 3" beam with a draft of 3' 6". Normal working sail area is 537 square feet, of which 328 is in the main. The hull is planked in inch and a quarter elm on alternate sawn and bent frames. All her ballast is inside in the form of concrete in the bilges. The fixed bowsprit projects 12' beyond the stem head, and the rigging is simple, with two shrouds each side, looped and siezed at the hounds and secures with lanuards. She has no engine.
