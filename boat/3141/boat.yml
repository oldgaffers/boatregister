  'Susanna' has an interesting history of racing and cruising since the 1950s.

  Built for Mr Thorne in 1936, 'Susanna' was laid up in London during the war. Her
  original engine was a Kelvin Bergius 2 cylinder paraffin. Little is known about
  her first two owners but in 1955 she was sold to Reville Farrell who was the
  state solicitor in Waterford and cruised 'Susanna' on the South coast of Ireland
  and made trips to Brittany and Northern Spain.


  According to Susanna's fifth owner, John McConnell, whilst returning from
  Santander in 1958 Farrell was forced, with his crew Paddy Walshe to heave to for
  36 hours by a severe gale. Reville said if they hadn't run out of whiskey it
  would have been 48. At this point Reville decided he needed something bigger and
  reluctantly sold 'Susanna'. He told the purchaser she had a slightly worn rudder
  gudgeon and a soft spot on the port side of the coach roof. When surveyed the
  report found that apart from these two points she was perfect.


  The new owner John Mc Connell, former Commodore of the Royal Dublin Yacht Club,
  sailed her round to Dun Laoghaire with his wife Maimie and two crew. It took
  them 31 hours to cover the nearly 150 miles. 'Susanna' had been launched with a
  3/4 rig but he replaced the mast with a new 42ft one and converted her to a mast
  head rig. He campaigned her with great suscess in RORC races winning the 1964
  Irish Sea Race ahead of stiff competition (Angus Primrose in 'Green Highlander'
  and Fabius skippered by Cdr. Errol Bruce).


  In 1964 she changed hands once more to an American owner who did not do too well
  in RORC events. He came last in the Fastnet Race, having existed on beer and
  fruit juice as there was a leak in the water tanks before he left the Solent.
  Five years later she was sold again to Alfred Abels. He did not race her but
  cruised, Western Isles, Ireland and Brittany. When his son started work he
  continued to cruise single handed and fitted a roller headsail, auto helm and an
  electric winch. He sailed from her base in Bristol well into his 70s.


  She was beginning to show her age when she was bought by Laurence Gerring in
  1992. The Gerring family worked on the outside in the first part of 1992,
  finding it basically sound but the deck needed re-paying and a new forehatch was
  made out of teak. They sailed the rest of the season. In the winter of 1992-3
  they looked at the accommodation, which was basic, O'Connell altering the
  original to keep the weight down for racing. They sailed her on long summer
  cruises to Brittany.
