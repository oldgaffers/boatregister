full_description: "<p>Built for Mr Thorne in 1936, &#39;Susanna&#39; was laid up in\
  \ London during the war. Her original engine was a Kelvin Bergius 2 cylinder paraffin.\
  \ Little is known about her first two owners but in 1955 she was sold to Reville\
  \ Farrell who was the state solicitor in Waterford and cruised &#39;Susanna&#39;\
  \ on the South coast of Ireland and made trips to Brittany and Northern Spain.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>According to Susanna&#39;s fifth owner, John McConnell, whilst returning\
  \ from Santander in 1958 Farrell was forced, with his crew Paddy Walshe to heave\
  \ to for 36 hours by a severe gale. Reville said if they hadn&#39;t run out of whiskey\
  \ it would have been 48. At this point Reville decided he needed something bigger\
  \ and reluctantly sold &#39;Susanna&#39;. He told the purchaser she had a slightly\
  \ worn rudder gudgeon and a soft spot on the port side of the coach roof. When surveyed\
  \ the report found that apart from these two points she was perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>The new owner John Mc Connell, former Commodore of the Royal Dublin Yacht Club,\
  \ sailed her round to Dun Laoghaire with his wife Maimie and two crew. It took them\
  \ 31 hours to cover the nearly 150 miles. &#39;Susanna&#39; had been launched with\
  \ a 3/4 rig but he replaced the mast with a new 42ft one and converted her to a\
  \ mast head rig. He campaigned her with great suscess in RORC races winning the\
  \ 1964 Irish Sea Race ahead of stiff competition (Angus Primrose in &#39;Green Highlander&#39;\
  \ and Fabius skippered by Cdr. Errol Bruce).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1964 she changed hands\
  \ once more to an American owner who did not do too well in RORC events. He came\
  \ last in the Fastnet Race, having existed on beer and fruit juice as there was\
  \ a leak in the water tanks before he left the Solent. Five years later she was\
  \ sold again to Alfred Abels. He did not race her but cruised, Western Isles, Ireland\
  \ and Brittany. When his son started work he continued to cruise single handed and\
  \ fitted a roller headsail, auto helm and an electric winch. He sailed from her\
  \ base in Bristol well into his 70s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was beginning to show her\
  \ age when she was bought by Laurence Gerring in 1992. The Gerring family worked\
  \ on the outside in the first part of 1992, finding it basically sound but the deck\
  \ needed re-paying and a new forehatch was made out of teak. They sailed the rest\
  \ of the season. In the winter of 1992-3 they looked at the accommodation, which\
  \ was basic, O&#39;Connell altering the original to keep the weight down for racing.\
  \ They sailed her on long summer cruises to Brittany.</p>"
