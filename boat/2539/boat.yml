short_description: <p>&#39;First of April&#39; is an Orwell or Crouch One Design.</p>
full_description: "<p>Her rig dates to 1907 and is faster than 1920s Bermudan rigs.\
  \ The keel is now lifting with bulb, same 4 cwt as original design. Experimenting\
  \ with bendy gaff and carbon spars to develop gaff rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;First\
  \ of April&#39; is an Orwell Corinthian. This class was first designed in 1897 for\
  \ the Orwell Corinthian Yacht Club to provide an easily handled boat that did not\
  \ require paid crew. They were later adopted by the Royal Burnham Yacht Club. By\
  \ 1907 there were ten on the Orwell and six on the Crouch who regularly used to\
  \ sail against each other. By 1996 only &#39;Raffles&#39; remained in sailing order\
  \ and a mould was taken from &#39;May&#39; to form the basis of the updated version\
  \ which can easily be trailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first replica was called &#39;First\
  \ of May&#39;. Apart from the use of modern materials and a lifting keel for easier\
  \ trailing she replicates the original. The &#39;Class&#39; now comprises six boats\
  \ built between 1897 and 2001.</p>"
