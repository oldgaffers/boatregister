short_description: '''First of April'' is an Orwell or Crouch One Design.'
full_description: |-
  Her rig dates to 1907 and is faster than 1920s Bermudan rigs. The keel is now
  lifting with bulb, same 4 cwt as original design. Experimenting with bendy gaff
  and carbon spars to develop gaff rig.


  'First of April' is an Orwell Corinthian. This class was first designed in 1897
  for the Orwell Corinthian Yacht Club to provide an easily handled boat that did
  not require paid crew. They were later adopted by the Royal Burnham Yacht Club.
  By 1907 there were ten on the Orwell and six on the Crouch who regularly used to
  sail against each other. By 1996 only 'Raffles' remained in sailing order and a
  mould was taken from 'May' to form the basis of the updated version which can
  easily be trailed.


  The first replica was called 'First of May'. Apart from the use of modern
  materials and a lifting keel for easier trailing she replicates the original.
  The 'Class' now comprises six boats built between 1897 and 2001.
