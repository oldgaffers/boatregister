short_description: <p>'Dragonfly' is an American built Freedom 33 Cat Ketch built
  1981 of GRP using the balsa cored method of construction making a very strong but
  lighter hull than solid GRP.</p>
full_description: <p>John and Vera Lewis bought 'Dragonfly' in Puerto Rico, 1998.
  After a cruise from there through all the islands down to Trinidad and Tobago, she
  was hauled out for the hurricane season. After relaunching in November, she cruised
  back to St Martin, May 1999. From there she sailed to the Azores, Falmouth and Poole,
  her home port.</p><p>'Dragonfly' has a royal blue hull with gold cove line, white
  cabin trunking and grey non slip deck paint with all exterior teak high gloss varnished.
  She has a traditional long keel traditional with wine glass transom upon which the
  rudder is mounted. Two carbon fibre white painted masts with conventional alloy
  booms carry fully battened main and mizzen. Her sails are hoisted, lowered or reefed
  from the cockpit making for safe handling of all lines.</p>
