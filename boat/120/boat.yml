full_description: "<p>Wonder is an Itchin Ferry built in 1860 by Dan Hatcher. She
  was owned by Charles Nicolay from 1960 when he bought her from Ivan Hatchers&#39;
  estate on the death of his son. She underwent some major restorations at the Newport
  Classic Boat Museum, Isle of Wight, in the 1990s. Shortly after this she was fitted
  with an engine for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sold in 2010 and since
  then her new owner has replaced planking down to the waterline and all suspect frames
  as well as renewing the rudder and building a new mast and gaff. This work was carried
  out by Testers at Hollowshore. She now sails out of the Swale. In 2011 she won the
  OGA East Coast Race.</p>"
