full_description: "<p>Wonder is an Itchin Ferry built in 1860 by Dan Hatcher. She\
  \ was owned by Charles Nicolay from 1960 when he bought her from Ivan Hatchers&#39;\
  \ estate on the death of his son. She underwent some major restorations at the Newport\
  \ Classic Boat Museum, Isle of Wight, in the 1990s. Shortly after this she was fitted\
  \ with an engine for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sold in 2010 and since\
  \ then her new owner has replaced planking down to the waterline and all suspect\
  \ frames as well as renewing the rudder and building a new mast and gaff. This work\
  \ was carried out by Testers at Hollowshore. She now sails out of the Swale. In\
  \ 2011 she won the OGA East Coast Race.</p>"
