short_description: |-
  Skian is an early Memory 19, purchased as a wreck in 2017, rebuilt as a lugger
  with water ballast system, re-cycled Romilly 22 mast and new mainsail and jib,
  launched May 2018.
full_description: |-
  The boat was imported to Castletown, IOM as a shell by the late John Qualtrough
  Snr mid 1970s. He rigged a low-aspect standing lug with a boom and a jib set on
  the bowsprit. He sold it on to Tom Cregeen at Castletown, who later sold it on
  to Alex Merchant at Port St Mary IOM, who re-fitted it with a gaff rig. Alex
  sold it on to a chap who never went to sea and it fell into disrepair, abandoned
  ashore. In late 2017, I bought the soggy wreck, having had my eye on it for some
  time. I already have the gaffer Genesta II, which needs at least two and
  preferably three or four people to sail it, so the retirement plan was to put
  together a boat with a simple rig that could be sailed alone or short-handed
  when the weather permits.

  I like the look of the Romilly 22 mainsail and mast, so set about looking for a
  used mast and was lucky to find one in the NW of England. A pal brought it over
  on top of his trailer yacht. Reading up on the Memory 19, it seems they need 500
  kgs of ballast. I thought that water ballast would be handy. Keeping the boat
  ashore on its trailer, I could let it drain while towing up the slipway and
  reduce the 'shore' weight fast. There's 200 or so photos of this re-build on my
  Facebook page (set to public), among which, the ballast tanks each side of the
  centre-board case can be seen. The 4-inch tubes let the tanks fill a or drain in
  about 30 seconds. The ballast water level just kisses the under side of the
  sealed sole, which in turn is self-draining above for sailing purposes with
  bailers set in wells each side. It works very well, thankfully, as it was an
  experiment from start to finish. As it happens, 600 kgs of ballast goes in,
  which makes the boat solid as a raft, almost doubling its dry weight of 750 kgs,
  including 60 kgs of lead chippings and resin let into the keel voids fore and
  aft of the board case. The Whale gusher pump easily clears the water ballast in
  less than five minutes per side if necessary.

  For light airs, I thought the single standing lug might need a bit of help, so
  decided to lengthen the existing sprit a couple of feet with the jib tacked
  where it was originally on a furler.  The assymetric kite is hauled out to the
  end of the sprit with a tackline in the usual manner. The sprit is also arranged
  to stand upright for use as a crane to hike the mast out of its tapered socket.

  There's no space under the sole to stash the outboard, so it lives on the
  transom, however, this is often a blessing when trying to get through the Calf
  Sound and the wind vanishes on you - quite a lot of currents around the IOM, so
  safety-first!
