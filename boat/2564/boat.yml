full_description: '<p><em>Leven Lady </em>is a slate grey Bayraider 20 which is one
  of a series of GRP boats produced by Swallow Yachts in Cardiff. Ketch rigged, she
  has a hollow wooden mast with wood main, mizzen and fore booms. The mizzen and gaff
  are carbon fibre. An assymetric spinnaker can be flown from a retracting carbon
  pole.</p>

  <p>The unique feature of the Bayraider is the ability to fill bilge tanks with water,
  providing immense stability when required while preserving great speed with empty
  tanks for the more experienced.</p>

  <p>The boat is easy to trail, launch and recover with an active owner''s association
  organising rallies throughout Britain.</p>'
