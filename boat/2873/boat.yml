full_description: |-
  Sea Daisy is a Tamarisk 24 designed by David Cannell and built by North Cornwall
  in 1981. She has a solidly built GRP hull with sheathed wooden topsides and
  wooden spars. She was designed in the style of the traditional late 19 th
  century fishing boats from the Itchen Ferry yards on the Hamble   In 2024 she
  finished a complete professional overhaul with replacement of much of   the
  deck, the mast base, the cockpit and cabin hatch cover. Internally she has been
  completely refurbished and painted.   Compared with other Tamarisk 24’ s she is
  very roomy with a spacious main cabin,   separate heads and a door to the
  forward cabin. The galley area has a fairly new gas two burner with grill but
  room for a cooker with oven. She has berths for 4 with a table that will drop to
  accommodate part of a double berth.   She has a complete suit of sails, warps
  etc. Her engine is a reliable Bukh 10 which will move her up to 6 knots in calm
  waters. Also fine sea legs.   Sea Daisy is fine example of a Tamarisk and a good
  solid seaworthy boat, looking in prime condition.
