  Tony Robinson based his design of the Memory class on the plans he saved being
  burned at the James Yard, Brightlingsea. Roots of the design go back to the
  fishery patrol boats, built by Aldous to protect the Colne oysterbeds. The
  ballast is a mix of sand bags and iron. Jenny Wren VII has a new trailer.
