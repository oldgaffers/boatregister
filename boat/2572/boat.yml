short_description: <p>Tir na n&#39;Og of Howth is a Heard 28 built in 1992 by Gaffers
  and Luggers. Her home port, as her name, is Howth Yacht Club, Dublin Bay.</p>
full_description: '<p>Tir na nOg of Howth''s decks were replaced in 2012. She has
  cruised many times to Scotland and the Outer Hebrides.</p>

  <p>She has sailed several times to the Brest Festivals and cruised all around the
  Irish south coast, Bristol Channel, Welsh Coast, Isle of Man and the South East
  Coast of England.</p>

  <p>She was substantially refitted over the five years from 2015 on with a new Yanmar
  3YM30 engine, plus a new feathering propellor &amp; sterngear. A new Lopolight LED
  tricolour + anchor light was fitted at masthead with new wiring. Her cabin has been
  modified, extended into the heads area, and the mast is now deck mounted and moved
  forward which has balanced the rig.</p>

  <p>All of her sails (apart from the topsail ) have been replaced with new similar
  sails, and her standing &amp; running rigging replaced, with most running rigging
  now reaching the cockpit and controlled by winches &amp; jammers. All of the mast
  hardware has been updated in 316 Stainless steel, ditto the bowsprit, which was
  replaced in 2019.</p>'
