short_description: Built by William Crossfield, Arnside in 1910, *Moya* is a 43ft
  Nobby yacht, based in the Mediterranean.
full_description: "Originally built as a yacht, with luxurious accommodation, reported\
  \ on by Yachting Monthly\njust after her launch, *Moya* started out in Preston,\
  \ and had an engine fitted in 1924.\nIn 1927 she was converted to a yawl, being\
  \ taken to Lancaster in 1929 and after the war\nshe was converted back to cutter\
  \ rig. In the early '50s she was on the Solent and came\n2nd in the Old Boat Class,\
  \ 1975 Fastnet Race.\n\nIn 1988 she was sold in Italy, where she underwent a major\
  \ restoration, and has been\nthere for many years, her home port being Trieste,\
  \ at the north end of the Adriatic\nand then Turkey until 2017 when she was moved\
  \ to Aegina, Greece.\n\n### A wooden gaffer amongst 1,999 GRP Bermudans\n\nby Piero\
  \ Tassinari, in Penarth, South Wales First published in Gaffers Log, June 2007\n\
  \n> It is now the second winter since I moved from Italy, and still ‘Moya’, \nthe\
  \ old Morecambe Bay 43ft gaffer which I have been skippering these last years, \n\
  is being cradled by the smooth waters of the Northern Adriatic. The Bristol Channel\
  \ is \nchallenging from a sailing point of view; the tidal range is a fascinating\
  \ monstrosity \nto a Mediterranean mind, and the brownness of the water holds the\
  \ inscrutability of \ntrue poetry, but... no, I cannot take ‘Moya’ to Wales now.\
  \ I am committed to another \nproject (a typical ‘good restoration opportunity’),\
  \ and, after all, I am not her owner.\n\n> I have sailed her during long summer\
  \ cruises which have taken us from Trieste, \nin the far north end of the Adriatic,\
  \ to the Aegean - 2,000 miles a year. So perfect \ncruises that the epicurean owner\
  \ – alarmed from my reports – has persuaded himself \nthat he prefers the crystal-clear\
  \ waters of Southern Dalmatia and Eptanese to the \nmuddy charms of the Severn.\n\
  \n> ‘Moya’ is a strong boat, gifted with innate elegance and immense character.\
  \ \nAccommodation is slightly cramped, but under sail she has the true pace of a\
  \ little \nship. Thoroughbred qualities, which have made her survive nearly a century\
  \ of sailing.\n It was 1910 when she was launched at Arnside, Lancashire – a creature\
  \ of the renowned \n shipyard of William Crossfield. The French Canals led her to\
  \ the Mediterranean in 1988 \n and, after a fastidious restoration, there she was,\
  \ ready for a new season of cruising \n and racing.\n\n> This last summer was timed\
  \ by the legs of a cruise along Dalmatia, Albania, Apulia, \nthe Ionian Islands\
  \ and the Corinth Channel, just for the sake of a look around the Aegean. \nAnd\
  \ it was a long way to get back in time to take part to the last event of the season,\
  \ \nthe ‘Barcolana’ race in Trieste.\n\n> Now in its 38th year, the ‘Barcolana’\
  \ is an odd race which, with its nearly 2,000 \nentries, is the busiest race, if\
  \ not of the world, at least of the Mediterranean. \nIt started as a family business\
  \ with ten classes subdivided by LOA and no handicaps. \nThe plainness of the formula\
  \ appealed to many competitors, as well as its timing in \nmid-October, the traditional\
  \ end of the sailing season. The growth in popularity \nattracted the big boats,\
  \ starting a virtuous circle that eventually led to the present \nastounding numbers\
  \ and the participation of monsters the like of Alfa Romeo and Skandia.\n\n> The\
  \ starting line is a 2 NM affair, with intermediate buoys, several powerboats and\
  \ \na helicopter running along and back to help keep the alignment. It is impossible,\
  \ of \ncourse, to set the first mark against the wind, so it may happen that all\
  \ the 2,000 \nboats (well, almost all), decide to start on the port tack. This was\
  \ the case this \nyear, with a strong northeasterly Bora blowing straight down the\
  \ hills with gusts \nin the order of 30 knots.\n\n> After the start, a 5-mile run\
  \ downwind, just to attend the rendezvous of the \nfirst mark. You feel like a tuna\
  \ swimming to the chamber-of-death through a labyrinth \nof nets. There is nothing\
  \ left to your choice anymore, apart from keeping as far as\n possible from the\
  \ other boats. And this is usually the moment when our 10 ft Douglas-fir \n bowsprit\
  \ inspires the most reverential looks of awe! Once the first mark is left astern,\n\
  \  the fleet disperses and you generally end up by racing your private competition\
  \ against\n   the boats nearby.\n\n> The observance of the rules of the road is\
  \ of the utmost importance. But the rules \nalone are not enough, and you know you\
  \ are going to take risks. Since the space\n for evolutions is so small, the understanding\
  \ between skippers is essential. Some \n unorthodox manoeuvres are often the most\
  \ effective – if they fail, catastrophe can be \n quite close.\n\n> We approached\
  \ the verge of disaster when a small cruiser on the starboard tack boldly\nchanged\
  \ course as if she meant to pass astern of us – giving way to the bigger vessel\
  \ \nis common practice in this race. After a while, however, she headed up again\
  \ toward us.\nWe lost precious moments when ‘Moya’ did not answer to the helm hardly\
  \ pressed windward:\nthe sheet had jammed and for few long seconds we were unable\
  \ to ease the main. We \nbore away in the end, but our faces turned grey when we\
  \ missed her stern by only a\nfew inches – all of us aboard were thinking at the\
  \ effect of a collision between an\n18-ton gaffer sailing at 7 knots and a small\
  \ GRP family cruiser!\n\n> So, what is the point of taking part to such an over-crammed\
  \ event, irrelevant in \ncompetitive terms and potentially dangerous?\n\n> Maybe\
  \ it is the astonishing participation of the community, a collective urge to \n\
  take part in a unique meeting, that for a weekend makes Trieste again the Mediterranean\
  \ \ncapital of sail.\n\n> Maybe it is the rare chance of testing the behaviour of\
  \ such different crafts \nracing against each other.\n\n> Maybe it is the pride\
  \ of sailing our superb gaffer and the complacency for the\n compliments paid to\
  \ her beauty. The owner, a well-mannered person, usually smiles\n  politely in acknowledgement.\
  \ But when the skipper of a Bavaria told him how nice she \n  was he could not help\
  \ replying what we all were secretly thinking: “Sorry mate, \n  no matter how I\
  \ try, but cannot honestly say the same.”\n\nIn late September, 2017, Piero Tassinari\
  \ died of a brain tumour; he knew that he was \nill, yet his death was unexpected.\n\
  \n#### from 'Severn Tidings', newsletter of the Bristol Channel OGA\n\n> Piero loved\
  \ the sea, be it the Aegean or the Bristol Channel, and was a member \nof the OGA\
  \ for ten years or more. He owned the 1910 Morecambe Bay Prawner Moya\nwhich he\
  \ kept in Turkey. In the summer 2017, he brought *Moya* across the Aegean \nSea\
  \ to Greece on a project to trace the Greek myth of Europe on her journey from \n\
  Asia. Amongst his crew were a journalist and a professional cameraman.\n\n> A sixty-minute\
  \ documentary film was made of the voyage. A haunting and beautiful \nfilm that\
  \ combines dialogues with Piero, demonstrating his deep knowledge of Ancient\nHistory,\
  \ with encounters of the people he met ashore as he searched for the answer \nto\
  \ the simple question of ‘what is Europe?’. All this set against beautiful imagery\
  \ of \n*Moya* and the passing sea and landscapes. This quest, so symptomatic of\
  \ the man, \nturned out to be his own last voyage.\n<iframe src=\"https://www.repubblica.it/embed/dossier/cultura/super-8/2017/09/01/video/super_8_il_viaggio_di_rumiz_nel_mare_egeo_alla_ricerca_di_europa-423034975/\"\
