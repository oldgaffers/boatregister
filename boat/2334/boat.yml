short_description: Built by William Crossfield, Arnside in 1910, *Moya* is a 43ft
  Nobby yacht, based in the Mediterranean.
full_description: |-
  Originally built as a yacht, with luxurious accommodation, reported on by Yachting Monthly
  just after her launch, *Moya* started out in Preston, and had an engine fitted in 1924.
  In 1927 she was converted to a yawl, being taken to Lancaster in 1929 and after the war
  she was converted back to cutter rig. In the early '50s she was on the Solent and came
  2nd in the Old Boat Class, 1975 Fastnet Race.

  In 1988 she was sold in Italy, where she underwent a major restoration, and has been
  there for many years, her home port being Trieste, at the north end of the Adriatic
  and then Turkey until 2017 when she was moved to Aegina, Greece.

  ### A wooden gaffer amongst 1,999 GRP Bermudans

  by Piero Tassinari, in Penarth, South Wales First published in Gaffers Log, June 2007

  > It is now the second winter since I moved from Italy, and still ‘Moya’, 
  the old Morecambe Bay 43ft gaffer which I have been skippering these last years, 
  is being cradled by the smooth waters of the Northern Adriatic. The Bristol Channel is 
  challenging from a sailing point of view; the tidal range is a fascinating monstrosity 
  to a Mediterranean mind, and the brownness of the water holds the inscrutability of 
  true poetry, but... no, I cannot take ‘Moya’ to Wales now. I am committed to another 
  project (a typical ‘good restoration opportunity’), and, after all, I am not her owner.

  > I have sailed her during long summer cruises which have taken us from Trieste, 
  in the far north end of the Adriatic, to the Aegean - 2,000 miles a year. So perfect 
  cruises that the epicurean owner – alarmed from my reports – has persuaded himself 
  that he prefers the crystal-clear waters of Southern Dalmatia and Eptanese to the 
  muddy charms of the Severn.

  > ‘Moya’ is a strong boat, gifted with innate elegance and immense character. 
  Accommodation is slightly cramped, but under sail she has the true pace of a little 
  ship. Thoroughbred qualities, which have made her survive nearly a century of sailing.
   It was 1910 when she was launched at Arnside, Lancashire – a creature of the renowned 
   shipyard of William Crossfield. The French Canals led her to the Mediterranean in 1988 
   and, after a fastidious restoration, there she was, ready for a new season of cruising 
   and racing.

  > This last summer was timed by the legs of a cruise along Dalmatia, Albania, Apulia, 
  the Ionian Islands and the Corinth Channel, just for the sake of a look around the Aegean. 
  And it was a long way to get back in time to take part to the last event of the season, 
  the ‘Barcolana’ race in Trieste.

  > Now in its 38th year, the ‘Barcolana’ is an odd race which, with its nearly 2,000 
  entries, is the busiest race, if not of the world, at least of the Mediterranean. 
  It started as a family business with ten classes subdivided by LOA and no handicaps. 
  The plainness of the formula appealed to many competitors, as well as its timing in 
  mid-October, the traditional end of the sailing season. The growth in popularity 
  attracted the big boats, starting a virtuous circle that eventually led to the present 
  astounding numbers and the participation of monsters the like of Alfa Romeo and Skandia.

  > The starting line is a 2 NM affair, with intermediate buoys, several powerboats and 
  a helicopter running along and back to help keep the alignment. It is impossible, of 
  course, to set the first mark against the wind, so it may happen that all the 2,000 
  boats (well, almost all), decide to start on the port tack. This was the case this 
  year, with a strong northeasterly Bora blowing straight down the hills with gusts 
  in the order of 30 knots.

  > After the start, a 5-mile run downwind, just to attend the rendezvous of the 
  first mark. You feel like a tuna swimming to the chamber-of-death through a labyrinth 
  of nets. There is nothing left to your choice anymore, apart from keeping as far as
   possible from the other boats. And this is usually the moment when our 10 ft Douglas-fir 
   bowsprit inspires the most reverential looks of awe! Once the first mark is left astern,
    the fleet disperses and you generally end up by racing your private competition against
     the boats nearby.

  > The observance of the rules of the road is of the utmost importance. But the rules 
  alone are not enough, and you know you are going to take risks. Since the space
   for evolutions is so small, the understanding between skippers is essential. Some 
   unorthodox manoeuvres are often the most effective – if they fail, catastrophe can be 
   quite close.

  > We approached the verge of disaster when a small cruiser on the starboard tack boldly
  changed course as if she meant to pass astern of us – giving way to the bigger vessel 
  is common practice in this race. After a while, however, she headed up again toward us.
  We lost precious moments when ‘Moya’ did not answer to the helm hardly pressed windward:
  the sheet had jammed and for few long seconds we were unable to ease the main. We 
  bore away in the end, but our faces turned grey when we missed her stern by only a
  few inches – all of us aboard were thinking at the effect of a collision between an
  18-ton gaffer sailing at 7 knots and a small GRP family cruiser!

  > So, what is the point of taking part to such an over-crammed event, irrelevant in 
  competitive terms and potentially dangerous?

  > Maybe it is the astonishing participation of the community, a collective urge to 
  take part in a unique meeting, that for a weekend makes Trieste again the Mediterranean 
  capital of sail.

  > Maybe it is the rare chance of testing the behaviour of such different crafts 
  racing against each other.

  > Maybe it is the pride of sailing our superb gaffer and the complacency for the
   compliments paid to her beauty. The owner, a well-mannered person, usually smiles
    politely in acknowledgement. But when the skipper of a Bavaria told him how nice she 
    was he could not help replying what we all were secretly thinking: “Sorry mate, 
    no matter how I try, but cannot honestly say the same.”

  In late September, 2017, Piero Tassinari died of a brain tumour; he knew that he was 
  ill, yet his death was unexpected.

  #### from 'Severn Tidings', newsletter of the Bristol Channel OGA

  > Piero loved the sea, be it the Aegean or the Bristol Channel, and was a member 
  of the OGA for ten years or more. He owned the 1910 Morecambe Bay Prawner Moya
  which he kept in Turkey. In the summer 2017, he brought *Moya* across the Aegean 
  Sea to Greece on a project to trace the Greek myth of Europe on her journey from 
  Asia. Amongst his crew were a journalist and a professional cameraman.
  
  > A sixty-minute documentary film was made of the voyage. A haunting and beautiful 
  film that combines dialogues with Piero, demonstrating his deep knowledge of Ancient
  History, with encounters of the people he met ashore as he searched for the answer 
  to the simple question of ‘what is Europe?’. All this set against beautiful imagery of 
  *Moya* and the passing sea and landscapes. This quest, so symptomatic of the man, 
  turned out to be his own last voyage.
