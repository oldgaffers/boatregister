full_description: "<p>Originally built as a yacht, with luxurious accommodation, reported\
  \ on by Yachting Monthly just after her launch, &#39;Moya&#39; started out in Preston,\
  \ and had an engine fitted in 1924. In 1927 she was converted to a yawl, being taken\
  \ to Lancaster in 1929 and after the war she was converted back to cutter rig. In\
  \ the early &#39;50s she was on the Solent and came 2nd in the Old Boat Class, 1975\
  \ Fastnet Race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1988 she was sold in Italy, where she underwent\
  \ a major restoration, and has been there ever since, her home port being Trieste,\
  \ at the north end of the Adriatic and then Turkey until 2017 when she was moved\
  \ to Aegina, Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A wooden gaffer amongst 1,999 GRP Bermudans</h3>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>by Piero Tassinari, in Penarth, South Wales First published in Gaffers\
  \ Log, June 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It is now the second winter since I moved\
  \ from Italy, and still &lsquo;Moya&rsquo;, the old Morecambe Bay 43ft gaffer which\
  \ I have been skippering these last years, is being cradled by the smooth waters\
  \ of the Northern Adriatic. The Bristol Channel is challenging from a sailing point\
  \ of view; the tidal range is a fascinating monstrosity to a Mediterranean mind,\
  \ and the brownness of the water holds the inscrutability of true poetry, but...\
  \ no, I cannot take &lsquo;Moya&rsquo; to Wales now. I am committed to another project\
  \ (a typical &lsquo;good restoration opportunity&rsquo;), and, after all, I am not\
  \ her owner.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I have sailed her during long summer\
  \ cruises which have taken us from Trieste, in the far north end of the Adriatic,\
  \ to the Aegean - 2,000 miles a year. So perfect cruises that the epicurean owner\
  \ &ndash; alarmed from my reports &ndash; has persuaded himself that he prefers\
  \ the crystal-clear waters of Southern Dalmatia and Eptanese to the muddy charms\
  \ of the Severn.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Moya&rsquo; is a strong\
  \ boat, gifted with innate elegance and immense character. Accommodation is slightly\
  \ cramped, but under sail she has the true pace of a little ship. Thoroughbred qualities,\
  \ which have made her survive nearly a century of sailing. It was 1910 when she\
  \ was launched at Arnside, Lancashire &ndash; a creature of the renowned shipyard\
  \ of William Crossfield. The French Canals led her to the Mediterranean in 1988\
  \ and, after a fastidious restoration, there she was, ready for a new season of\
  \ cruising and racing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This last summer was timed\
  \ by the legs of a cruise along Dalmatia, Albania, Apulia, the Ionian Islands and\
  \ the Corinth Channel, just for the sake of a look around the Aegean. And it was\
  \ a long way to get back in time to take part to the last event of the season, the\
  \ &lsquo;Barcolana&rsquo; race in Trieste.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Now in\
  \ its 38th year, the &lsquo;Barcolana&rsquo; is an odd race which, with its nearly\
  \ 2,000 entries, is the busiest race, if not of the world, at least of the Mediterranean.\
  \ It started as a family business with ten classes subdivided by LOA and no handicaps.\
  \ The plainness of the formula appealed to many competitors, as well as its timing\
  \ in mid-October, the traditional end of the sailing season. The growth in popularity\
  \ attracted the big boats, starting a virtuous circle that eventually led to the\
  \ present astounding numbers and the participation of monsters the like of Alfa\
  \ Romeo and Skandia.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The starting line is a 2 NM\
  \ affair, with intermediate buoys, several powerboats and a helicopter running along\
  \ and back to help keep the alignment. It is impossible, of course, to set the first\
  \ mark against the wind, so it may happen that all the 2,000 boats (well, almost\
  \ all), decide to start on the port tack. This was the case this year, with a strong\
  \ northeasterly Bora blowing straight down the hills with gusts in the order of\
  \ 30 knots.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>After the start, a 5-mile run downwind,\
  \ just to attend the rendezvous of the first mark. You feel like a tuna swimming\
  \ to the chamber-of-death through a labyrinth of nets. There is nothing left to\
  \ your choice anymore, apart from keeping as far as possible from the other boats.\
  \ And this is usually the moment when our 10 ft Douglas-fir bowsprit inspires the\
  \ most reverential looks of awe! Once the first mark is left astern, the fleet disperses\
  \ and you generally end up by racing your private competition against the boats\
  \ nearby.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The observance of the rules of the road\
  \ is of the utmost importance. But the rules alone are not enough, and you know\
  \ you are going to take risks. Since the space for evolutions is so small, the understanding\
  \ between skippers is essential. Some unorthodox manoeuvres are often the most effective\
  \ &ndash; if they fail, catastrophe can be quite close.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We\
  \ approached the verge of disaster when a small cruiser on the starboard tack boldly\
  \ changed course as if she meant to pass astern of us &ndash; giving way to the\
  \ bigger vessel is common practice in this race. After a while, however, she headed\
  \ up again toward us. We lost precious moments when &lsquo;Moya&rsquo; did not answer\
  \ to the helm hardly pressed windward: the sheet had jammed and for few long seconds\
  \ we were unable to ease the main. We bore away in the end, but our faces turned\
  \ grey when we missed her stern by only a few inches &ndash; all of us aboard were\
  \ thinking at the effect of a collision between an 18-ton gaffer sailing at 7 knots\
  \ and a small GRP family cruiser!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>So, what is the\
  \ point of taking part to such an over-crammed event, irrelevant in competitive\
  \ terms and potentially dangerous?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Maybe it is the\
  \ astonishing participation of the community, a collective urge to take part in\
  \ a unique meeting, that for a weekend makes Trieste again the Mediterranean capital\
  \ of sail.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Maybe it is the rare chance of testing\
  \ the behaviour of such different crafts racing against each other.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Maybe it is the pride of sailing our superb gaffer and the complacency\
  \ for the compliments paid to her beauty. The owner, a well-mannered person, usually\
  \ smiles politely in acknowledgement. But when the skipper of a Bavaria told him\
  \ how nice she was he could not help replying what we all were secretly thinking:\
  \ &ldquo;Sorry mate, no matter how I try, but cannot honestly say the same.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In late September, 2017, Piero Tassinari died of a brain tumour; he knew\
  \ that he was ill, yet his death was unexpected.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>from &#39;Severn\
  \ Tidings&#39;, newsletter of the Bristol Channel OGA</h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\
  \n<p>Piero loved the sea, be it the Aegean or the Bristol Channel, and was a member\
  \ of the OGA for ten years or more. He owned the 1910 Morecambe Bay Prawner Moya\
  \ which he kept in Turkey. In the summer 2017, he brought &#39;Moya&#39; across\
  \ the Aegean Sea to Greece on a project to trace the Greek myth of Europe on her\
  \ journey from Asia. Amongst his crew were a journalist and a professional cameraman.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>A sixty-minute documentary film was made of the voyage. A haunting and\
  \ beautiful film that combines dialogues with Piero, demonstrating his deep knowledge\
  \ of Ancient History, with encounters of the people he met ashore as he searched\
  \ for the answer to the simple question of &lsquo;what is Europe?&rsquo;. All this\
  \ set against beautiful imagery of &#39;Moya&#39; and the passing sea and landscapes.\
  \ This quest, so symptomatic of the man, turned out to be his own last voyage.</p>\r\
