full_description: "<p>Bob Spackman bought the derelict hull off the beach at Prinstead,\
  \ Chichester Harbour in 1990. He spent three years restoring her and launched &#39;Phoenix&#39;\
  \ in spring 1993. He made the mast and spars himself and bought a set of sails second\
  \ hand from a Norfolk One Design which have proved admirable in terms of sail area,\
  \ power and aesthetics. Her hull is fibreglass, heavy construction with a wooden\
  \ gunwale. It is decked forward of the mast and has an oak bowsprit. There are buoyancy\
  \ tanks inbuilt port and starboard in the stern half of the boat and a large buoyancy\
  \ tank under the foredeck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012 she needed significant work, mainly\
  \ a new keel and scarfing a new section on the mast that had rotted.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>She is mainly sailed in Chichester Harbour but Bob has trailed her to the Baltic,\
  \ West Coast of Scotland, Gulf of Morbihan, France, Roseland Peninsula and the OGA\
  \ Trailer Section rally in Norfolk, 2014.</p>"
