short_description: Aurora is a Cape Cutter 19 built in Rochdale by Bob Brown at Honnor
  Marine. She is currently based on the Solent.
full_description: The second owners have sailed her since 2012. Being a trailer sailer,
  they have been able to visit a number of different sailing areas in the UK, as well
  as spending a summer in the Baltic. The Cape Cutter 19 was designed by Dudley Dix
  to be the maximum size that two hulls could be shipped within a standard 40' shipping
  container from its original construction site in Cape Town, South Africa. Later
  boats were built in Rochdale at Honnor Marine. The Cape Cutter has a bluff bow and
  a generous cockpit with an outboard in a well. Her lowish coachroof gives her pretty
  lines, and yet clever internal layout makes full use of the internal volume. They
  carry a high-peaked mainsail, staysail and either genoa or yankee foresail.
