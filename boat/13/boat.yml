full_description: |-
  Named *Trix* until 1946 when she was re-named *Thistle*,
  *Lady Trix* is a one off lightweight racing yacht designed by Alfred Mylne
  and built on the Clyde, Scotland in 1909. She often raced in the 1950s with the
  6 metre class. She was taken to France in the 1990s.
  
  In 2006, she was entrusted to Bruno Barbara (Candela) for restoration and renamed again, *Lady Trix*.

  In August 2008, at Noirmoutier, the 6mJI *Elfe* holed *Lady Trix* amidships,
  causing significant damage.In 2009, her centenary
  year, she celebrated in style. Invited by H.S.H Prince Albert, and with Bruno
  Peyron at the helm, *Lady Trix* came in second at the Monaco Classic
  Week and also won the *Voiles de Saint-Tropez*.

  ** Recollections from David Johnston, June 2018

  I sailed on her in the early 1970s along with my father, Bill Johnston, who
  is now aged 87.  My father was a member of her regular racing crew from about
  1971 to 1975 when *Thistle* was owned by Dr Andrew Motherwell and raced
  from Royal Gourock Yacht Club.  When Andrew emigrated to Australia
  he sold her to Dr Jimmy Buchanan who kept her at Otter Ferry. A few years later
  Jimmy sold her to the Coghill family who gave it as a wedding present to their
  son Frank &amp; Jenny (nee Lee). I sailed on her occasionally with Frank &amp;
  Jenny. She was based at Cardwell Bay Sailing Club in Gourock at the time.
  Coming back to my father's connection, when he first sailed with
  his friend Andrew Motherwell, he was surprised and delighted to find he already
  knew the boat. Dad had in fact sailed on her as a young man in the late 1940s
  when she was owned by his friend Sandy Denny, whose family owned Denny&rsquo;s
  shipyard in Dumbarton.More recently, *Thistle* was restored
  by a French boatyard and raced - by Bruno Peyron, no less - on the Mediterranean
  classic yacht regatta circuit. She was re-named *Lady Trix*, after her
  original 1909 name of *Trix*.  In fact her rudder post, when I sailed
  on her in the 1970s, still had the name *Trix* engraved into the brass
  top fitting. It seems she was hit by a 6 metre and holed badly
  in a regatta at Antibes. There were magazine reports and photographs of the collision,
  and I have not heard of her since. The magazine articles of the collision, as
  well as an article describing the lengthy restoration project, may be found on
  the internet by googling &ldquo;Lady Trix yacht&rdquo;.I believed
  she was built for Lady Coats (wife of a scion of the Paisley thread-making dynasty),
  but there is another story that she was built for the wife of a Glasgow steel
  magnate who was well known to Alfred Mylne, the designer.

  I hope this provides a little more colour about this wonderful boat. She handled
  beautifully and was a joy to sail. She was the first yacht I sailed on and I have
  very happy memories of sailing and racing her in my early teens with Andrew and
  my Dad.With warm memories, David Johnston

    distinguished himself by winning the 12 metre gold at the 1908 Olympics. The

    Although there is a certain roundness to this version, that does not necessarily
