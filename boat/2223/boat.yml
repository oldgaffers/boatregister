full_description: |-
  'William' is named after the 'Sir William Priestley', the Morecambe Fisherman’s
  lifeboat.

  She is one of the glass fibre replicas taken from the mould of 'Sir William'
  made by Eric Bergqvist. Though the hull was sold by Eric Bergqvist in 1984, the
  fitting out was not finished till 1992. 'William' has been kept at
  Burnham-on-Crouch since 1998 and sails in the Thames Estuary area between Dover
  and Woodbridge.

  The stability and windward performance of 'William' has been improved by adding
  16 foot of lead and glassing onto the bottom of the keel. The original mould was
  made without the iron shoe, making the keel about 4 inches shallower, affecting
  stability and windward performance.

  In 1984, the hull was sold by Eric Bergqvist to her first owner in Torpoint,
  Devon. The owner spent six years fitting her out in his garden, but never sailed
  her.

  She was sold to an owner in West Mersea, Essex, in about 1990 who finished off
  the rig, ballast and fitting out by about 1992.

  In 1998 she was sold again to an owner based in London who keeps her in
  Burnham-on-Crouch. New hatches have been added and her interior rebuilt. Loose
  lead was taken out and recast as an extension to the keel making her draught
  about 3ft 9in, much improving stability and windward performance. A new mast and
  spars in aluminium have been installed, painted brown.
