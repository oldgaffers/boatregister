short_description: <p>Snoopy was converted from a ship&#39;s lifeboat by the current
  owner. He has sailed her single-handed to the Azores and back as well as around
  Britain from the Netherlands twice.</p>
full_description: "<p>Snoopy was originally built in Rotterdam, as lifeboat no 5 for\
  \ MPV Noordam, 1946-1963 and then Nova Z from 1967-1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was purchased\
  \ by her current owner and converted for use as a single-handed cruising yacht.\
  \ She has sailed round Britain clockwise from the Netherlands, through the Scottish\
  \ canals, with a small extension from Falmouth via the Azores to Kinsale, Ireland.\
  \ When planning to take part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge, 2013, the skipper\
  \ decided to sail counter-clockwise, starting from Holland and crossing to Whitby\
  \ directly, resulting in a trip to Cowes of around 1400 miles before returning to\
  \ the Netherlands. The log of this passage is on <a href=\"http://www.sailing-by.org.uk/content/snoopy-counter-clockwise-circumnavigation-britain-2013\"\
