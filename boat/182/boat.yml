short_description: |-
  A Royal Mersey Restricted Class yacht with an extensive cruising and racing
  history.
full_description: |-
  This fast gaffer was successfully raced on the South Coast for 15 years and is
  reputed to have made the first single-handed circumnavigation of Britain.
  Completely restored in 1974 with new deck, superstructure, accommodation, spars,
  etc.

  In 1976 her owners completed a two year cruise of the Mediterranean before
  leaving her in Malta.

  Her 1977 fit out included: Seven sails, all terylene except jib which is fitted
  with roller furling gear. Four berths, settee, table, enclosed head, galley
  fitted with gas cooker, sink, water pump and spacious stowage. Depth sounder,
  RDF, log, compass and all required equipment required for extensive cruising.
  Seagull Century P plus auxilliary. Hutchinson inflatable tender. We have no
  records of her after 1977 when she was for sale lying Malta. One of two RMRC
  boats built by the EnterPrise Small Craft Company, the other being Coral. This
  anecdote extracted from Phyllis' website: “One of them, I think AYESHA, parted
  her centreplate hoist wire. They were cased in and very liable to be neglected,
  and as their plate had no limit stops it dangled from its pin, became bent, and
  would not come up when underrun. She had to be craned out in Liverpool docks.
  There is a lesson here – I’ve never rigged a centre plate without a stop since!”
