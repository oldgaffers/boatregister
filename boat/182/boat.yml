short_description: A Royal Mersey Restricted Class yacht with an extensive cruising
  and racing history.
full_description: "This fast gaffer was successfully raced on the South Coast for\
  \ 15 years and is reputed to have made the first single-handed circumnavigation\
  \ of Britain.  Completely restored in 1974 with new deck, superstructure, accommodation,\
  \ spars, etc.<p> In 1976 her owners completed a two year cruise of the Mediterranean\
  \ before leaving her in Malta.<p> Her 1977 fit out included:  Seven sails, all terylene\
  \ except jib which is fitted with roller furling gear. Four berths, settee, table,\
  \ enclosed head, galley fitted with gas cooker, sink, water pump and spacious stowage.\
  \ Depth sounder, RDF, log, compass and all required equipment required for extensive\
  \ cruising. Seagull Century P plus auxilliary. Hutchinson inflatable tender. We\
  \ have no records of her after 1977 when she was for sale lying Malta. One of two\
  \ RMRC boats built by the EnterPrise Small Craft Company, the other being Coral.\
  \ This anecdote extracted from Phyllis' website: &ldquot;One of them, I think AYESHA,\
  \ parted her centreplate hoist wire. They were cased in and very liable to be neglected,\
  \ and as their plate had no limit stops it dangled from its pin, became bent, and\
  \ would not come up when underrun. She had to be craned out in Liverpool docks.\
  \ There is a lesson here \u2013 I\u2019ve never rigged a centre plate without a\
  \ stop since!&rdquot;"
