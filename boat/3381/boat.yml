full_description: This little dinghy was built for rowing and gently pottering about
  under sail on the River Yealm.<p>The positions of the thwarts have been changed
  on this boat from the original design (with the approval of the designer), so that
  she balances properly for rowing with just one person on board.<p>The rig is a balanced
  lug sail.<p>She won the Watercraft award for the most professional-looking home-built
  boat at the Beale Park Boat Show 2018.
