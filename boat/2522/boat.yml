full_description: "<p>Sula&#39;s design by John Leather was inspired by the designs\
  \ of Colin Archer. She has cruised to Norway, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal and\
  \ Morocco, being based in Portugal for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her engine was\
  \ rebuilt with new head and piston rings in 2014. The hull epoxy coated from new,\
  \ she had two&nbsp;further epoxy coats in 2014 prior to applying Coppercoat antifouling\
  \ which should last until 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her running rigging is continuously\
  \ replaced and standing rigging, 8mm galvanized, stored in linseed oil evey winter.\
  \ The jib has a new UV strip and the 55W flexi solar panel mounted on the forehatch\
  \ just about keeps up with the keel cooled fridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&#39;s a very\
  \ comfortable small cruiser whether hove-to,&nbsp;sitting out a F8 off the Norwegian\
  \ coast or at anchor on the Algarve coast. A great sea boat with a proven pedigree.</p>\r\

  \n\r\n<p>In 2017 she had a new Beta marine 25 HP Diesel engine.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\
