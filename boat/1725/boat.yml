short_description: A fine example of a Tamarisk 24 class topsail gaff cutter.
full_description: |-
  The Tamarisk is 24ft long (plus a 6ft bowsprit), 8ft in beam, 3ft in draft and displaces about 3 tons. She is a long keel design so there’s no centreboard taking up cabin space, and there’s reasonable standing headroom in the main accommodation.  Above deck the spars are all well-varnished wood and there are four sails in good condition: jib (82 sq ft), staysail (71), main (182) and topsail (31). The topsail sets on the mast without the need for an additional yard and when set, although small, it usually adds half a knot to the boat’s speed!  The foresails are on roller reefing stays and the main is very simple to set or reef.  All the standing and running rigging was been replaced when we bought the boat and is in excellent condition.From the generously sized aft cockpit, steps lead down to the main cabin which
  has full length berths port and starboard with a folding leaf table between.
   This can be used for chart work as well as meals.  Forward of the port berth is
  the galley with a Taylor’s two-burner paraffin cooker, a stainless steel sink
  and secure stowage for crockery etc..  Opposite the galley, to starboard, is a
  separate heads compartment equipped with a Jabsco sea toilet. There is ample
  storage on shelves and in lockers under the berths and in the galley and heads.
   A Taylor’s paraffin cabin heater adds comfort on chillier evenings.  Forward of
  the main cabin, in the fore cabin where there is sitting headroom, are two
  further full-length berths with storage lockers underneath.  From here there is
  an opening hatch to the deck and access to the chain locker.  Each berth is
  equipped with an LED reading light.

  The steps down into the main cabin can be lifted out to give access to the
  recent Vetus M2-D5 13hp diesel engine that has run about 700 hours and is in
  excellent condition.  At 2000rpm this gives a speed of 5 knots in smooth water.
   As well as providing motive power the engine charges two lead-acid batteries,
  one dedicated to engine starting and the other for lighting and instrumentation.
   The engine control panel, which includes a rev counter and oil pressure gauge,
  is fitted in a recess in the cockpit.

  Navigation equipment includes steering and hand bearing compasses, NASA Clipper
  wind, speed and depth instruments, a Garmin 126 GPS and a Yeoman Sport chart
  plotter that uses A2 size Admiralty Leisure charts.  The GPS and plotter are
  linked together to provide a really versatile facility whereby, for example,
  waypoints marked on the chart can be instantly transferred to the GPS display in
  the cockpit, and the current GPS position is constantly available on the chart.
   The GPS is also permanently linked to the NASA SX35 DSC VHF set to provide
  positional information in the event of an emergency.  A NASA Navtex receiver is
  also fitted.

  Deck gear includes all necessary warps and fenders, a 26lb CQR with and a
  Danforth kedge both with ground chains and nylon cables.  A 1.8m Plastimo rowing
  inflatable can be stowed deflated on deck or towed astern.  There is a horseshoe
  lifebuoy and two cockpit seat cushions that can also provide emergency
  flotation.  Fire extinguishers to BSS standards are fitted.
