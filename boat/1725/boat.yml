short_description: A fine example of a Tamarisk 24 class topsail gaff cutter.
full_description: 'The Tamarisk is 24ft long (plus a 6ft bowsprit), 8ft in beam, 3ft
  in draft and displaces about 3 tons. She is a long keel design so there&rsquo;s
  no centreboard taking up cabin space, and there&rsquo;s reasonable standing headroom
  in the main accommodation. &nbsp;Above deck the spars are all well-varnished wood
  and there are four sails in good condition: jib (82 sq ft), staysail (71), main
  (182) and topsail (31). The topsail sets on the mast without the need for an additional
  yard and when set, although small, it usually adds half a knot to the boat&rsquo;s
  speed! &nbsp;The foresails are on roller reefing stays and the main is very simple
  to set or reef. &nbsp;All the standing and running rigging was been replaced when
  we bought the boat and is in excellent condition.</p><p>From the generously sized
  aft cockpit, steps lead down to the main cabin which has full length berths port
  and starboard with a folding leaf table between. &nbsp;This can be used for chart
  work as well as meals. &nbsp;Forward of the port berth is the galley with a Taylor&rsquo;s
  two-burner paraffin cooker, a stainless steel sink and secure stowage for crockery
  etc.. &nbsp;Opposite the galley, to starboard, is a separate heads compartment equipped
  with a Jabsco sea toilet. There is ample storage on shelves and in lockers under
  the berths and in the galley and heads. &nbsp;A Taylor&rsquo;s paraffin cabin heater
  adds comfort on chillier evenings. &nbsp;Forward of the main cabin, in the fore
  cabin where there is sitting headroom, are two further full-length berths with storage
  lockers underneath. &nbsp;From here there is an opening hatch to the deck and access
  to the chain locker. &nbsp;Each berth is equipped with an LED reading light.</p><p>The
  steps down into the main cabin can be lifted out to give access to the recent Vetus
  M2-D5 13hp diesel engine that has run about 700 hours and is in excellent condition.
  &nbsp;At 2000rpm this gives a speed of 5 knots in smooth water. &nbsp;As well as
  providing motive power the engine charges two lead-acid batteries, one dedicated
  to engine starting and the other for lighting and instrumentation. &nbsp;The engine
  control panel, which includes a rev counter and oil pressure gauge, is fitted in
  a recess in the cockpit.</p><p>Navigation equipment includes steering and hand bearing
  compasses, NASA Clipper wind, speed and depth instruments, a Garmin 126 GPS and
  a Yeoman Sport chart plotter that uses A2 size Admiralty Leisure charts. &nbsp;The
  GPS and plotter are linked together to provide a really versatile facility whereby,
  for example, waypoints marked on the chart can be instantly transferred to the GPS
  display in the cockpit, and the current GPS position is constantly available on
  the chart. &nbsp;The GPS is also permanently linked to the NASA SX35 DSC VHF set
  to provide positional information in the event of an emergency. &nbsp;A NASA Navtex
  receiver is also fitted.</p><p>Deck gear includes all necessary warps and fenders,
  a 26lb CQR with and a Danforth kedge both with ground chains and nylon cables. &nbsp;A
  1.8m Plastimo rowing inflatable can be stowed deflated on deck or towed astern.
  &nbsp;There is a horseshoe lifebuoy and two cockpit seat cushions that can also
  provide emergency flotation. &nbsp;Fire extinguishers to BSS standards are fitted.'
