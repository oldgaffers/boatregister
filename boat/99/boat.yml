full_description: "<p>&#39;Growler&#39;&nbsp;was built at Conyer Creek in 1922, reputedly\
  \ a 1/3 sized version of the Thames barge &#39;Sara&#39;. She spent the majority\
  \ of her life cruising on the River Swale and around the Thames estuary. By the\
  \ early 1990s she had fallen into a state of neglect and was rescued by Gus Curtis\
  \ of Harry Kings Boatyard, Pin Mill. He then passed her on to Ash Faire-Ring who\
  \ plans to restore her back to full working order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"\
