full_description: |-
  'Growler' was built at Conyer Creek in 1922, reputedly a 1/3 sized version of
  the Thames barge 'Sara'. She spent the majority of her life cruising on the
  River Swale and around the Thames estuary. By the early 1990s she had fallen
  into a state of neglect and was rescued by Gus Curtis of Harry Kings Boatyard,
  Pin Mill. He then passed her on to Ash Faire-Ring who has now relaunched her and
  she is sailing again. Well done Ash!
