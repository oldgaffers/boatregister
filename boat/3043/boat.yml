full_description: "<p>The original &lsquo;Diamond&rsquo; was built in 1897 by Sibbick

  jubilee, hence the name, and subsequently sold to a Russian Count who sailed her
  in the Mediterranean and then in Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known as &lsquo;skimming
  dishes&rsquo; this style of fin and bulb keel rater was very popular and built to
  similar designs up to about 65&rsquo;. They were very fast light displacement boats
  only suitable for racing with no accommodation and effectively outlawed by 1901.</p>\r
