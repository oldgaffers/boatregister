full_description: "<p>The original &lsquo;Diamond&rsquo; was built in 1897 by Sibbick\

  \ jubilee, hence the name, and subsequently sold to a Russian Count who sailed her\
  \ in the Mediterranean and then in Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known as &lsquo;skimming\
  \ dishes&rsquo; this style of fin and bulb keel rater was very popular and built\
  \ to similar designs up to about 65&rsquo;. They were very fast light displacement\
  \ boats only suitable for racing with no accommodation and effectively outlawed\
  \ by 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After she was sold in 2019 her new owner took her to Palma,\
  \ Majorca.</p>"
