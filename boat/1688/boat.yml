    Reluctantly selling much loved Isabella, an excellent family gaffer with a deep
    roomy cockpit for 4 â€“ 6 adults or a sizeable family with children. She is built
    to a high specification of marine plywood with mahogany gunwales and laid teak
    decks fore and aft. Lovingly restored over the past few years with professional
    finishing by Gweek Classic Boatyard, she now needs a new owner to take her back
    on the water.


    She comes with traditional tan sails (foresail on bowsprit, main, mizzen and
    topsail) and some 140kg of bagged lead ballast for trimming. All spars are in
    good condition and would benefit from a coat of varnish. The outboard engine
    needs servicing.


    She has a galvanised steel centre plate/drop keel with winch in good condition.
    With the plate up, she will take the ground safely.


    Included is a road trailer with ball hitch, winch, spare wheel and jack.
