  sales_text: '<p>&ldquo;Thetis&rdquo; is a Saltern&rsquo;s Tela 16&rsquo; 6&rdquo;
    dayboat that was built in 2004. Telas were built from a mould that<br /> was taken
    from a Barry Island &ldquo;seeker&rdquo; (i.e., a small pilot boat). &ldquo;Thetis&rdquo;
    has a pale blue grp hull with<br /> cream decks, oiled hardwood fit out with bronze
    thole pins and rowlocks, and varnished spars, all of<br /> which are in good condition.
    The gaff main and furling jib were new in 2019 and have been lightly<br /> used.
    Topsail and yard. The standing and running rigging are in good condition. Pair
    of leathered<br /> wooden oars. Bilge pump. Tiller extension. Padded rudder bag.
    There are two covers: one over the<br /> boom for &ldquo;in-use&rdquo; and a &ldquo;flat&rdquo;
    one for towing and storage ashore. Robust Hayling road trailer (new<br /> wheel
    bearings 2022) with spare wheel.<br /> Telas are known to be very well-balanced
    sailing boats and &ldquo;Thetis&rdquo; is a delight to sail having won<br /> her
    class at several OGA events.<br /> Priced to sell at &pound;6,500, with an ePropulsion
    &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; electric outboard motor available separately for<br /> &pound;1,000.</p>'
