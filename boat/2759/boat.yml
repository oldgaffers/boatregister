  sales_text: "“Thetis” is a Saltern’s Tela 16’ 6” dayboat that was built in 2004.
    Telas were\nbuilt from a mould that    was taken from a Barry Island “seeker”
    (i.e., a small\npilot boat). “Thetis” has a pale blue grp hull with    cream decks,
    oiled\nhardwood fit out with bronze thole pins and rowlocks, and varnished spars,
    all\nof    which are in good condition. The gaff main and furling jib were new
    in\n2019 and have been lightly    used. Topsail and yard. The standing and running\n
    rigging are in good condition. Pair of leathered    wooden oars. Bilge pump.\n
    Tiller extension. Padded rudder bag. There are two covers: one over the    boom\n
    for “in-use” and a “flat” one for towing and storage ashore. Robust Hayling road\n
    trailer (new    wheel bearings 2022) with spare wheel.    Telas are known to be\n
    very well-balanced sailing boats and “Thetis” is a delight to sail having won\n
    her class at several OGA events.    Priced to sell at £6,500, with an\nePropulsion
    “Spirit” electric outboard motor available separately for    £1,000.\n\n"
