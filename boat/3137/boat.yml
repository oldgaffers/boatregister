  Built for leisure, 'Valiant' was fished 1939-1998 by the Freemantel family out
  of Portsmouth. She sank after a collision at Spithead in 1998. Recovered,
  restored re-engined and re-masted during 1999 - 2006 by Frank Worley, she was
  moved to Brittany, France. In 2017, she returned to the Solent.
full_description: |-
  *Valiant*, P189, was built Osborne's Littlehampton in 1937 for leisure with
  engine and auxilliary sails as an 3/4 open boat with focs'le and fore deck.


  She fished from Langstone Harbour and Portsmouth Camber from 1939 to 1998, owned
  by the Fremantle family. She was in collision with a large catarmaran whilst net
  fishing in July 1998 in the Solent, near Mary Rose wreck site, and sank.


  The charter skipper of the catarmaran was prosecuted for failing to keep a
  proper or any lookout. QHM obtained funds by distraint from the catarmaran's
  insurers in order to lift *Valiant* from the seabed. Having been recovered, her
  ownership changed, and the new owner put her ashore on the Common Hard, Portsea
  (not far from HMS Warrior).


  Frank Worley bought her in that condition, March 1999 and took her to Wicor
  Marine, Portchester whislt rebuilding her. Her portside planking was stove in
  amidships down to the waterline and 30 of her 50 portside frames were broken.
  Eight of her 18 planks were renewed along with all her frames.


  In order to stiffen her, new engine bearers were installed by boatbuilders, long
  enough to support the fuel tank aft of the new Beta 37hp engine and PRM gearbox
  and the mast step forward. Two bulkheads were installed and she was partially
  decked. Technically, she is still an open boat, the deck has a canvas cover over
  the 'hold' carlins. Two bunks were built in soft wood and ply and a third person
  can be accomodated overnight on foam bunk cushions.


  The mast at 28ft is constructed from a telegraph pole casually cast aside in a
  friends garden by BT in pursuit of new EU regs. It has been slimmed down to
  suit. The bowsprit, 15ft, is the old mast and is hinged on the mast partners to
  reduce LoS.


  Sails were made from Kayospruce tan 7.2oz Clipper Canvas.  The loose footed gaff
  main (to avoid brain damage to crew) is approx 200sq. ft with two reefs down to
  approx 100sq. ft. The forestay has either a small jib approx 65sq. ft, or a cut
  down genoa of approx 80sq. ft. A forestaysail of cream 7.2oz Clipper Canvas is
  approx 80sq. ft.


  Legs bolted through the hull sides to longditudinal members enable drying out
  upright and ashore over winter.


  Sadly *Valiant* sank on her mooring in August 2023, and was declared
  unrepairable.
