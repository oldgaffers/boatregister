full_description: "<p>&#39;Valiant&#39;, P189, was built Osborne&#39;s Littlehampton\
  \ in 1937 for leisure with engine and auxilliary sails&nbsp;as an 3/4 open boat\
  \ with focs&#39;le and fore deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She fished from Langstone Harbour\
  \ and Portsmouth Camber from 1939 to 1998, owned by the Fremantle family. She was\
  \ in collision with a large catarmaran whilst net fishing in July 1998 in the Solent,\
  \ near Mary Rose wreck site, and sank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charter skipper of the\
  \ catarmaran was prosecuted for failing to keep a proper or any lookout. QHM obtained\
  \ funds by distraint from the catarmaran&#39;s insurers in order to lift &#39;Valiant&#39;\
  \ from the seabed. Having been recovered, her ownership changed, and the new owner\
  \ put her ashore on the Common Hard, Portsea (not far from HMS Warrior).</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>Frank Worley bought her in that condition, March 1999 and took her to Wicor\
  \ Marine, Portchester whislt rebuilding her. Her portside planking was stove in\
  \ amidships down to the waterline and 30 of her 50 portside frames were broken.\
  \ Eight of her 18 planks were renewed along with all her frames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ order&nbsp;to stiffen her, new engine bearers were installed by boatbuilders,\
  \ long enough to support the fuel tank aft of the new Beta 37hp engine and PRM gearbox\
  \ and the mast step forward. Two bulkheads were installed and she was partially\
  \ decked. Technically, she is still an open boat, the deck has a canvas cover over\
  \ the &#39;hold&#39; carlins. Two bunks were built in soft wood and ply and a third\
  \ person can be accomodated overnight on foam bunk cushions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mast\
  \ at 28ft&nbsp;is constructed from a telegraph pole casually cast aside in a friends\
  \ garden by BT in pursuit of new EU regs. It has been slimmed down to suit. The\
  \ bowsprit, 15ft, is the old mast and is hinged on the mast partners to reduce LoS.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Sails were made from Kayospruce tan 7.2oz Clipper Canvas. &nbsp;The loose\
  \ footed gaff main (to avoid brain damage to crew) is approx&nbsp;200sq. ft with\
  \ two reefs down to approx 100sq. ft. The forestay has either a small jib approx&nbsp;65sq.\
  \ ft, or a cut down genoa of approx 80sq. ft. A forestaysail of cream 7.2oz Clipper\
  \ Canvas is approx 80sq. ft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legs bolted through the hull sides to\
  \ longditudinal members enable drying out upright and ashore over winter.</p>"
