  Hull 17 was built in 1995 by Roger Wilkinson for Alastair Dickenson, the silver
  expert on the Antiques Roadshow.


  She has been cruised in the Lake District and on the Solent for the past 20
  years with no name.


  Her current owner bought her in 2021 and set about naming her, replacing all of
  the running rigging, re-caulking the deck, coppercoating the hull, repainting
  the transom and re-varnishing all of the spars.


  He wasnt looking at buying a boat but couldnt resist her mahogany interior and
  Davey bronze fittings.


  'Selene' will be present a many OGA events and raced throughout the Solent.
