full_description: '<p>Hull 17 was built in 1995 by Roger Wilkinson for Alastair Dickenson,
  the silver expert on the Antiques Roadshow.</p>

  <p>She has been cruised in the Lake District and on the Solent for the past 20 years
  with no name.</p>

  <p>Her current owner bought her in 2021 and set about naming her, replacing all
  of the running rigging, re-caulking the deck, coppercoating the hull, repainting
  the transom and re-varnishing all of the spars.</p>

  <p>He wasnt looking at buying a boat but couldnt resist her mahogany interior and
  Davey bronze fittings.</p>

  <p>''Selene'' will be present a many OGA events and raced throughout the Solent.</p>'
