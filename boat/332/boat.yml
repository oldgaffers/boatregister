short_description: Gwenili is a very well known gaffer on the East Coast of England,
  having spent the last 50 years in the Area. She has been well maintained over that
  time and is a regular participant in racing and cruising events. In 2019, she was
  sold and taken to Thessaloniki, Greece.

  <p>Martin Goodrich, owner 2004 - 2019, reports on his research.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r
  \n<p>I bought Gwenili in September 2004 from Graham Bushell who had her for two
  years. He is a Harbour Master at Woolverstone Marina on the river Orwell near Ipswich.
  He acquired her from Brian Humby who bought her in 1955 when she was laid up in
  a mud birth at Bucklers Hard. The process of buying her and sailing her to the Orwell
  was part of his honeymoon. Brian was a teacher in Ipswich. He was her custodian
  for some for 47 years and kept her at Pin Mill where he was a member of the Pin
  Mill Sailing Club. There is a good painting of Gwenili in the club house and her
  name is inscribed on Club cups. Brian and the boat were well know sailing characters
  in these waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially a cruising vessel, Brian kept her sailing
  with his young family as he made trips around the East Anglian coast, Dutch waters,
  the Channel Isles, the Scillies and the Western Isles. He looked after her very
  well and kept her sailing every year except 1971 when he undertook major work replacing
  the rusted away steel strap floors with heavy oak floors which stopped her leaking.</p>\r
  \n\r\n<p>In 1984 her worn out Thornycroft 2cyl Handy Billy was replaced by a 38hp
  BMC diesel. Brian and his wife was sailing her well into his 80s. Brian had no information
  of the previous owner, I did meet up with his son who sailed with his father and
  is the chief Harbour Master at Wooverstone Marina who said the owner was in the
  RAF and the boat might have formally been called &#39;Piros&#39;. In his time Brian
  changed the sails to tan and spars were painted with white tips to give her the
  appearance of a working boat on the east coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Feb 2007 I participated
  in the Frost Bite race on the river Thames and a photo appeared in Classic Boat
  of Gwenili. I was then contacted via the editor by Michael Godley who thought he
  recognised the photo of Gwenili as a boat he crewed on in the summer of 1939 when
  he was 14. By exchange of photos we established it was the same vessel. He informed
  me that she was owned by Michael Fellowes who was in his early twenties. He had
  met them at Belsay Castle in Northumberland as a guest of Mrs Middleton. So in the
  summer of 1939 while sailing in Britany they had to return in a hurry as war had
  been declared and they rushed to join up, Michael and Michael Fellows both joined
  the RAF. The owner&#39;s father was Air Commodore Fellowes who in 1933 led the first
  successful flight over Everest. Michael also wrote a log and took photos of his
  sailing holiday to Brittany which I have copies of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent times
  I have been sailing on the UK East Coast participating In OGA rally events, Holland
  and North France. I have maintained a programme of restoration to keep her up to
  scratch. In 2007 I improved her sail area and fitted new sails which has made a
  considerable improvement to her sailing performance and handling as well as improving
  her deck and gunwale. I have also made every effort to return her appearance to
  a cruising yacht with her rather fine and elegant lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has undergone
  fairly major works at St Osyth Boatyard working with Shipwright Alan Williams including
  new stem, starboard garboard and strake above, new rudder and propeller, re-caulking
  and re-fastening where required and new engine sump,diesel and water tanks.</p>\r
  \n\r\n<p>In March 2011 I replaced the old BBC 1500 Engine with its attendant oil
  leaks for a 37hp Nannie/ Kabuto Engine. Half the physical size with twice the power,
  this has been a considerable success increased my cruising range by 50/50 sailing.
  Also the reduction of the engine size in the doghouse and has inspired me to consider
  increasing the size of the cockpit creating more room, comfort and all round vision
  when sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the winter of 2012 at St Osyth Boat Yard we undertook
  extensive maintenance work including two thirds re-caulking, replaced half plank
  below waterline on port side, planking repair on starboard side above waterline.
  We also refastened hood ends at the stern, refastened and re-galvanized all chain
  plates, repainted four coats all round and made repairs to cabin beams and coamings.
  Finally we fitted a new doghouse and cockpit, re-paying all deck seams.</p>\r\n\r
  \n<p>I have found out more about her early French history and when she first came
  under the British Flag and I have a log and photos by Michael Godley at Carantec
  Brittany August 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer 2012 I sailed to the west coast
  of France, including Brest and Douarnenez Festival, then down to Bordeaux via La
  Rochelle. Gwenili over-wintered in La Rochelle as I unfortunately contracted cancer.</p>\r
  \n\r\n<p>In 2013, having recovered from my illness, I sailed her back to Brightlingsea
  in August via Cowes and the OGA50 celebrations. In 2014, I sailed Gwenili to the
  Netherlands to take part in the Dutch Anniversary Tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015 Gwenili
  returned to France, in company with several other OGA members from the Netherlands
  and UK to celebrate in St Malo with the Vieux Greements de France. Following on
  from this, we took part in the Branlebas Regatta. As well as the Groupe Giboire
  trophy for 2<sup>nd</sup> place, Gwenili received a special award:&nbsp;Troph&eacute;e
  Raymond Labb&eacute;&nbsp; in recognition of her overall performance, classic lines
  and restoration. Martin Goodrich went to France to receive his award on 2 December
  2015.</p>\r\n</blockquote>"
