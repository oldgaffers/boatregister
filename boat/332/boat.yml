  having spent the last 50 years in the Area. She has been well maintained over that

  <p>Martin Goodrich, owner 2004 - 2019, reports on his research.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\
  \n<p>I bought Gwenili in September 2004 from Graham Bushell who had her for two\
  \ years. He is a Harbour Master at Woolverstone Marina on the river Orwell near\
  \ Ipswich. He acquired her from Brian Humby who bought her in 1955 when she was\
  \ laid up in a mud birth at Bucklers Hard. The process of buying her and sailing\
  \ her to the Orwell was part of his honeymoon. Brian was a teacher in Ipswich. He\
  \ was her custodian for some for 47 years and kept her at Pin Mill where he was\
  \ a member of the Pin Mill Sailing Club. There is a good painting of Gwenili in\
  \ the club house and her name is inscribed on Club cups. Brian and the boat were\
  \ well know sailing characters in these waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially a cruising\
  \ vessel, Brian kept her sailing with his young family as he made trips around the\
  \ East Anglian coast, Dutch waters, the Channel Isles, the Scillies and the Western\
  \ Isles. He looked after her very well and kept her sailing every year except 1971\
  \ when he undertook major work replacing the rusted away steel strap floors with\
  \ heavy oak floors which stopped her leaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1984 her worn out\
  \ Thornycroft 2cyl Handy Billy was replaced by a 38hp BMC diesel. Brian and his\
  \ wife was sailing her well into his 80s. Brian had no information of the previous\
  \ owner, I did meet up with his son who sailed with his father and is the chief\
  \ Harbour Master at Wooverstone Marina who said the owner was in the RAF and the\
  \ boat might have formally been called &#39;Piros&#39;. In his time Brian changed\
  \ the sails to tan and spars were painted with white tips to give her the appearance\
  \ of a working boat on the east coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Feb 2007 I participated\
  \ in the Frost Bite race on the river Thames and a photo appeared in Classic Boat\
  \ of Gwenili. I was then contacted via the editor by Michael Godley who thought\
  \ he recognised the photo of Gwenili as a boat he crewed on in the summer of 1939\
  \ when he was 14. By exchange of photos we established it was the same vessel. He\
  \ informed me that she was owned by Michael Fellowes who was in his early twenties.\
  \ He had met them at Belsay Castle in Northumberland as a guest of Mrs Middleton.\
  \ So in the summer of 1939 while sailing in Britany they had to return in a hurry\
  \ as war had been declared and they rushed to join up, Michael and Michael Fellows\
  \ both joined the RAF. The owner&#39;s father was Air Commodore Fellowes who in\
  \ 1933 led the first successful flight over Everest. Michael also wrote a log and\
  \ took photos of his sailing holiday to Brittany which I have copies of.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>In recent times I have been sailing on the UK East Coast participating In\
  \ OGA rally events, Holland and North France. I have maintained a programme of restoration\
  \ to keep her up to scratch. In 2007 I improved her sail area and fitted new sails\
  \ which has made a considerable improvement to her sailing performance and handling\
  \ as well as improving her deck and gunwale. I have also made every effort to return\
  \ her appearance to a cruising yacht with her rather fine and elegant lines.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She has undergone fairly major works at St Osyth Boatyard working with\
  \ Shipwright Alan Williams including new stem, starboard garboard and strake above,\
  \ new rudder and propeller, re-caulking and re-fastening where required and new\
  \ engine sump,diesel and water tanks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2011 I replaced the\
  \ old BBC 1500 Engine with its attendant oil leaks for a 37hp Nannie/ Kabuto Engine.\
  \ Half the physical size with twice the power, this has been a considerable success\
  \ increased my cruising range by 50/50 sailing. Also the reduction of the engine\
  \ size in the doghouse and has inspired me to consider increasing the size of the\
  \ cockpit creating more room, comfort and all round vision when sailing.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>In the winter of 2012 at St Osyth Boat Yard we undertook extensive maintenance\
  \ work including two thirds re-caulking, replaced half plank below waterline on\
  \ port side, planking repair on starboard side above waterline. We also refastened\
  \ hood ends at the stern, refastened and re-galvanized all chain plates, repainted\
  \ four coats all round and made repairs to cabin beams and coamings. Finally we\
  \ fitted a new doghouse and cockpit, re-paying all deck seams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have\
  \ found out more about her early French history and when she first came under the\
  \ British Flag and I have a log and photos by Michael Godley at Carantec Brittany\
  \ August 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer 2012 I sailed to the west coast of France,\
  \ including Brest and Douarnenez Festival, then down to Bordeaux via La Rochelle.\
  \ Gwenili over-wintered in La Rochelle as I unfortunately contracted cancer.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 2013, having recovered from my illness, I sailed her back to Brightlingsea\
  \ in August via Cowes and the OGA50 celebrations. In 2014, I sailed Gwenili to the\
  \ Netherlands to take part in the Dutch Anniversary Tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015\
  \ Gwenili returned to France, in company with several other OGA members from the\
  \ Netherlands and UK to celebrate in St Malo with the Vieux Greements de France.\
  \ Following on from this, we took part in the Branlebas Regatta. As well as the\
  \ Groupe Giboire trophy for 2<sup>nd</sup> place, Gwenili received a special award:&nbsp;Troph&eacute;e\
  \ Raymond Labb&eacute;&nbsp; in recognition of her overall performance, classic\
  \ lines and restoration. Martin Goodrich went to France to receive his award on\
  \ 2 December 2015.</p>\r\n</blockquote>"
