short_description: A modern interpretation of a 1920s Mevagissy Tosher.
full_description: |-
  Molly Cobbler's lines were drawn by naval architecht Paul Fisher as a result of
  a commission to produce an open gaff cutter based on a traditional Mevagissey
  Tosher fishing boat, but with a lifting keel and modern construction. The lines
  are very similar to those of a 1926 Tosher in the National maritime museum
  archive.


  Paul Fisher's plans were modified by the owner to include a cabin and cruising
  accommodation for two. Building commenced in 1997 at Fabian Bush's yard in
  Rowhedge and Molly was launched at Downs Road, Maldon in April 2000.

    All good things come to an end, and it is evident to me that my single-handed
    sailing days are now limited. *Molly Cobbler* has carried me (almost) the length
    and breadth of the British Isles (from the Netherlands to Bantry Bay, from Mull
    to the Isle of Wight) and given me so much joy, but the time has come to look
    for her new custodian.Â 


    *Molly Cobbler* is a 19 foot gaff cutter, launched in 2000. Her hull was built
    by Fabian Bush according to a design by Paul Fisher, based on a Mevagissey
    Tosher, and everything else was fitted out by her first owner, Bernard Patrick.
    So *Molly* is unique! Her hull is epoxy-glued clinker plywood over laminated ash
    frames. There are two full-length bunks (a spare for a temporary crew, or to
    keep a folding bike on!) as well as a 5hp Mercury outboard and a two burner and
    grill gas cooker. She has mainsail, staysail, jib and asymmetric sails plus
    cockpit cover, sail cover, boom tent and all-over cover (for use ashore), also
    boatyard trailer. She has been very well maintained. She is a brilliant boat for
    single-handed sailing, very comfortable and great fun. She slips along in
    imperceptibly light airs on flat water, but keeps me well protected if we find
    ourselves out in a Force 6. I hope her next custodian is reading this! I am
    planning to sail at Milford Haven with the Round Britain boats in May, then to
    take her up the Bristol Channel, motor across country along the Kennet and Avon
    canal and down the Thames, then come round the coast to Ipswich for the
    celebrations at the end of the RBC60 in August. Anyone who thinks *Molly* might
    be the boat they are looking for is welcome to arrange to come to see and sail
    on her during this season, and I will be ready to bid her a fond farewell come
    autumn.
