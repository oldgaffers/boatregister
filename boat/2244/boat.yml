short_description: A modern interpretation of a 1920s Mevagissy Tosher.
full_description: "<p>Molly Cobbler&#39;s lines were drawn by naval architecht Paul\
  \ Fisher as a result of a commission to produce an open gaff cutter based on a traditional\
  \ Mevagissey Tosher fishing boat, but with a lifting keel and modern construction.\
  \ The lines are very similar to those of a 1926 Tosher in the National maritime\
  \ museum archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Fisher&#39;s plans were modified by the owner\
  \ to include a cabin and cruising accommodation for two. Building commenced in 1997\
  \ at Fabian Bush&#39;s yard in Rowhedge and Molly was launched at Downs Road, Maldon\
  \ in April 2000.</p>"
