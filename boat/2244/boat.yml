  A modern interpretation of a 1920s Mevagissy Tosher.

full_description: |+
  Molly Cobbler's lines were drawn by naval architecht Paul Fisher as a result of
  a commission to produce an open gaff cutter based on a traditional Mevagissey
  Tosher fishing boat, but with a lifting keel and modern construction. The lines
  are very similar to those of a 1926 Tosher in the National maritime museum
  archive.


  Paul Fisher's plans were modified by the owner to include a cabin and cruising
  accommodation for two. Building commenced in 1997 at Fabian Bush's yard in
  Rowhedge and Molly was launched at Downs Road, Maldon in April 2000.

  sales_text: "All good things come to an end, and it is evident to me that my single-handed\n\
    sailing days are now limited. *Molly Cobbler* has carried me (almost) the length\n\
    and breadth of the British Isles (from the Netherlands to Bantry Bay, from Mull\n\
    to the Isle of Wight) and given me so much joy, but the time has come to look\n\
    for her new custodian.\_\n\n*Molly Cobbler* is a 19 foot gaff cutter, launched\
    \ in 2000. Her hull was built\nby Fabian Bush according to a design by Paul Fisher,\
    \ based on a Mevagissey\nTosher, and everything else was fitted out by her first\
    \ owner, Bernard Patrick.\nSo *Molly* is unique! Her hull is epoxy-glued clinker\
    \ plywood over laminated ash\nframes. There are two full-length bunks (a spare\
    \ for a temporary crew, or to\nkeep a folding bike on!) as well as a 5hp Mercury\
    \ outboard and a two burner and\ngrill gas cooker. She has mainsail, staysail,\
    \ jib and asymmetric sails plus\ncockpit cover, sail cover, boom tent and all-over\
    \ cover (for use ashore), also\nboatyard trailer. She has been very well maintained.\
    \ She is a brilliant boat for\nsingle-handed sailing, very comfortable and great\
    \ fun. She slips along in\nimperceptibly light airs on flat water, but keeps me\
    \ well protected if we find\nourselves out in a Force 6. I hope her next custodian\
    \ is reading this! I am\nplanning to sail at Milford Haven with the Round Britain\
    \ boats in May, then to\ntake her up the Bristol Channel, motor across country\
    \ along the Kennet and Avon\ncanal and down the Thames, then come round the coast\
    \ to Ipswich for the\ncelebrations at the end of the RBC60 in August. Anyone who\
    \ thinks *Molly* might\nbe the boat they are looking for is welcome to arrange\
    \ to come to see and sail\non her during this season, and I will be ready to bid\
    \ her a fond farewell come\nautumn.\n\n"
