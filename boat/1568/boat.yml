    \ out by\nRobertson\"s of Woodbridge. The interior design and build quality are\
    \ excellent\nand she\u2019s in good condition inside and out, a credit to her\
    \ builders and\nowners.\_\n\nA review by Classic Boat Magazine described her as\
    \ \"the nicest Heard 28 I\"ve\nseen\" [copy\_ available]. Equipped for offshore\_\
    cruising with modern navigation\naids:\_Raymarine C90 Plotter;\_VHF DSC/AIS;\_\
    \_Raymarine Bi Data Log/Depth. An\nInsurance Survey in 2019 found no major defects.\
    \ Rigging replaced 2016, engine\nrebuilt 2009.\_\n\nIn recent years she\"s taken\
    \ part in the Brest and Douarnenez Festivals, Falmouth\nClassics and Yarmouth\
    \ Old Gaffers.\_The present owner has downsized to a smaller\nGaffer.\n\n\"Molly\
