  sales_text: "A Heard 28, built in 1989, \"Molly Oxford\" was professionally fitted
    out by\nRobertson\"s of Woodbridge. The interior design and build quality are
    excellent\nand she’s in good condition inside and out, a credit to her builders
    and\nowners. \n\nA review by Classic Boat Magazine described her as \"the nicest
    Heard 28 I\"ve\nseen\" [copy  available]. Equipped for offshore cruising with
    modern navigation\naids: Raymarine C90 Plotter; VHF DSC/AIS;  Raymarine Bi Data
    Log/Depth. An\nInsurance Survey in 2019 found no major defects. Rigging replaced
    2016, engine\nrebuilt 2009. \n\nIn recent years she\"s taken part in the Brest
    and Douarnenez Festivals, Falmouth\nClassics and Yarmouth Old Gaffers. The present
    owner has downsized to a smaller\nGaffer.\n\n\"Molly Oxford\" is afloat and in
    commission at Chichester West Sussex, an\nopportunity for a new discerning skipper
    to continue her adventures.\n\n"
