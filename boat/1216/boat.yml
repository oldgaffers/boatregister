full_description: |-
  *Boojum* is a pitch pine on oak cutter and true classic to boot.

  She measures 46ft on deck (60ft over her impressive bowsprit) and was built by WE Thomas of Falmouth in 1909, who had a significant reputation for building Falmouth quay punts like *Cynara* and *Dorothea*.Originally built as a gentleman’s yacht, *Boojum’s* builder took the robust lines of a Bristol Channel pilot cutter but then married them with the elegance and performance required for a vessel designed for both speed and comfort. Fitted from new with a wheel rather than a tiller and an engine – highly unusual for the time – *Boojum* was a pioneer of sorts in blending tradition with innovation.

  Named after Lewis Carroll’s fictitious character in Hunting of the Snark, *Boojum* was commissioned by Buckley Haed.T W Bonnett of Basildon House, London was also one of her early owners followed in 1930 by J D MacGregor of Golder’s Green.

  H M Pinney of Hornchurch, Essex became the next registered owner keeping the vessel until 1955 when both B Farquharson and A Thompson of Devonshire Close, London took over ownership.

  In 1960 *Boojum* was sold to J K Hill of Hale, Cheshire, after which she was laid-up in the river at Caernarfon and in 1966 looked shabby.  
    
  At some point she was sold to Scotland, where she sailed out of Largs. In the early 1990s she spent 5 years uncovered on the hard there, after the death of her owner. Her decks leaked, and she deteriorated fast. While there she was recognised by Jonathon Morgan who had gone up her mast to retrieve a broken block as a child. This memory made him look to buy her when he was 18. Working on her daily, before and after going to his job and every weekend, he restored her to sailing condition within a year. He cruised her in the Clyde, and to Ireland, during his 10 years of ownership.  
  *Boojum* eventually returned to the West Country in 2012. Since then countless hours were dedicated to refitting the vessel and making her ready for family adventures. One of the first major jobs was restoring the cockpit – at some point in her long life, she had lost it altogether – and redoing all her frames and keel bolts, ensuring she was structurally sound and ready for decades to come.

  After cruising the West Country she took part in the 2021 Around The Island Race and Cowes Classic Week before sailing to Portugal for the 2025 season.
