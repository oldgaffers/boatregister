  *Boojum* is a true classic yacht, built on Bristol Chanel Pilot Cutter lines.
full_description:  |-
  *Boojum* is a pitch pine on oak cutter and true classic to boot.
  
  She measures 46ft on deck (60ft over her impressive bowsprit) and was built by
  WE Thomas of Falmouth in 1909, who had a significant reputation for building Falmouth
  quay punts like *Cynara* and *Dorothea*.Originally built as a gentleman’s yacht,
  *Boojum’s* builder took the robust lines of a Bristol Channel pilot cutter but
  then married them with the elegance and performance required for a vessel designed
  for both speed and comfort.
  Fitted from new with a wheel rather than a tiller and an engine – highly 
  unusual for the time – *Boojum* was a pioneer of sorts in blending
  tradition with innovation. 
  
  Named after Lewis Carroll’s fictitious character in Hunting of the Snark, *Boojum* 
  was commissioned by Buckley Haed.T W Bonnett of Basildon House, London was also 
  one of her early owners followed in 1930 by J D MacGregor of Golder’s Green.
  
  H M Pinney of Hornchurch, Essex became the next registered owner keeping the
  vessel until 1955 when both B Farquharson and A Thompson of Devonshire Close, 
  London took over ownership.
  
  In 1960 *Boojum* was sold to J K Hill of Hale, Cheshire, after which she was 
  laid-up in the river at Caernarfon and in 1966 looked shabby.
  
  Under Scottish ownership the vessel appears to have experienced mixed fortunes
  and eventually returned to the West Country in 2012.
  Since then countless hours were dedicated to refitting the vessel and making her
  ready for family adventures.
  One of the first major jobs was restoring the cockpit – at some point in her 
  long life, she had lost it altogether – and redoing all her frames and keel bolts, 
  ensuring she was structurally sound and ready for decades to come.
  
  After cruising the West Country she took part in the 2021 Around The Island
  Race and Cowes Classic Week before sailing to Portugal for the 2025 season.
