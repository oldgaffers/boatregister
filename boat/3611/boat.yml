  I bought Puffin in 2010. She's clearly an old boat and still has some original
  bronze fittings. Her previous owner told me that she was bullt by a carpenter in
  Liverpool. Her old, very leaky front buoyancy bag had a manufacturing date of
  1962 which probably gives a minimum age for her. She's clearly been re-decked at
  some point. At some point around the millenium her then owners decided to
  register her with the class association which is why she carries such a high
  sail number.
