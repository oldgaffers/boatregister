  *Iseult* was found by Rodney Wallace in a very sorry state in a mud berth in
  Combes Yard Bosham around 1970. It took about a year to get her back to a
  reasonable condition and she entered the Solent Old Gaffers race in 72 and 73.

  In 1974 she took part in the Heineken Rally from Stone club on the Blackwater
  which was a wonderful experience. After the event Rodney remained in Holland for
  several months eventually selling *Iseult* there.
