short_description: "'Wendy May' is the last of four sister ships, built in 1936, based
  on Maurice\nGriffiths' design 'Olive Mary'.\n\n"
full_description: "A typical East Coast gaff cutter yacht, *'Wendy May*' was the fourth
  to be built\nto a Maurice Griffiths design; the first three being built at Harry
  King's Yard\nat Pin Mill on the River Orwell, Suffolk.\n\n\n'*Wendy May*' has cruised
  extensively around the UK, France, Ireland and\nHolland. \n\n\nFrom about 1972 to
  1993 she was a much loved part of the Monro family, only\nbeing sold when Mrs Monro
  unexpectedly passed away. Under their ownership *Wendy\nMay*  joined the PLA clipper
  regatta in London, the Heineken rally in Amsterdam\nand was sailed from the Hamble
  to the Walton Backwater where she was moored for\nseveral years.  Then she went
  up to Findhorn where she overwintered every year\nbut had a summer mooring in Ardfern
  on the West coast.  She sailed round the\nwestern Isles for several years, including
  through both Corrievrekken and Little\nCorrievrekken. Neil Monro recalls storming
  round Ardnamurchan in a force 8,\nthree reefs down and 6 knots on the log and being
  able to happily cook lunch. .\n\n\n#### Video produced by [My Classic Boat](http://www.myclassicboat.com/Home/).\n\
  \n\n'Wendy May' is a 25ft 6ins gaff cutter, designed by Maurice Griffiths and built\n
  in 1936 at the Williams & Parkinson boatyard in Deganwy, North Wales. She is 8ft\n
  5ins on the beam, draws 4ft 3ins and with her Oregon pine bowsprit shipped is\n
  32ft long. She has a waterline length of 23ft and is constructed of pitch pine\n
  on oak, copper fastened with marine ply decks, epoxy sheathed and professionally\n
  laid in 2000.\n\n\nShe has a cast iron ballast keel and internal pigs of lead ballast.
  'Wendy May'\nwas fitted with a Vetus 206 twin-cylinder 15 HP diesel engine in 1999.
  Below she\nhas a sink with brass pump tap to port and a chart table to starboard,
  two\nsettee berths with sitting headroom and about 6ft headroom beneath a central\n
  butterfly hatch. The saloon is also fitted with a Taylors 079/KB heater.\nAmidships
  to port behind a bulkhead is the galley consisting of a Taylors 028\ntwo burner
  cooker. To starboard amidships is a head. In the focs’le are two\nfurther berths.\n
  \n\nThere is a 2010 survey which concludes: ‘Wendy May has been found to be a very\n
  good example of a yacht from the 1930s. The structure is in sound condition.\nWhere
  restoration or replacement has been carried out, the work has been to a\ngood standard.’\n\
  \n\n'Wendy May' has been sailed extensively to Brittany, round Britain and Ireland\n
  and across the North Sea to the Netherlands. She was described when launched as\n
  being ‘dry and well able to heave-to, with sitting headroom beneath wide\nside-decks
  and with bulwarks 9ins high. In short a hard-weather packet.’\n\n"
