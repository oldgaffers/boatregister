full_description: "<p>A typical East Coast gaff cutter yacht, &#39;Wendy May&#39;\
  \ was the fourth to be built to a Maurice Griffiths design; the first three being\
  \ built at Harry King&#39;s Yard at Pin Mill on the River Orwell, Suffolk.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>&#39;Wendy May&#39; has cruised extensively around the UK, France, Ireland\
  \ and Holland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\

  \n\r\n<h4>Video produced by <a href=\"http://www.myclassicboat.com/Home/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">My Classic Boat</a>.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Wendy May&#39; is a 25ft 6ins\
  \ gaff cutter, designed by Maurice Griffiths and built in 1936 at the Williams &amp;\
  \ Parkinson boatyard in Deganwy, North Wales. She is 8ft 5ins on the beam, draws\
  \ 4ft 3ins and with her Oregon pine bowsprit shipped is 32ft long. She has a waterline\
  \ length of 23ft and is constructed of pitch pine on oak, copper fastened with marine\
  \ ply decks, epoxy sheathed and professionally laid in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has\
  \ a cast iron ballast keel and internal pigs of lead ballast. &#39;Wendy May&#39;\
  \ was fitted with a Vetus 206 twin-cylinder 15 HP diesel engine in 1999. Below she\
  \ has a sink with brass pump tap to port and a chart table to starboard, two settee\
  \ berths with sitting headroom and about 6ft headroom beneath a central butterfly\
  \ hatch. The saloon is also fitted with a Taylors 079/KB heater. Amidships to port\
  \ behind a bulkhead is the galley consisting of a Taylors 028 two burner cooker.\
  \ To starboard amidships is a head. In the focs&rsquo;le are two further berths.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>There is a 2010 survey which concludes: &lsquo;Wendy May has been found\
  \ to be a very good example of a yacht from the 1930s. The structure is in sound\
  \ condition. Where restoration or replacement has been carried out, the work has\
  \ been to a good standard.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Wendy May&#39; has been sailed\
  \ extensively to Brittany, round Britain and Ireland and across the North Sea to\
  \ the Netherlands. She was described when launched as being &lsquo;dry and well\
  \ able to heave-to, with sitting headroom beneath wide side-decks and with bulwarks\
  \ 9ins high. In short a hard-weather packet.&rsquo;</p>"
