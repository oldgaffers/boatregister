  'Wendy May' is the last of four sister ships, built in 1936, based on Maurice
  Griffiths' design 'Olive Mary'.

full_description: |+
  A typical East Coast gaff cutter yacht, *'Wendy May*' was the fourth to be built
  to a Maurice Griffiths design; the first three being built at Harry King's Yard
  at Pin Mill on the River Orwell, Suffolk.


  '*Wendy May*' has cruised extensively around the UK, France, Ireland and
  Holland. 


  From about 1972 to 1993 she was a much loved part of the Monro family, only
  being sold when Mrs Monro unexpectedly passed away. Under their ownership *Wendy
  May*  joined the PLA clipper regatta in London, the Heineken rally in Amsterdam
  and was sailed from the Hamble to the Walton Backwater where she was moored for
  several years.  Then she went up to Findhorn where she overwintered every year
  but had a summer mooring in Ardfern on the West coast.  She sailed round the
  western Isles for several years, including through both Corrievrekken and Little
  Corrievrekken. Neil Monro recalls storming round Ardnamurchan in a force 8,
  three reefs down and 6 knots on the log and being able to happily cook lunch. .

  'Wendy May' is a 25ft 6ins gaff cutter, designed by Maurice Griffiths and built
  in 1936 at the Williams & Parkinson boatyard in Deganwy, North Wales. She is 8ft
  5ins on the beam, draws 4ft 3ins and with her Oregon pine bowsprit shipped is
  32ft long. She has a waterline length of 23ft and is constructed of pitch pine
  on oak, copper fastened with marine ply decks, epoxy sheathed and professionally
  laid in 2000.


  She has a cast iron ballast keel and internal pigs of lead ballast. 'Wendy May'
  was fitted with a Vetus 206 twin-cylinder 15 HP diesel engine in 1999. Below she
  has a sink with brass pump tap to port and a chart table to starboard, two
  settee berths with sitting headroom and about 6ft headroom beneath a central
  butterfly hatch. The saloon is also fitted with a Taylors 079/KB heater.
  Amidships to port behind a bulkhead is the galley consisting of a Taylors 028
  two burner cooker. To starboard amidships is a head. In the focs’le are two
  further berths.


  There is a 2010 survey which concludes: ‘Wendy May has been found to be a very
  good example of a yacht from the 1930s. The structure is in sound condition.
  Where restoration or replacement has been carried out, the work has been to a
  good standard.’


  'Wendy May' has been sailed extensively to Brittany, round Britain and Ireland
  and across the North Sea to the Netherlands. She was described when launched as
  being ‘dry and well able to heave-to, with sitting headroom beneath wide
  side-decks and with bulwarks 9ins high. In short a hard-weather packet.’
