full_description: "A typical East Coast gaff cutter yacht, *'Wendy May*' was the fourth\
  \ to be built\nto a Maurice Griffiths design; the first three being built at Harry\
  \ King's Yard\nat Pin Mill on the River Orwell, Suffolk.\n\n\n'*Wendy May*' has\
  \ cruised extensively around the UK, France, Ireland and\nHolland.\_\n\n\nFrom about\
  \ 1972 to 1993 she was a much loved part of the Monro family, only\nbeing sold when\
  \ Mrs Monro unexpectedly passed away. Under their ownership *Wendy\nMay* \_joined\
  \ the PLA clipper regatta in London, the Heineken rally in Amsterdam\nand was sailed\
  \ from the Hamble to the Walton Backwater where she was moored for\nseveral years.\_\
  \ Then she went up to Findhorn where she overwintered every year\nbut had a summer\
  \ mooring in Ardfern on the West coast.\_ She sailed round the\nwestern Isles for\
  \ several years, including through both Corrievrekken and Little\nCorrievrekken.\_\
  Neil Monro recalls storming round Ardnamurchan in a force 8,\nthree reefs down and\
  \ 6 knots on the log and being able to happily cook lunch.\_.\n\n\n#### Video produced\
  \ by [My Classic Boat](http://www.myclassicboat.com/Home/).\n\n\n'Wendy May' is\
  \ a 25ft 6ins gaff cutter, designed by Maurice Griffiths and built\nin 1936 at the\
  \ Williams & Parkinson boatyard in Deganwy, North Wales. She is 8ft\n5ins on the\
  \ beam, draws 4ft 3ins and with her Oregon pine bowsprit shipped is\n32ft long.\
  \ She has a waterline length of 23ft and is constructed of pitch pine\non oak, copper\
  \ fastened with marine ply decks, epoxy sheathed and professionally\nlaid in 2000.\n\
  \n\nShe has a cast iron ballast keel and internal pigs of lead ballast. 'Wendy May'\n\
  was fitted with a Vetus 206 twin-cylinder 15 HP diesel engine in 1999. Below she\n\
  has a sink with brass pump tap to port and a chart table to starboard, two\nsettee\
  \ berths with sitting headroom and about 6ft headroom beneath a central\nbutterfly\
  \ hatch. The saloon is also fitted with a Taylors 079/KB heater.\nAmidships to port\
  \ behind a bulkhead is the galley consisting of a Taylors 028\ntwo burner cooker.\
  \ To starboard amidships is a head. In the focs\u2019le are two\nfurther berths.\n\
  \n\nThere is a 2010 survey which concludes: \u2018Wendy May has been found to be\
  \ a very\ngood example of a yacht from the 1930s. The structure is in sound condition.\n\
  Where restoration or replacement has been carried out, the work has been to a\n\
  good standard.\u2019\n\n\n'Wendy May' has been sailed extensively to Brittany, round\
  \ Britain and Ireland\nand across the North Sea to the Netherlands. She was described\
  \ when launched as\nbeing \u2018dry and well able to heave-to, with sitting headroom\
  \ beneath wide\nside-decks and with bulwarks 9ins high. In short a hard-weather\
  \ packet.\u2019\n\n"
