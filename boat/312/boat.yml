short_description: |-
  Fanny of Cowes is a well-known member of the OGA's East Coast sailing fleet,
  still sailing under her original fishing number from 1872. She has a long and
  interesting history. She's one of only four boats to take part in the first and
  50th Anniversary OGA East Coast races and has raced successfully at Cowes since
  the 1960s.
full_description: |-
  Built as a copy of Star, the champion Itchen Ferry in the 1860's, but Fanny was
  12" longer. Built on the erstwhile site of Ratsey and Lapthorns, Isle of Wight,
  the famous yacht Dolly Varden has the same underwater lines as Star and Fanny.


  Fanny was built in 1872 for the Paskins family, Cowes fish merchants, and owners
  of Star, and sold to the owners of Star in 1920. Sha had various owners to 1938,
  and lay neglected on the beach to 1946, when she was overhauled, given a new
  transom, new rigging and sails. At this time, a P model T Ford engine was
  fitted. Laid up in 1948 for ten months, she was then sold for Â£70. A Coventry
  Victor engine was fitted in 1958.


  Fanny was bought by David Cook of Ipswich in 1959, and sold in 1972.


  Fanny has always had a successful racing record, and was particularly keenly
  raced by Mr. Cooke, making very regular appearances in the East Coast Old
  Gaffers races. Her longevity is partly due to the fact that every piece of
  timber on her was thoroughly soaked in linseed oil by the first owner.


  She took part in the OGA Jubilee Festival at Cowes in 2013. Find out more about
  her on 'Sailing by' and listen to an interview with her skipper on [BBC Radio
  Solent](http://www.sailing-by.org.uk/fanny-of-cowes-built-1872-still-winning-trophies/).
