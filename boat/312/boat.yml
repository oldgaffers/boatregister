short_description: Fanny of Cowes is a well-known member of the OGA's East Coast sailing
  fleet, still sailing under her original fishing number from 1872. She has a long
  and interesting history. She's one of only four boats to take part in the first
  and 50th Anniversary OGA East Coast races and has raced successfully at Cowes since
  the 1960s.
full_description: "<p>Built as a copy of Star, the champion Itchen Ferry in the 1860&#39;s,\
  \ but Fanny was 12&quot; longer. Built on the erstwhile site of Ratsey and Lapthorns,\
  \ Isle of Wight, the famous yacht Dolly Varden has the same underwater lines as\
  \ Star and Fanny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fanny was built in 1872 for the Paskins family,\
  \ Cowes fish merchants, and owners of Star, and sold to the owners of Star in 1920.\
  \ Sha had various owners to 1938, and lay neglected on the beach to 1946, when she\
  \ was overhauled, given a new transom, new rigging and sails. At this time, a P\
  \ model T Ford engine was fitted. Laid up in 1948 for ten months, she was then sold\
  \ for &pound;70. A Coventry Victor engine was fitted in 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fanny\
  \ was bought by David Cook of Ipswich in 1959, and sold in 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fanny\
  \ has always had a successful racing record, and was particularly keenly raced by\
  \ Mr. Cooke, making very regular appearances in the East Coast Old Gaffers races.\
  \ Her longevity is partly due to the fact that every piece of timber on her was\
  \ thoroughly soaked in linseed oil by the first owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She took part\
  \ in the OGA Jubilee Festival at Cowes in 2013. Find out more about her on &#39;Sailing\
