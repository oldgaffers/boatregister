    *Vixen* is an Edwardian Gentlemanâ€™s/Lady's yacht. Built in 1914-15 in Lukes yard
    in Hamble. She has a handy Vire 7hp inboard engine (2 stroke) with electric
    start. She has her own cradle and is currently in Lymington out of the water in
    Haven key.   She was restored about 5 years ago and sadly little used since due
    to her owners ill health. She is in good condition but needs the usual TLC a
    wooden yacht requires.   Please get in touch to discus more.
