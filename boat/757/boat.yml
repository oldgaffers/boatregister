full_description: |-
  *Caliph* was built at Frazerburgh, date unknown but a guess has been made by her
  owner to be around 1905, and originally called *Maggie*. It is believed that
  she lay semi-derilict towards the end of World War 11. She was then sold to a
  Shetland owner, and first registered in Lerwick in 1948. She was sold in 1970,
  and then re-sold to her present owner. Extensively re-built and re-rigged as
  closely as possible to her original state as a Zulu Skiff. P. F. Arsons book,
  "Fishing, Boats and Fishing folk on the East Coast of Scotland" published about
  1932 has an ilustration entitled , "An old lute Skiff at Burghead, *Maggie*". It
  is believed that this is the boat in its original form.
