full_description: Caliph was built at Frazerburgh, date unknown but a guess has been
  made by her owner to be around 1905, and originally cared ' Maggie' . It is believed
  that she lay semi-derilict towards the and of World War 11. She was then sold to
  a Shetland owner, and first registered in Lerwick in 1948. She u was sold in 1970,
  and then re-sold to her present owner. Extensively re-built and re-rigged as closely
  as possible to her original state as a Zulu Skiff. P. F. Arsons book, "Fishing,
  Boats and Fishing folk on the East Coast of Sootland published about 1932 has an
  ilustration entitled , "An old lute Skiff at Burghead, Maggie". it is believed that
  this is the boat in its original form.
