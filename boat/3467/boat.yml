full_description: "The popular 9' Nesting Clinker Stem Dinghy is reminiscent of traditional\
  \ ships\u2019 tenders, built to carry heavy loads of people and stores.<p>She is\
  \ quite chubby and has more freeboard (depth) than most designs of this size, but\
  \ still performs well under sail, oars or motor.<p>Being a Nestaway she splits into\
  \ two sections, and the bow fits inside the stern, for easier transport and storage:\
  \ on the deck of a yacht for example, (or on a vehicle towbar-mount carrying platform)<p>She\
  \ takes three adults rowing or motoring, and two for sailing. These are quite conservative\
  \ ratings, dictated by current regulations about the amount of buoyancy built in\
  \ rather than actual hull volume (20 years ago she would probably have sold as a\
  \ four-adult rowing boat).<p>She has a full length keel and deep skeg (an extra\
  \ bit of keel at the stern), which, combined with the long waterline, means she\
  \ tracks beautifully under oars. She carries her way through a fair chop and doesn\u2019\
  t get blown off course in the first gust; if you have only ever tried rowing an\
  \ inflatable, you will find this almost incomparably better! Oars included.<p>This\
  \ one is the high-spec version with navy blue \u201Csheer strake\u201D (top two\
  \ planks), cream interior, teak decking on the buoyancy tanks, rubber fendering\
  \ and sailing rig.<p>As Watercraft magazine found, probably the most comfortable\
  \ place to sit is on the floor, but you could also sit higher, on the centre thwart,\
  \ or the seat that spans the stern tanks.<p>The hull shape makes her highly resistant\
  \ to heeling for a 9' dinghy; she inspires confidence and (whilst not a racing machine)\
  \ is very enjoyable to sail. If you have read the books by Arthur Ransome, she is\
  \ often referred to as a miniature \u201CSwallow\u201D."
