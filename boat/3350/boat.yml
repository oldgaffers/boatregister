short_description: <p>&#39;Flycatcher&#39; is a dayboat, based on the catboats of
  New England whose original purpose was inshore fishing.&nbsp;She is designed to
  suit the shallow and sheltered waters of Chichester Harbour.</p>
full_description: "<p>James Stock, first owner and co-designer, was influenced in\
  \ his design of <em>Flycatcher </em>having sailed his cousin&#39;s Beetle Cat, <em>Breezy</em>,&nbsp;in\
  \ Nantucket Island,&nbsp;USA. This design&nbsp;first appeared in 1921 and today\
  \ Beetle Cats are ubiquitous in New England, along with many other designs of catboat.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She is designed to suit the waters of Chichester Harbour, hopefully improving\
  \ on the original Cape Cod classics with some modern materials, optimum&nbsp;hull\
  \ shape, fitting of a kicker and better performing foils;&nbsp;but maintaining the\
  \ traditional&nbsp;look&nbsp;- exemplified by Sitka and Douglas spars, ample varnished\
  \ teak trim and a beautifully cut cream sail. Excellent form stability, large cockpit\
  \ and simple rig, makes this dayboat&nbsp;ideal for singlehanded sailing or&nbsp;for\
  \ taking the family to the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James researched his design by visits\
  \ to museums in New England, observations of designs past and present, studying\
  \ the many books on the type&nbsp;and listening to catboat sailors. She will be\
  \ raced in Chichester Harbour and sailed&nbsp;in classic regattas in the UK on the\
  \ Continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first catboat to come to England was the <em>Una\
  \ </em>in 1852&nbsp;and her owner, Earl Mountcharles&nbsp; raced her very successfully\
  \ on London&#39;s Serpentine in front of Prince Albert and his entourage. In 1854\
  \ she was shipped down to the Solent where British writer Dixon Kemp recorded that\
  \ the sailors at Cowes,&quot;Almost regarded the <em>Una </em>as a little too marvellous\
  \ to be real...and no wonder in less than a year there was a whole fleet of <em>Unas</em>\
  \ at Cowes, and about the Solent...The Earl&#39;s sailing master,&nbsp;John Hollis,\
  \ was very perfect in the management of the <em>Una</em>, and waltzed her about\
  \ as cleverly as a Rhode Island fisherman in many sailing matches&quot;.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>The great American yachting historian William P Stephens recalled that when\
  \ the 15 foot <em>Una</em> arrived at Cowes &quot;She represented the extreme of\
  \ simplicity and manoeuverability as compared with local craft of her size and larger...her\
  \ speed and her handiness in smooth water and moderate breezes made her popular\
  \ and (in Britain) gave the name to&nbsp;the type...&#39;una boat&#39;.&quot;</p>\r\
