short_description: <p>&#39;Flycatcher&#39; is a dayboat, based on the catboats of
  New England whose original purpose was inshore fishing.&nbsp;She is designed to
  suit the shallow and sheltered waters of Chichester Harbour.</p>
full_description: "<p>James Stock, first owner and co-designer, was influenced in\
  \ his design of <em>Flycatcher </em>having sailed his cousin&#39;s Beetle Cat, <em>Breezy</em>,&nbsp;in\
  \ Nantucket Island,&nbsp;USA. This design&nbsp;first appeared in 1921 and today\
  \ Beetle Cats are ubiquitous in New England, along with many other designs of catboat.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She is designed to suit the waters of Chichester Harbour, hopefully improving\
  \ on the original Cape Cod classics with some modern materials, optimum&nbsp;hull\
  \ shape, fitting of a kicker and better performing foils;&nbsp;but maintaining the\
  \ traditional&nbsp;look&nbsp;- exemplified by Sitka and Douglas spars, ample varnished\
  \ teak trim and a beautifully cut cream sail. Excellent form stability, large cockpit\
  \ and simple rig, makes this dayboat&nbsp;ideal for singlehanded sailing or&nbsp;for\
  \ taking the family to the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James researched his design by visits\
  \ to museums in New England, observations of designs past and present, studying\
  \ the many books on the type&nbsp;and listening to catboat sailors. She will be\
  \ raced in Chichester Harbour and sailed&nbsp;in classic regattas in the UK on the\
  \ Continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first catboat to come to England was the <em>Una\
  \ </em>in 1852&nbsp;and her owner, Earl Mountcharles&nbsp; raced her very successfully\
  \ on London&#39;s Serpentine in front of Prince Albert and his entourage. In 1854\
  \ she was shipped down to the Solent where British writer Dixon Kemp recorded that\
  \ the sailors at Cowes,&quot;Almost regarded the <em>Una </em>as a little too marvellous\
  \ to be real...and no wonder in less than a year there was a whole fleet of <em>Unas</em>\
  \ at Cowes, and about the Solent...The Earl&#39;s sailing master,&nbsp;John Hollis,\
  \ was very perfect in the management of the <em>Una</em>, and waltzed her about\
  \ as cleverly as a Rhode Island fisherman in many sailing matches&quot;.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>The great American yachting historian William P Stephens recalled that when\
  \ the 15 foot <em>Una</em> arrived at Cowes &quot;She represented the extreme of\
  \ simplicity and manoeuverability as compared with local craft of her size and larger...her\
  \ speed and her handiness in smooth water and moderate breezes made her popular\
  \ and (in Britain) gave the name to&nbsp;the type...&#39;una boat&#39;.&quot;</p>\r\

  sales_text: '<strong>FLYCATCHER</strong> is a unique <strong>day boat </strong>design
    closely based on the Cape Cod <strong>Catboat </strong>of America. <strong>LOA
    14.75ft </strong>and <strong>6.9ft beam,</strong> giving great stability and carrying
    capacity for the family. The single, off white, gaff&nbsp;<strong>Catsail </strong>made
    by McNamara Sails makes for easy handling. The exceptionally strong hollow mast
    is by Noble and unstayed.<p>She was <strong>built in 2017</strong> by Cserve,
    designed by Stock &amp; Adams and featured in <strong>Classic Boat</strong>, March
    2018;&nbsp;<strong>OGA </strong>Gaffers Log&nbsp;96, March 2018; and <strong>Catboat
    Asociation </strong>(of America&nbsp;Bulletin No 175, Winter 2018.</p><p>While
    constructed with a <strong>Corecell hull</strong> with Flexiteek decks, to minimize
    maintenance, there is also a good deal of natural teak, Sitka and Douglas (spars)
    &nbsp;in the boat which is finished in Awlwood - all&nbsp;resulting in a <strong>classic
    appearance</strong>. Beige polyester cordage throughout adds to the traditional
    look. Hardware is by Harken.&nbsp;The hull below the waterline is finished in
    Coppercoat. The topsides are in Awlgrip "Stars &amp; Stripes" blue.</p><p>The
    laminated <strong>modern foils</strong> are very efficent designs and vastly improve
    perfomance and pointing ability over other catboat designs of the early 20th century.<p>The
    boat is offered with a custom built combi <strong>launching and road trailer </strong>which
    has been very lightly used since new in 2017, because the boat has been kept on
    a mooring at Bosham and has been craned in/out of the water.</p><p>Included is
    an <strong>E-Propulsion Spirit 1 motor </strong>with long shaft, which can be
    neatly mounted on the side deck, giving the equivalent of 3hp.</p><p>The boat
    has been over wintered in a dry, enclosed barn and always had a full cover protecting
    sail,&nbsp;cockpit and bright work when afloat - thus keeping the boat in<strong>
    excellent condition</strong><p>Outboard available at additional cost...<p>Location:
    Petersfield.</p>'
