full_description: "Motor lifeboat *Hilda* was built at the Niestern shipyard in Delfzijl\
  \ in 1922\nand named after the wife of the North and South Dutch Rescue Company\
  \ (NZHRM)\nsecretary H. de Booy. During her active service as a lifeboat she sailed\
  \ 411\ntimes and 540 people were rescued.   In 1929 the boat was extended by 1.30\
  \ m and\nthe 15 cm rubber fender was installed all around. Until 1930 the Hilda\
  \ was in\nservice around the isle of Schiermonnikoog with skipper Mees Toxopeus,\
  \ and after\nthis she moved to the Lemmer station before leaving the service in\
  \ 1975.   Once\nout of active service \_the *Hilda* was converted into a 2 masts\
  \ sailing yacht,\nwith a cruising ground that stretched from the Isle of Wight to\
  \ Copenhagen.\nAbout 2002 the boat was completely stripped and fitted with a new\
  \ engine.   She\nwas found in deplorable condition in 2008 and converted into a\
  \ pleasure yacht at\nthe yard S.R.F in Harlingen. Since then, trips have been made\
  \ with the *Hilda*\non European inland and coastal waters.   Her current owners\
  \ purchased her in\n2018, \_giving her a \"technical update\" \_which involved renewing\
  \ the mast and\nplates in the hull, installing motor inside cooling, and a second\
  \ plotter and\nVHF. In 2021 *Hilda* sailed to Oslo-Norway.   *Hilda* is registered\
