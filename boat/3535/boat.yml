  Motor lifeboat *Hilda* was built at the Niestern shipyard in Delfzijl
  in 1922 and named after the wife of the North and South Dutch Rescue Company
  (NZHRM) secretary H. de Booy. During her active service as a lifeboat she sailed
  411 times and 540 people were rescued. In 1929 the boat was extended by 1.30 m and
  the 15 cm rubber fender was installed all around. Until 1930 the Hilda
  was in service around the isle of Schiermonnikoog with skipper Mees Toxopeus,
  and after this she moved to the Lemmer station before leaving the service in
  1975. Once out of active service the *Hilda* was converted into a 2 masts
  sailing yacht, with a cruising ground that stretched from the Isle of Wight to
  Copenhagen. About 2002 the boat was completely stripped and fitted with a new
  engine. She was found in deplorable condition in 2008 and converted into a
  pleasure yacht at the yard S.R.F in Harlingen. Since then, trips have been made
  with the *Hilda* in European inland and coastal waters.   Her current owners
  purchased her in 2018, giving her a "technical update" which involved renewing
  the mast and plates in the hull, installing motor inside cooling, and a second
  plotter and VHF. In 2021 *Hilda* sailed to Oslo-Norway. *Hilda* is registered
  with the Nautical Association Olde Resque Glory.
