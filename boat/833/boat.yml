full_description: "<p>&#39;Martha Kathleen&#39; has spent most of her life on the
  West Coast of Scotland, based at Loch Melford, in the ownership of the same family.
  She is a massively strong gaff ketch designed by Arthur Holt and built by Holt and
  James, Heybridge, in 1977. She was the third hull to that design, a beamy tradition
  boat with plenty of internal volume and excellent seagoing qualities. Being intended
  for short-handed cruising of the Western Isles she has a gaff ketch rig, breaking
  the sail area down into easily managed sails, a powerful Thorneycroft 50 engine
  and lots of space for children and grandchildren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wide open laid iroko
  decks with a simple coach-roof for&rsquo;rard of the mizzen and a deep and secure
  self-draining cockpit aft of it. In 2005 she was moved to Brightlingsea and continued
  to be a real family boat, caring for four generations. Her original gaff mizzen
  was not very useful and she now has a Bermudan mizzen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2005
  she has had considerable work cleaning out her bilges and re-ballasting, re-caulking,
  running rigging replaced and standing rigging enhanced, new working sails and light
  air jib from James Lawrence and an asymmetric reacher from Jeckells.</p>\r\n\r\n

  sales_text: '<p>`Martha Kathleen’ is a massively strong gaff ketch designed by Arthur
    Holt and built for my parents by Holt and James, Heybridge, in 1977. She was the
    third hull to that design, a beamy tradition boat with plenty of internal volume
    and excellent seagoing qualities. Being intended for short-handed cruising of
    the Western Isles she has a gaff ketch rig, breaking the sail area down into easily
    managed sails, a powerful Thorneycroft 50 engine and lots of space for children
    and grandchildren. Wide open laid iroko decks with a simple coach-roof for’rard
    of the mizzen and a deep and secure self-draining cockpit aft of it. By their
    mid-eighties my parents were unable to use her much and we brought her south in
    2005. Since then she has had considerable work cleaning out her bilges and re-ballasting,
    re-caulking, running rigging replaced and standing rigging enhanced, new working
    sails and light air jib from James Lawrence and an asymmetric reacher from Jeckells.
    At present fitting out under cover in St Osyth, her home port is Brightlingsea.</p><p><strong>Designed
