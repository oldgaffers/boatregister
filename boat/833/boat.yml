full_description: "<p>&#39;Martha Kathleen&#39; has spent most of her life on the\
  \ West Coast of Scotland, based at Loch Melford, in the ownership of the same family.\
  \ She is a massively strong gaff ketch designed by Arthur Holt and built by Holt\
  \ and James, Heybridge, in 1977. She was the third hull to that design, a beamy\
  \ tradition boat with plenty of internal volume and excellent seagoing qualities.\
  \ Being intended for short-handed cruising of the Western Isles she has a gaff ketch\
  \ rig, breaking the sail area down into easily managed sails, a powerful Thorneycroft\
  \ 50 engine and lots of space for children and grandchildren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wide\
  \ open laid iroko decks with a simple coach-roof for&rsquo;rard of the mizzen and\
  \ a deep and secure self-draining cockpit aft of it. In 2005 she was moved to Brightlingsea\
  \ and continued to be a real family boat, caring for four generations. Her original\
  \ gaff mizzen was not very useful and she now has a Bermudan mizzen.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Since 2005 she has had considerable work cleaning out her bilges and re-ballasting,\
  \ re-caulking, running rigging replaced and standing rigging enhanced, new working\
  \ sails and light air jib from James Lawrence and an asymmetric reacher from Jeckells.</p>\r\
