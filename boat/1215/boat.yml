short_description: "With a hull purchased from North Cornwall Marine, 1984, by Ted
  Smith who fitted\nher out, *Impudence* was sailing in 1986. After several name changes,
  she\nemerged from a major refit, 2011 - 2013 as *Daisy*."
full_description: "First launched as *Impudence* 1984 - 1988, she was renamed *Florence*
  1988 -\n1991. Taking the name *Veejur* from 1992 - 2000 she reverted to *Florence*
  in\n2001. In 2008 she was purchased by Tim Stephenson and transported to\nKirkcudbright
  from Isle of Oronsay but Tim did not have time to complete all the\nwork. In 2010
  she was sold to Derek and Valerie Smith with a  leaking deck, the\nmarine ply and
  mahogany begining to deteriorate.\n\nWith the gift of a big free trailer and the
  use of a large barn with\nelectricity, *Florence* entered the barn in 2011 to emerge
  two years later as\n*Daisy*, with new epoxy deck and a complete refit."

  sales_text: "Florence emerged after a two year complete refit inside and out as
    \"Daisy\". Like\na Phoenix from the flames, she is now totally waterproofed, looks
    beautiful and\nsails like a dream. Any serious purchaser needs to visit me and
    \"Daisy\", see all\nthe work, invoices and information to appreciate her full
    worth.\n\n### Refit work\n\nAll deck fittings removed and old polyester sheathing
    removed, allowed to dry\nout, then recovered in modern glass fibre and slow cure epoxy.
    Cabin sides\nstripped, portholes removed, deck recoated with anti-slip paint,\n
    all fixtures and fittings including tabernacle and portholes rebedded on sealant\n
    and all refixed with silicone bronze and galvanised fixings as appropriate.\n\n
    The hull was stripped back to gel-coat, no osmosis was found, sanded and five\n
    coats of two pack epoxy zinc phoshate primer applied followed by top coat of two\n
    pack finish and finally antifouling.\n\nA new stainless steel propshaft was made,
    new cutlass bearing installed and\ngland packing renewed. A mast repair was carried
    out by a local boatbuilding\ncompany and a classic marine goose neck fitted.\n
    \nSails were inspected and repaired by Jessails who also made a new mainsail\n
    cover, and summer and winter cockpit and hatch covers.\n\nCabin roofs were finished
    with insulated panels between the mahogany beams which\nprevents condensation."
