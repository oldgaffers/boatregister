short_description: |-
  With a hull purchased from North Cornwall Marine, 1984, by Ted Smith who fitted
  her out, *Impudence* was sailing in 1986. After several name changes, she
  emerged from a major refit, 2011 - 2013 as *Daisy*.
full_description: |-
  First launched as *Impudence* 1984 - 1988, she was renamed *Florence* 1988 -
  1991. Taking the name *Veejur* from 1992 - 2000 she reverted to *Florence* in
  2001. In 2008 she was purchased by Tim Stephenson and transported to
  Kirkcudbright from Isle of Oronsay but Tim did not have time to complete all the
  work. In 2010 she was sold to Derek and Valerie Smith with a  leaking deck, the
  marine ply and mahogany begining to deteriorate.

  With the gift of a big free trailer and the use of a large barn with
  electricity, *Florence* entered the barn in 2011 to emerge two years later as
  *Daisy*, with new epoxy deck and a complete refit.

  sales_text: |-
    Florence emerged after a two year complete refit inside and out as "Daisy". Like
    a Phoenix from the flames, she is now totally waterproofed, looks beautiful and
    sails like a dream. Any serious purchaser needs to visit me and "Daisy", see all
    the work, invoices and information to appreciate her full worth.

    ### Refit work

    All deck fittings removed and old polyester sheathing removed, allowed to dry
    out, then recovered in modern glass fibre and slow cure epoxy. Cabin sides
    stripped, portholes removed, deck recoated with anti-slip paint,
    all fixtures and fittings including tabernacle and portholes rebedded on sealant
    and all refixed with silicone bronze and galvanised fixings as appropriate.

    The hull was stripped back to gel-coat, no osmosis was found, sanded and five
    coats of two pack epoxy zinc phoshate primer applied followed by top coat of two
    pack finish and finally antifouling.

    A new stainless steel propshaft was made, new cutlass bearing installed and
    gland packing renewed. A mast repair was carried out by a local boatbuilding
    company and a classic marine goose neck fitted.

    Sails were inspected and repaired by Jessails who also made a new mainsail
    cover, and summer and winter cockpit and hatch covers.

    Cabin roofs were finished with insulated panels between the mahogany beams which
    prevents condensation.
