short_description: <p>With a hull purchased from North Cornwall Marine, 1984, by Ted
  Smith who fitted her out, &#39;Impudence&#39; was sailing in 1986. After several
  name changes, she emerged from a major refit, 2011 - 2013 as &#39;Daisy&#39;.</p>
full_description: "<p>First launched as &#39;Impudence&#39; 1984 - 1988, she was renamed\
  \ &#39;Florence&#39; 1988 - 1991. Taking the name &#39;Veejur&#39; from 1992 - 2000\
  \ she reverted to &#39;Florence&#39; in 2001. In 2008 she was purchased by Tim Stephenson\
  \ and transported to Kirkcudbright from Isle of Oronsay but Tim did not have time\
  \ to complete all the work. In 2010 she was sold to Derek and Valerie Smith with\
  \ a &nbsp;leaking deck, the marine ply and mahogany begining to deteriorate.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>With the gift&nbsp;of a big free trailer and the use of a large barn with\
  \ electicity, &#39;Florence&#39; entered the barn in 2011 to emerge two years later\
  \ as &#39;Daisy&#39;, with new epoxy deck and a complete refit.</p>"

  sales_text: '<p>Florence emerged after a two year complete refit inside and out
    as "Daisy". Like a Phoenix from the flames, she is now totally waterproofed, looks
    beautiful and sails like a dream. Any serious purchaser needs to visit me and
    "Daisy", see all the work, invoices and information to appreciate her full worth.</p><p>The
    reason for selling is unfortunately my wife"s health problems, and age. We both
    feel it is time for "Daisy" to have the lifestyle she deserves.</p><p>Call Derek
    &amp; Val Smith: +44 (0)1557 330668</p><h3>Refit work</h3><p>All deck fittings
    removed and old polyester sheathing removed, allowed to dry out, then recovered
    in modern glass fibre and slow cure&nbsp;epoxy. Cabin sides stripped, portholes
    removed, deck recoated with anti-slip paint, all&nbsp;fixtures&nbsp;and fittings
    including tabernacle and portholes rebedded on sealant and all refixed with silicone
    bronze and galvanised fixings as appropriate.</p><p>The hull was stripped back
    to gel-coat, no osmosis was found, sanded and five coats of two pack epoxy zinc
    phoshate primer applied followed by top&nbsp;coat of two pack finish and finally
    antifouling.</p><p>A new stainless steel propshaft was made, new cutlass bearing
    installed and gland packing renewed. A mast repair was carried out by a local
    boatbuilding company and a classic marine goose neck fitted.</p><p>Sails were
    inspected and repaired by Jessails who also made a new mainsail cover, and summer
    and winter cockpit and hatch covers.</p><p>Cabin roofs were finished with insulated
    panels between the mahogany beams which prevents condensation.</p>'
