  'Felix' is a cat boat, designed by Andrew Wolstenholme and built by David Moss
  Boatbuilders in 1982.

full_description: "*Felix* was launched in 1982, the inspiration of two men: Andrew\
  \ Wolstenholme, a\nyoung designer who had spent time on the north east coast of\
  \ the USA and David\nMoss, a Lancashire boat builder. The design is influenced by\
  \ the catboat's of\nCape Cod.\n\nIn an article in ['The Boatman', April\n1996](/sites/default/files/Catboat%2016%20Felix%20The%20Boatman%201996.pdf),\n\
  Martin Tregoning discussed the catboat's design and rig, taking *Felix* as an\n\
  example. He compares catboats and gaffers for speed and stability, summing up\n\
  the article as follows:\n\n\n> The basic catboat has a well for an outboard but\
  \ 'Felix' has a small inboard to\n> give that extra security when sailing offshore.\
  \ Last year [1995] her owners\n> sailed her to the Isles of Scilly which shows a\
  \ measure of their confidence in\n> her sea-keeping abilities. All in all this boat\
  \ was great fun to sail and even\n> more, I would imagine, to own. She sailed and\
  \ handled well, an ideal daysailer\n> or even weekender for those who enjoy camping.\
  \ The new sailing horizons that she\n> could open up in any estuary or river complex\
  \ would provide a new dimension to\n> someone who has owned larger and deeper craft\
  \ but is now seeking all the fun but\n> with less work during the winter months\
  \ She is also the kind of boat that might\n> tempt an owner to keep her in the water\
  \ all year round, just to enjoy those\n> sunny days of solitude during the off season.\n\
