full_description: "<h3>In search of &#39;Felix&#39;, February 2018</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Felix&#39;\
  \ is a very distinctive boat, built in 1982, and her first owner is seeking information\
  \ about her whereabouts. If you can help, please <a href=\"mailto:log@oga.org.uk?subject=Catboat%20Felix\"\
  >contact the Editor with more details</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m\
  \ trying to trace my first wooden boat which I bought in 1982 &ndash; a 16ft Cape\
  \ Cod Catboat designed by Andrew Wolstenholme and built by David Moss, in Skipool\
  \ Creek, near Fleetwood, Lancs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sold her in 1989 to a Robin\
  \ Ford, who kept her at Maylandsea, Essex, and renamed her <i>Felix</i>. In 1993\
  \ Richard Songer bought her and she moved to Cornwall. It was Songer who made the\
  \ modifications mentioned in the article by Martin Tregoning in The Boatman (see\
  \ below). In 2002 Andrew Noquet, Tavistock Devon, bought her from Songer. He sold\
  \ her around 2006 to Mike Bell, a BA pilot in Lancashire who sold her to&nbsp;a\
  \ Ray Smith in 2012. Ray Smith died c.2015, selling &#39;Felix&#39; shortly before\
  \ his death.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Felix&#39; was launched in 1982,\
  \ the inspiration of two men: Andrew Wolstenholme, a young designer who had spent\
  \ time on the north east coast of the USA and David Moss, a Lancashire boatbuilder.\
  \ The design is influenced by the catboat&#39;s of Cape Cod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an\
  \ article in <a href=\"/sites/default/files/Catboat%2016%20Felix%20The%20Boatman%201996.pdf\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">&#39;The Boatman&#39;, April 1996</a>, Martin Tregoning discussed\
  \ the catboat&#39;s design and rig, taking &#39;Felix&#39; as an example. He compares\
  \ catboats and gaffers for speed and stability, summing up the article as follows:</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The basic catboat has a well for an outboard but &#39;Felix&#39;\
  \ has a small inboard to give that extra security when sailing offshore. Last year\
  \ [1995] her owners sailed her to the Isles of Scilly which shows a measure of their\
  \ confidence in her sea-keeping abilities. All in all this boat was great fun to\
  \ sail and even more, I would imagine, to own. She sailed and handled well, an ideal\
  \ daysailer or even weekender for those who enjoy camping. The new sailing hotizons\
  \ that she could open up in any estuary or river complex would provide a new dimension\
  \ to someone who has owned larger and deeper craft but is now seeking all the fun\
  \ but with less work during the winter months She is also the kind of boat that\
  \ might tempt an owner to keep her in the water all year round, just to enjoy those\
  \ sunny days of solitude during the off season.</p>\r\n</blockquote>"
