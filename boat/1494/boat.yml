full_description: "### In search of 'Felix', February 2018\n\n\n'Felix' is a very\
  \ distinctive boat, built in 1982, and her first owner is\nseeking information about\
  \ her whereabouts. If you can help, please [contact the\nEditor with more details](mailto:log@oga.org.uk?subject=Catboat%20Felix):\n\
  \n\n\n> \n> I\u2019m trying to trace my first wooden boat which I bought in 1982\
  \ \u2013 a 16ft Cape\n> Cod Catboat designed by Andrew Wolstenholme and built by\
  \ David Moss, in Skipool\n> Creek, near Fleetwood, Lancs.\_\n> \n> \n> I sold her\
  \ in 1989 to a Robin Ford, who kept her at Maylandsea, Essex, and\n> renamed her\
  \ *Felix*. In 1993 Richard Songer bought her and she moved to\n> Cornwall. It was\
  \ Songer who made the modifications mentioned in the article by\n> Martin Tregoning\
  \ in The Boatman (see below). In 2002 Andrew Noquet, Tavistock\n> Devon, bought\
  \ her from Songer. He sold her around 2006 to Mike Bell, a BA pilot\n> in Lancashire\
  \ who sold her to\_a Ray Smith in 2012. Ray Smith died c.2015,\n> selling 'Felix'\
  \ shortly before his death.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n'Felix' was launched in 1982, the inspiration\
  \ of two men: Andrew Wolstenholme, a\nyoung designer who had spent time on the north\
  \ east coast of the USA and David\nMoss, a Lancashire boatbuilder. The design is\
  \ influenced by the catboat's of\nCape Cod.\n\n\nIn an article in ['The Boatman',\
  \ April\n1996](/sites/default/files/Catboat%2016%20Felix%20The%20Boatman%201996.pdf),\n\
  Martin Tregoning discussed the catboat's design and rig, taking 'Felix' as an\n\
  example. He compares catboats and gaffers for speed and stability, summing up\n\
  the article as follows:\n\n\n\n> \n> The basic catboat has a well for an outboard\
  \ but 'Felix' has a small inboard to\n> give that extra security when sailing offshore.\
  \ Last year [1995] her owners\n> sailed her to the Isles of Scilly which shows a\
  \ measure of their confidence in\n> her sea-keeping abilities. All in all this boat\
  \ was great fun to sail and even\n> more, I would imagine, to own. She sailed and\
  \ handled well, an ideal daysailer\n> or even weekender for those who enjoy camping.\
  \ The new sailing hotizons that she\n> could open up in any estuary or river complex\
  \ would provide a new dimension to\n> someone who has owned larger and deeper craft\
  \ but is now seeking all the fun but\n> with less work during the winter months\
  \ She is also the kind of boat that might\n> tempt an owner to keep her in the water\
  \ all year round, just to enjoy those\n> sunny days of solitude during the off season.\n\
