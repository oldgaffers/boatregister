full_description: "Designed as 26 foot Gaff Sloop by \u201CUncle Rous\u201C vice-Commodore\
  \ of the Hong Kong\nYacht Club and a yacht designer. Around six of his yachts are\
  \ thought to have\nsurvived into the second Millennium . *Mairi Bhan* was initially\
  \ built as\n*Typhoon* in around 1930. We think she was brought to Britain between\
  \ the wars\nand renamed *Mairi*. She is in the Lloyd's register for 1962 as *Mairi\
  \ Bhan*\n(previously *Mairi*) Based in Poole.\n\nHer owner rescued her from being\
  \ scrapped about eight years ago and since then\nhas worked to bring her back to\
  \ life. In 2022 he sailed her for a full season\nprior to her being brought out\
  \ for winter berthing on the dry. She is a dream to\nsail. \_She has now been fully\
  \ restored with all the hull and decking re calked.\nCompletely rewired and a new\
  \ (reconditioned) engine fitted.\_\n\n"
