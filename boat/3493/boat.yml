full_description: "Designed as 26 foot Gaff Sloop by \u201CUncle Rous\u201C vice-Commodore\
  \ of the Hong Kong\nYacht Club and a yacht designer . Around six of his yachts are\
  \ thought to have\nsurvived into the second Millennium . Mairi Bhan was initially\
  \ built as Typhoon\nin around 1930. We think she was brought to britain between\
  \ the wars and renamed\nMairi. She is in the Loyde's register for 1962 as Mairi\
  \ Bhan (previously Mairi)\nBased in Poole.\n\nWe rescued her from being scrapped\
  \ about eight years ago and since then have\nworked to bring her back to life. \_\
  We have sailed her for a full season prior to\nbeing brought out for winter berthing\
  \ on the dry. She is a dream to sail. \_She\nhas now been fully restored with all\
  \ the hull and decking re calked. Compleatly\nrewired and a new reconditioned engine\
  \ fitted.\_\n\n"
