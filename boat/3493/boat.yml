short_description: Designed as 26 foot Gaff Sloop and converted to Bermudan rig in
  the 60's
full_description: |-
  Designed as 26 foot Gaff Sloop by “Uncle Rous“ vice-Commodore of the Hong Kong
  Yacht Club and a yacht designer. Around six of his yachts are thought to have
  survived into the second Millennium. *Mairi Bhan* was initially built as
  *Typhoon* in 1934. We think she was brought to Britain between the wars and
  renamed *Mairi*. She is in the Lloyd's register for 1961 as *Mairi Bhan*
  (previously *Mairi*) Based in Poole.


  Her owner rescued her from being scrapped about eight years ago and since then
  has worked to bring her back to life. In 2022 he sailed her for a full season
  prior to her being brought out for winter berthing on the dry. She is a dream to
  sail.  She has now been fully restored with all the hull and decking re calked.
  Completely rewired and a new (reconditioned) engine fitted.
