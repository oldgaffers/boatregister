full_description: "<p>Paul Winch, builder and designer, describes the background to\
  \ building &#39;Sunlight&#39; and her main features. This article was first published\
  \ in 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>lt started with a commission to design a barge\
  \ yacht in ferro-cement, in 1963. I managed to persuade the owner to build in steel\
  \ (being much better for sitting on rocks, old engines and the like for one thing)\
  \ and in the end, via many trial designs, we went for a very fine-lined vessel which\
  \ has sailed extensively since she was built in 1970. She is &lsquo;Halfway&rsquo;,\
  \ sprit rigged much against my wishes. From the beginning I accepted certain challenges\
  \ and was determined to overcome the traditional and undisputed potential faults\
  \ of the flat-bottomed vessel. I feel that we have succeeded, certainly with regard\
  \ to the important ones like range of stability and freedom from pounding.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>A recent discussion with the owner of &lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo;,\
  \ undoubtedly one of the best of the traditional barge yachts, showed up the strengths\
  \ and weaknesses of the marque. Compared with &lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo;, and her\
  \ near sister &lsquo;Dione&rsquo;, we have far better accommodation with good standing\
  \ headroom even in our smaller version (27&rsquo; as opposed to their 30&rsquo;).\
  \ All sail well when you know how to get the best out of them. We don&#39;t pound\
  \ whereas they do somewhat, though less than you might expect.</blockquote>\r\n\r\
  \n<blockquote>All these barge yachts (&lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo;, &lsquo;Dione&rsquo;,\
  \ our E27 and E33 classes) are somewhat heavy (ours are very heavy) and this affects\
  \ handling techniques. You need to keep the craft moving, but at least with ours\
  \ you will not get caught in stays in the traditional sense. We don&#39;t back any\
  \ headsail when tacking. You can however get stuck on the new tack if you allow\
  \ her to lose steerage way (and this is more likely in a chop), and to get going\
  \ again the distribution of sails is important.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I\
  \ understand that the two earlier barges mentioned, like ours, cannot sail under\
  \ mainsail only, and they need the jib rather than the foresail to balance the main,\
  \ if not both (all these craft are cutter rigged). With the proper sail combinations\
  \ however &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; (and I think the others - certainly ours) will\
  \ handle like a dinghy in light winds, and balance very well under reefed main and\
  \ jib or foresail. &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; also sails well under foresail only (but\
  \ she won&#39;t usually tack), or under headsails and mizzen (when she will tack\
  \ positively, and this is very useful single-handed)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Some\
  \ sailing techniques do carry over from the full-size barges, particularly the need\
  \ for full sails and sailing full. Baggy sails can let one surprisingly close to\
  \ the wind as more up-to-date racing helmsmen know. Sunlight&#39;s sails are in\
  \ fact too flat, the mainsail much too much so. The main is roller reefed, so needs\
  \ to be laced, but we expect better results from a loose-footed mainsail currently\
  \ on order for another boat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I am told that full-size\
  \ barges will not heave-to. This is probably due to the rig rather than the hulls\
  \ and boomy barges may have done this perfectly well. Our barge yachts (and I understand\
  \ &lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo; also) heave-to well and we do this many times every trip\
  \ when short-handed to raise or lower sails. On &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; the wheel\
  \ is hydraulic and self-locking, which is a great boon for the helmsman who can\
  \ leave the helm to attend to leeboards and assist with headsails if necessary.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>The barge yachts sail themselves well on many points of sailing\
  \ and this also enables the helmsman to go forward or into the cabin to attend to\
  \ other matters. When tacking, both boards can be left down if preferred. We have\
  \ not ascertained what loss of speed results, but there is certainly no structural\
  \ problem, the windward board floating out as far as necessary. Our leeboards are\
  \ unusual in that they tuck within the overall beam of the vessel - which has flared\
  \ sides - when housed. In future we will be fitting rubber blocks to fender the\
  \ housed boards and this will reduce the tapping noise they produce when the vessel\
  \ rolls with the boards raised. Otherwise we stuff in fenders.</blockquote>\r\n\r\
  \n<blockquote>&lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; has a lovely easy rolling motion at sea - no\
  \ gimballed cooker required, and things put down generally stay put. This includes\
  \ an unsecured coal hod in one vessel. On the wind we generally sail at a steady\
  \ 15 degrees in a breeze. Maximum yet recorded is 25 degrees in an OGA race. The\
  \ general feel is that of a keelboat, and the range of stability (typically 1-17\
  \ degrees) is similar to keel boats, better than most traditional craft, keels or\
  \ otherwise.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We have not sailed &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo;\
  \ so long nor so far as we would wish. Extreme pressure of work-limits our sailing\
  \ to the Thames Estuary with quick sorties across to Essex and Suffolk. Our dream\
  \ this year is to get away long enough to join the OGA cruise in company to Holland.\
  \ Our aspirations go much further, however, and if we had the opportunity we would\
  \ be sailing &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; to Brittany via Norway and maybe Finland, looking\
  \ at inland seas and enjoying drying harbours on the way, then maybe to continue\
  \ through the canals and rivers to the Mediterranean, coming back &lsquo;outside&rsquo;.\
  \ That is the sort of cruising for which &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; was designed and\
  \ built.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; is the first of\
  \ the &lsquo;Eastcountryman 33&rsquo; class. Her dimensions are 49&rsquo; overall,\
  \ 33&rsquo; length on deck, very nearly this on the waterline, beam 11&rsquo;, draft\
  \ 2&#39; 6&quot; boards up, headroom generally 6&#39; 10&quot; (just under 6&rsquo;\
  \ in the aft cabin), displacement 13 tons, engine BUKH 36 bhp diesel, 7 knots on\
  \ full power (which we have never needed yet), fuel 80 gallons, water 250 gallons.\
  \ The layout below decks will have a total of seven berths (or rather berths for\
  \ seven persons since two are double) including an occasional berth in the forepeak,\
  \ and excluding the settee in the saloon which could accommodate a small person\
  \ or child. However the layout is intended to accommodate say four in domestic comfort\
  \ with the saloon purely for eating and relaxing - with lots of room for that, and\
  \ for eating your own dinner and not that of your neighbour - and with the quarter\
  \ berths in the galley/chart room regarded as the only two sea berths. The aft cabin\
  \ has a separate WC and shower and is self-contained.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A\
  \ coal stove will operate central heating throughout the boat, and a pressure system\
  \ will supply both heads and the galley and showers with hot and cold water from\
  \ the ample tankage available. An unusual feature is a skin cooling tank for the\
  \ engine to facilitate operation in muddy waters (and indeed in mud), and she also\
  \ has a weedhatch giving access to the propeller from the aft cabin in the event\
  \ of picking up debris on the screw, which we have already needed to use four times.\
  \ Construction is steel, 10mm bottom, 6mm side and lesser thicknesses higher up\
  \ with a laminated ply cabin top to give a very low centre of gravity. She has timber\
  \ bulwarks with carved decorative badges, and a vessel we are building now has the\
  \ owners&#39; motif on each bow, which will be very pretty.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\
  <blockquote>We are interested in building other traditional types and we have discussed\
  \ yacht Mersey Flats and yacht wherries with clients, as well as Scandinavian type\
  \ double-enders. And (can I say it in this magazine?) modern Bermudan rigged shoal\
  \ draft steel craft. Back to the &lsquo;Eastcountryman&#39;, we can build up to\
  \ nearly 60&rsquo; under cover and are currently discussing a cargo carrying version,\
  \ which would be a nice turn to the wheel of fortune (or if not fortune, keep us\
  \ busy!)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>by Paul Winch<br />\r\nFirst published in the Old\
