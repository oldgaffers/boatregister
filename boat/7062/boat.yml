  \ and watertight but is currently in primer and needing a topcoat. The interior\
  \ is sound but in need of attention, retaining most of its original fittings. Full\
  \ standing headroom, no heads. Currently cutter rigged with retracting furling gear\
  \ fitted to bowspit and a tabernacle stepped mast. Traditional red sails in useable\
  \ condition. Engine is said to be serviceable. Good useable cockpit tent/cover.\
  \ Mast butt end has a split but this could be easily repaired.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>"

  sales_text: <p>A Hillyard 28" wooden Bermudan cutter,&nbsp;7 ton, built 1931 and
    on the Hillyard Register,&nbsp;"Fortuna III" is recognised as a sister ship to
    the "Nancy Blackett" (Arthur Ransomes" yacht) and has become available for purchase
    due to sad and unforseen circumstances.</p><p>This description has been prepared&nbsp;for
    someone who has become to ill to look after her, and any prospective purchaser
    should satisfy themselves as to its accuracy as no warranty/guarantee is either
    given or implied. There is no available survey, so your own inspection is required.</p><p>She
    is currently on the Hard at Watchet Harbour and easy to view. Unusually, for a
    larger Hillyard, she is transom&nbsp;sterned and was originally a masthead sloop.</p><p>The
    hull appears sound and watertight but is currently in primer and needing a topcoat.
    The interior is sound but in need of attention, retaining most of its original
    fittings. Full standing headroom, no heads.</p><p>Currently cutter rigged with
    retracting furling gear fitted to bowspit and a tabernacle stepped mast. Traditional
    red sails in useable condition. Engine is said to be serviceable. Good useable
    cockpit tent/cover.</p><p>Mast butt end has a split but this could be easily repaired.</p><p>My
    personal only concern is some rot to the deck. The deck has been sheathed, but
    exposed in this area for assessment.</p><p>Harbour fees for April 2018 onwards
    will be due on purchase.</p><p>I believe that at this price she is an absolute
    gem - but will need considerable skills and attention. Had I not already possessed
    a Hillyard (which requires her own attention!) I would have had no hesitaion in
    buying her for myself. Please feel free to contact me for more details (such as
    I can supply) and to arrange <strong>viewing by appointment only</strong>.</p>
