full_description: "<p>A Hillyard 28&#39; wooden Bermudan cutter,&nbsp;7 ton, built\
  \ 1931 and on the Hillyard Register,&nbsp;&#39;Fortuna III&#39; is recognised as\
  \ a sister ship to the &#39;Nancy Blackett&#39; (Arthur Ransomes&#39; yacht).</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Unusually, for a larger Hillyard, she is transom&nbsp;sterned\
  \ and was originally a masthead sloop. She was placed on the market in April, 2018\
  \ when the following was included in the sale notice: &quot;The hull appears sound\
  \ and watertight but is currently in primer and needing a topcoat. The interior\
  \ is sound but in need of attention, retaining most of its original fittings. Full\
  \ standing headroom, no heads. Currently cutter rigged with retracting furling gear\
  \ fitted to bowspit and a tabernacle stepped mast. Traditional red sails in useable\
  \ condition. Engine is said to be serviceable. Good useable cockpit tent/cover.\
  \ Mast butt end has a split but this could be easily repaired.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>"
