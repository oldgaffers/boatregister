full_description: |+
  *Swallow* was bought to replace an earlier wooden Heron which was sadly
  suffering from terminal rot. She was sailed out of Coquet Yacht Club in
  Northumberland, and in 2019 won the Harris Trophy for overall winner of the
  North East OGA Championships competing against some boats twice her size. She
  has recently been moved south and currently sails out of Priory SC near Bedford.
  She will be taking part in the OGA 60th Anniversary in Suffolk.
