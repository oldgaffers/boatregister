    \ with\nracing successes, refined from midships-aft to produce a handsome counter\
    \ stern\nyacht. Sail plan said to have been designed by Maurice Griffiths. A sturdy\n\
    vessel, perfectly balanced and a delight to sail. Well suited to solo passage\n\
    making.   Accommodates 4 adults comfortably.\n\n### Extensively re- furbished from\
