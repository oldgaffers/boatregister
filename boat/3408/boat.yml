full_description: <i>Ceres</i> was built by Everson &amp; Sons of Woodbridge along
  lines lifted from a retired fishing smack, then refined from amidships aft to produce
  a handsome, counter-sterned yacht with a Maurice Griffiths designed sail plan.<p>She
  is a sturdy vessel, perfectly balanced and a delight to sail, with excellent sail
  options for a vessel of this type.<p>She was refurbished by John Wragg between 2001
  and 2007.<p>After an on-water survey by Adrian Overbury, Rod Daniel bought her in
  December 2019 and renamed her <i>Ceres</i>. The Woodbridge Boatyard (formerly Everson's)
  is responsible for her 60<sup>th</sup> Birthday refurbishment.
