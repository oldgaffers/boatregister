short_description: <p>Phil Bolger designed Lynx&nbsp;</p>
full_description: <p>Built in Essex in early 80s by the cold moulded system. One of
  probably two ever built in the UK, first being "Buffo" as featured in The Bullimore
  Fleet Classic Boat No 106 March 1997. She was built slightly larger than Phil Bolger's
  original design with a different interior to accommodate the Yanmar Diesel engine
  and a curved bowsprit was added in the late 90s which retains the tradition of East
  coast catboat design. Her relatively deep keel incorporating 200kg of lead make
  a stiff able pocket cruiser.</p>
