short_description: "`Rowspar\u2019 is an Itchen Ferry yacht built in 1926 by Berthon\
  \ Boat Co.\n\n"
full_description: "Rowspar was built by Berthon Boat Co. in Lymington in 1925/6. She\
  \ was kept at Lymington until the 1950s.Originally called White Kitten, after a\
  \ few years her name was changed to\nSparrow and then as her registry had lapsed,\
  \ and another boat had been named\nSparrow, she was renamed Rowspar as an anagram.In\
  \ 1984 Rowspar was sold to\nsomeone in Emsworth where she remained through several\
  \ owners until 2012/13. She\nwas totally restored in 1999 by Spence Mooney and Chidham\
  \ Marine, to a very high\nstandard, using the best materials and retaining the traditional\
  \ character. She\nis extremely strongly built, planked in pitch pine on oak frames,\
  \ with bronze\nfittings and hand-spliced stainless-steel rigging. She has a beautiful\
  \ interior\nwith the cabin all lined out in teak. Unusually for a boat of her size,\
  \ she has\ngood headroom of around 5\u20198\u201D in the main cabin and a Taylors\
  \ cooker with an\noven.The cabin has two settee berths, a table, a sink, chart table\
  \ with VHF &\nGPS, and plenty of locker space. There is less headroom in the foc'sle\
  \ which\ncontains the heads, sail storage space, hanging cupboard, more lockers\
  \ and a\nthird bunk. She is very comfortable for cruising for 2 people or even 3.She\
  \ is\nrigged as a gaff cutter with optional topsail, and has a number of spare\n\
  foresails. The cockpit is also beautifully fitted out in teak and is\nwell-protected\
  \ by coamings all round, and there is plenty of locker space here\nas well.John\
  \ Hall bought her in November 2011 and kept her on a mooring in\nBosham Channel\
  \ in the summer of 2012. After wintering in Emsworth Yacht Harbour,\nshe was then\
  \ moored at Wicor Yacht Haven in Portsmouth Harbour. She has raced in\nthe past\
  \ under a previous owner who also took her to the Fowey Classics. She is\nused mainly\
  \ for cruising and OGA rallies in the Solent area, a classic\ngentleman\u2019s yacht,\
  \ much admired wherever she goes.\n\n"
