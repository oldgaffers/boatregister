  *Rowspar* is an Itchen Ferry yacht built in 1926 by Berthon Boat Co.
full_description: |+
  *Rowspar* was built by Berthon Boat Co. in Lymington in 1925/6.
  She was kept at\nLymington until the 1950s. Originally called *White Kitten*, after
  a few years her name was changed to *Sparrow* and then as her registry had lapsed,
  and another boat had been named *Sparrow*, she was renamed *Rowspar* as an anagram.

  In 1984 *Rowspar* was sold to someone in Emsworth where she remained through
  several owners until 2012/13. She was totally restored in 1999 by Spence Mooney
  and Chidham Marine, to a very high standard, using the best materials and retaining
  the traditional character. She is extremely strongly built, planked in pitch
  pine on oak frames, with bronze fittings and hand-spliced stainless-steel rigging.
  She has a beautiful interior with the cabin all lined out in teak. Unusually
  for a boat of her size, she has good headroom of around 5'8'' in the
  main cabin and a Taylors cooker with an oven.
  
  The cabin has two settee berths, a table, a sink, chart table with VHF & GPS,
  and plenty of locker space. There is less headroom in the foc'sle which contains
  the heads, sail storage space, hanging cupboard, more lockers and a third bunk.
  She is very comfortable for cruising for 2 people or even 3.
  
  She is rigged as a gaff cutter with optional
  topsail, and has a number of spare foresails. The cockpit is also beautifully
  fitted out in teak and is well-protected by coamings all round, and there is
  plenty of locker space here as well.John Hall bought her in November 2011 and
  kept her on a mooring in Bosham Channel in the summer of 2012. After wintering
  in Emsworth Yacht Harbour, she was then moored at Wicor Yacht Haven in Portsmouth
  Harbour. She has raced in the past under a previous owner who also took her to
  the Fowey Classics.

  Until 2022 she was used mainly for cruising and OGA rallies
  in the Solent area. This classic gentleman's yacht, much admired wherever
  she goes, has now been sold to sail on the Italian lakes.
