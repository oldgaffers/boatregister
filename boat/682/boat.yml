short_description: "`Rowspar\u2019 is an Itchen Ferry yacht built in 1926 by Berthon\
  \ Boat Co."
full_description: "Rowspar was built by Berthon Boat Co. in Lymington in 1925/6. She\
  \ was kept at Lymington until the 1950s.<p>Originally called White Kitten, after\
  \ a few years her name was changed to Sparrow and then as her registry had lapsed,\
  \ and another boat had been named Sparrow, she was renamed Rowspar as an anagram.<p>In\
  \ 1984 Rowspar was sold to someone in Emsworth where she remained through several\
  \ owners until 2012/13. She was totally restored in 1999 by Spence Mooney and Chidham\
  \ Marine, to a very high standard, using the best materials and retaining the traditional\
  \ character. She is extremely strongly built, planked in pitch pine on oak frames,\
  \ with bronze fittings and hand-spliced stainless-steel rigging. <p>She has a beautiful\
  \ interior with the cabin all lined out in teak. Unusually for a boat of her size,\
  \ she has good headroom of around 5\u20198\u201D in the main cabin and a Taylors\
  \ cooker with an oven.<p>The cabin has two settee berths, a table, a sink, chart\
  \ table with VHF &amp; GPS, and plenty of locker space. There is less headroom in\
  \ the foc&#39;sle which contains the heads, sail storage space, hanging cupboard,\
  \ more lockers and a third bunk. She is very comfortable for cruising for 2 people\
  \ or even 3.<p>She is rigged as a gaff cutter with optional topsail, and has a number\
  \ of spare foresails. The cockpit is also beautifully fitted out in teak and is\
  \ well-protected by coamings all round, and there is plenty of locker space here\
  \ as well.<p>John Hall bought her in November 2011 and kept her on a mooring in\
  \ Bosham Channel in the summer of 2012. After wintering in Emsworth Yacht Harbour,\
  \ she was then moored at Wicor Yacht Haven in Portsmouth Harbour. She has raced\
  \ in the past under a previous owner who also took her to the Fowey Classics. She\
  \ is used mainly for cruising and OGA rallies in the Solent area, a classic gentleman\u2019\
  s yacht, much admired wherever she goes."
