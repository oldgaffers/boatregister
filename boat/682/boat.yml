short_description: "`Rowspar\u2019 is an Itchen Ferry yacht built in 1926 by Berthon\
  \ Boat Co.\n\n"
full_description: "*Rowspar* was built by Berthon Boat Co. in Lymington in 1925/6.\
  \ She was kept at\nLymington until the 1950s.Originally called *White Kitten*, after\
  \ a few years\nher name was changed to *Sparrow* and then as her registry had lapsed,\
  \ and\nanother boat had been named *Sparrow*, she was renamed *Rowspar* as an anagram.\n\
  \nIn 1984 *Rowspar* was sold to someone in Emsworth where she remained through\n\
  several owners until 2012/13. She was totally restored in 1999 by Spence Mooney\n\
  and Chidham Marine, to a very high standard, using the best materials and\nretaining\
  \ the traditional character. She is extremely strongly built, planked in\npitch\
  \ pine on oak frames, with bronze fittings and hand-spliced stainless-steel\nrigging.\
  \ She has a beautiful interior with the cabin all lined out in teak.\nUnusually\
  \ for a boat of her size, she has good headroom of around 5\u20198\u201D in the\n\
  main cabin and a Taylors cooker with an oven.\n\nThe cabin has two settee berths,\
  \ a table, a sink, chart table with VHF & GPS,\nand plenty of locker space. There\
  \ is less headroom in the foc'sle which contains\nthe heads, sail storage space,\
  \ hanging cupboard, more lockers and a third bunk.\nShe is very comfortable for\
  \ cruising for 2 people or even 3.\n\nShe is rigged as a gaff cutter with optional\
  \ topsail, and has a number of spare\nforesails. The cockpit is also beautifully\
  \ fitted out in teak and is\nwell-protected by coamings all round, and there is\
  \ plenty of locker space here\nas well.John Hall bought her in November 2011 and\
  \ kept her on a mooring in\nBosham Channel in the summer of 2012. After wintering\
  \ in Emsworth Yacht Harbour,\nshe was then moored at Wicor Yacht Haven in Portsmouth\
  \ Harbour. She has raced in\nthe past under a previous owner who also took her to\
  \ the Fowey Classics.\_\n\nUntil 2022 she was used mainly for cruising and OGA rallies\
  \ in the Solent area.\nThis classic gentleman\u2019s yacht, much admired wherever\
  \ she goes, has now been\nsold to sail on the Italian lakes.\n\n"
