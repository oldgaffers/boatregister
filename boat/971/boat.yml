  *Stormalong* is currently on the River Rance and is in need of significant work
  to bring her back into the wonderful cruising boat she has been.
full_description: |-
  Designed by William KellyÂ *Stormalong* is built of pitch pine on oak, Bill Kelly
  made the mast himself in his front garden from a pine tree he had selected. In
  1972 Peter Cumberlidge and his father, Jack, found *Stormalong* in a rather
  sorry state on a mud-berth on the River Dart and bought her. Peter died in 2019
  and his beloved boat has been sadly neglected since then. Much as I would like
  to keep her I know this is not realistic and she needs new, active and capable
  owners.


  During the 47 years Peter owned her she cruised the French waterways from the
  Channel to the Med, coming back through the Canal du Midi and across Biscay. In
  the 1980s and 90s we went to the Baltic, the Netherlands and the north coast of
  Spain. *Stormalong's* regular cruising grounds were the West Country, Channel
  Islands, the north and south coasts of Brittany and the Biscay coast of France.


  In 1990 her petrol Watermotor engine was replaced with a Perkins Perama with an
  Aquadrive. Some work on the starboard side hull was carried out by a wooden boat
  yard in Douarnenez in 2013.
