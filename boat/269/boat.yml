  *Lillibullero* is one of many boats on the East Coast of England who has crossed
  the North Sea and back several times throughout her history. Built in Boston,
  Linconlshire, in 1932 she was bought by a Dutchman for his honeymoon and in 2009
  returned to the River Stour. Her owner returned to the Netherlands in 2014 for
  the Netherlands OGA 'Cross Country Cruise'.

full_description: "*Lillibullero* was built in Boston (Lincolnshire), 1932, by A.M (Alexander)
  Gostelow for Mr W.H Johnston. A.M Gostelow was born in 1880 in Rosegarth Street,
  Boston. Between 1901 and 1948 when he died, A.M Gostelow built about 28 fishing
  smacks and 15 yachts. Lillibullero was built as the second of three sister ships.
  The third yacht of this threesome, Eleanor, which was slightly bigger was sailed
  to North America in 1978/1979 but struck a reef in the Caribbean and sank. The
  first of the three sisters was Privateer. She was built in 1931 for H.A Kemlo,
  an Ipswich solicitor. For a long time (1966 - 1998) Privateer was owned by Martin
  Eve who recorded his adventures with Privateer in &ldquotAn Old Gaffer's Tale&rdquot
  (Seafarer Books, 1984). The book shows a picture of Lillibullero moored at Pin
  Mill on the River Orwell just before she was sold in 1977 to a Dutch owner.
  Lillibullero
  and Privateer met again at the Shotley Point Classic Boat festival in 1995.W.H
  Johnston gave a fine account of building and fitting out Lillibullero in the
  classic book &ldquot;Building a Little Ship&rdquot; (George Allen & Unwin Ltd,
  1935). A first print copy of the book, signed by the author, belongs to the ship's
  inventory. In this book Mr Johnston wanted to show 'that a decent cruising yacht
  with engine and all the necessary equipment could be built and fitted out for
  the price of a medium-sized car' That is in the 1930s. Actually the building
  and fitting out of Lillibullero summed up to Â£298 and two shillings. Four
  opening ports that Johnston bought second hand in Brentford remain in use on
  board.  Lillibullero features in &ldquot;Gaff-rigged out of Boston&rdquot, a small
  paperback by S.R Wright published in 1991. Lillibullero is not known for her
  famous voyages yet she is a very solid and trustworthy little gaffer.  With
  her first Dutch owner, Ab Venstra, who bought her on his honeymoon, she was shipwrecked
  on the East Coast of England. Her transom, several frames and planks were replaced.
  Ab Venstra also lowered the coachroof before he sailed her back to Holland losing
  some headroom but gaining a lot in looks. In 1990/1991 she needed major maintenance.
  Peter Kruitwagen and Gosine Broersen replaced her stem timber, cockpit and interior.
  They also repaired several frames and planks. Over the years (1990-2010) Peter
  and Gosine replaced about 30% of her hull planking. During the 1990s Lillibullero
  has been back to England twice to visit the Shotley Classic Boat and Beer festival.
  She also attended every Dutch Classic Yacht Regatta at Hellevoetsluis from 1991
  to 2009.
