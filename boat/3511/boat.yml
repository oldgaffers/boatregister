    An incredible boat with an impressive logbook.  Young Larry cruised extensively
    in the Mediterranean; transitted the NWP and circumnavigated North America in
    2010-11; she returned to Western Greenland and Baffin Island; and has been
    cruising on the West Coast of Scotland since 2019. She is as solid a cruising
    boat as you can imagine.  New mainsail 2021, new topsail 2022, new galley stove
    2022.  Absolutely gorgeous below.  Engine is a Yanmar 45 hp and is in good
    shape.  Well maintained and currently being well looked after in Kerrera.
