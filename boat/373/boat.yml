full_description: "<p>&#39;Little Apple&#39; was built by Paynters in 1905. At some\
  \ point, probably in the 1920s, she was renamed &#39;White Heather&#39;. She had\
  \ a mixed career of oyster dredging, racing and day sailing. An extensive restoration\
  \ was carried out around 1960, including the fitting of an iron keel. After a change\
  \ of owner in the late 1960s she was neglected, sunk by a paint float from Falmouth\
  \ Docks and subsequently salvaged to Penryn Creek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1970 she was\
  \ transported by road and ferry to Guernsey and got sailing again. From 1973 she\
  \ was based at Ferrybridge, Portland Harbour, back under the name &#39;Little Apple&#39;.\
  \ She was the first winner of the Edgar March memorial trophy. A feat repeated some\
  \ years later. She was at the first Bucktrout and St Malo Rally in 1977.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>In 1979 the cabin top was added. A further major refit took place in 1992.</p>"
