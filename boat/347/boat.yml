full_description: "<blockquote>The newly qualified Barry pilot Lewis Alexander commissioned\
  \ Armour Brothers, of Fleetwood, to build a pilot cutter for him because William\
  \ Stoba, the foreman shipwright who had designed &#39;Alpha&#39;, the highly successful\
  \ Newport pilot cutter of 1904, worked for them. Lewis Alexander wanted a boat that\
  \ could beat &#39;Alpha&#39;,and in November 1911 the result, &#39;Kindly Light&#39;\
  \ ,was launched and sailed to Barry in south Wales. Costing &pound;500, about 40%\
  \ more than her contemporary cutters, she had a fine high bow, lean entry and well\
  \ hollowed lines below the waterline, which blended into her deep keel. She represents\
  \ the final evolution of the Bristol Channel sailing pilot cutter and was considered\
  \ to be the fastest and most successful of over 100 pilot cutters working in the\
  \ Bristol Channel immediately before the First World War.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ 1960 &#39;Theodora&#39; was the founding vessel of the Ocean Youth Club (later\
  \ known as the Ocean Youth Trust) and took young people to sea for eleven years\
  \ before being sold to the Maritime Trust in 1971. She took part in the early OGA\
  \ East Coast Races during 1966 - 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1975 she reverted to the\
  \ name &#39;Kindly Light&#39; and two years later was loaned to the Cardiff Industrial\
  \ and Maritime Museum to become an exhibit in a dry dock. Her condition deteriorated\
  \ and no funds were available to repair her. In 1993 she was sold by the Maritime\
  \ Trust to a private owner, Malcolm McKeand on condition that he restored her, and\
  \ was moved to Lymington and then Queek Quay for a complete rebuild.</p>"
