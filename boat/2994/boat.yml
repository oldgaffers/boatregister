  sales_text: "I am reluctantly \u201Cdownsizing\" due to advancing years (mine, not\
    \ hers!) after\nmany seasons of wonderful sailing. It is important to me that\
    \ a new owner will\ncherish her with the attention she deserves.\n\nDesigned and\
    \ built without an engine she has always manoeuvred under her own\ncanvas with\
    \ very few exceptions. In spite of her weight and wide beam she sails\nwell in\
    \ all wind strengths being easy on the helm, well-balanced, responsive and\nclose-winded.\
    \ She has always performed creditably in OGA events.\n\nWintered each year ashore\
    \ under cover in the shed in which she was built, she\nhas been well maintained\
    \ and is in good condition throughout.\n\nShe has cruised widely on the West coast,\
    \ from the Hebrides to Belle Ile and\nAchill Head to Looe, visiting a total of\
    \ over 125 ports and anchorages.\n\nShe comes with all her cruising equipment(except\
    \ Sextant and Chronometer), a\nNeptune wind-vane Self-steering gear, a comprehensive\
    \ sail wardrobe and a\nsubstantial Yard Trailer.\n\nA full description of \u201C\
    Happy Quest\" on DVD can be obtained on request from me.\n\nLying afloat and in\
    \ commission at Pembroke Dock.\n\n"
