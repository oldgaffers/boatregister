  sales_text: |-
    I am reluctantly “downsizing" due to advancing years (mine, not hers!) after
    many seasons of wonderful sailing. It is important to me that a new owner will
    cherish her with the attention she deserves.


    Designed and built without an engine she has always manoeuvred under her own
    canvas with very few exceptions. In spite of her weight and wide beam she sails
    well in all wind strengths being easy on the helm, well-balanced, responsive and
    close-winded. She has always performed creditably in OGA events.


    Wintered each year ashore under cover in the shed in which she was built, she
    has been well maintained and is in good condition throughout.


    She has cruised widely on the West coast, from the Hebrides to Belle Ile and
    Achill Head to Looe, visiting a total of over 125 ports and anchorages.


    She comes with all her cruising equipment(except Sextant and Chronometer), a
    Neptune wind-vane Self-steering gear, a comprehensive sail wardrobe and a
    substantial Yard Trailer.


    A full description of “Happy Quest" on DVD can be obtained on request from me.


    Lying afloat and in commission at Pembroke Dock.
