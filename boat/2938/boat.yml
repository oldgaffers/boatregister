  in the early 2000s.
full_description: |+
  Built in San Diego, California in 1904, she is an extreme plank-on-edge “lead mine” (narrow beam, very deep draft, V shaped in section with all the ballast inside the boat).The designer is unknown but Kunhardt developed a GL Watson inspired rig.
  Originally she was raced successfully and later was used for chartering. She was
  re-built in 1982-3 with the keelson as the only original piece of timber left.
  She is double planked in cedar to the waterline with light timbers of iron wood.
  The topsides are fir and the deck is triple planked finished in Port Orford
  cedar.She was imported into the UK in 2003 and in five years had three owners
  who improved her but did little sailing as her spars and sail plan was
  over-canvassed. This resulted in excessive weather helm and an un-seaworthy
  boat. Anthony Wheaton purchased her in 2008 and is continuing her improvement.
  He has replaced the over-canvassed rig which had a boom that overhung the
  counter by 10ft with a balanced sail plan designed by Ed Burnett.

  sales_text: Aeolus is the perfect vessel for the purist classic yachtsman for racing
    and cruising. Steeped in history, she was built in California in 1904 as a plank-on-edge
    yacht with a towering rig. Her traditional appearance continues throughout with
    traditional ropes, authentic block and tackles. Of course, looks aren’t the only
    thing going for this classic yacht. The redesigned sail plan by Ed Burnett uses
    modern sailcloth to give the boat power and speed when slicing through the waves.
    Think of her as a lightweight pilot cutter. This yacht is one of the most cool
    and recognisable classic boats in the UK and was featured twice out of 1500 boats
    in the Round the Island Race 2021 official videoclip (see below). Where ever moored,
    she attracts visits from envious sailors and from the public. She has active followers
    on her website, facebook and Instagram pages. http://www.roundtheisland.org.uk/web/code/php/main\\_c.php?map=rir22&ui=rir5&style=std&override=&section=multimedia&page=videolibrary
