full_description: |-
  Built in San Diego, California in 1904, she is an extreme plank-on-edge “lead
  mine” (narrow beam, very deep draft, V shaped in section with all the ballast
  inside the boat).The designer is unknown but Kunhardt developed a GL Watson
  inspired rig. Originally she was raced successfully and later was used for
  chartering. She was re-built in 1982-3 with the keelson as the only original
  piece of timber left. She is double planked in cedar to the waterline with light
  timbers of iron wood. The topsides are fir and the deck is triple planked
  finished in Port Orford cedar.She was imported into the UK in 2003 and in five
  years had three owners who improved her but did little sailing as her spars and
  sail plan was over-canvassed. This resulted in excessive weather helm and an
  un-seaworthy boat. Anthony Wheaton purchased her in 2008 and is continuing her
  improvement. He has replaced the over-canvassed rig which had a boom that
  overhung the counter by 10ft with a balanced sail plan designed by Ed Burnett.
