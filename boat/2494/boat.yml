full_description: |-
  Owned from new by Anthony John (Gubby) Williams and Christine Alma (nee Thery)
  Williams, Minstrel was built to a commissioned design by A J Williams & R Feloy
  at Totnes.


  She cruised to the Carribean 1991-2 then to Maine for three years returning to
  Southern Ireland in 1995 and was moored at Hare Island, Skibbern for several
  years.


  Following a refit in 2008 she carries a Cornish Yard topsail, bigger in the
  hoist than the mainsail luff. Yard is aluminium but will be replaced by wood.
  She has cruised the western English Channel and circumnavigated Britian via
  Caledonian Canal, taking part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge in 2013.
