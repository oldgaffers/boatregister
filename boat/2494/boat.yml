    1991 Gaff Cutter, Minstrel, with BETA BV 1505 37.5hp diesel engine. ‘Minstrel’
    is an elegant but strong ocean going cutter. Built as a ‘one off’ by Robin Feloy
    and Gubby Williams in Totnes, Devon, Minstrel was built for Mr & Mrs Williams
    for their dream trip of the North Atlantic circuit, visiting Spain, Portugal,
    the Canaries, the Bahamas, the Florida coast and up to New York between 1992 and
    1995. The current owner purchase the boat from the first owners in 1999, and has
    enjoyed various sailing adventures including circumnavigations of the British
    Isles and trips across the Channel. The boat was coded between 2010-2020, which
    has now lapsed. Minstrel is a relatively young classic boat, and has been kept
    in beautiful condition by her attentive owners. She has a lot to offer an
    enthusiastic sailing family and is sure to impress upon viewing. Currently
    ashore and available to view by appointment at Birdham Pool Marina.

    **History**


    Minstrel was conceived and built for a dream trip of a North Atlantic circuit.
    Designed by Alan Pape, the hull and deck were built on St Peter’s Quay in Totnes
    by Robin Feloy and Gubby Williams with the fit out and rigging completed at
    Blagdon’s Yard in Plymouth. She was launched on 26^^th^^ September 1991. After
    proving voyages between South West England and South West Ireland, she set out
    on the Atlantic circuit in August 1992 – across the Bay of Biscay, down the
    coasts of Spain and Portugal, and crossing to Bequia via the Canaries. After
    extensive Island Hopping via the Bahamas to the Florida coast, she followed the
    intra-coast waterway up the East coast of the USA, reaching Brooklin in Maine
    via New York in September 1993. She re-crossed the Atlantic in 1995 and after a
    period of chartering in Ireland in 1998, was sailing back to Devon for sale. The
    current owner purchased in 1999 and after cruising the English Channel and
    Brittany between 1999 and 2008, she underwent a major refit. In 2010 she
    completed a clockwise circuit of Great Britain via the Caledonian Canal. A
    further clockwise circuit was completed in 2013 visiting the Outer Hebrides,
    Orkney and Shetland.


    Major works have included a taller and stiffer mast with new standing rigging in
    2006, the new BETA engine in 2007 and the creation of the quarter berth and
    enlarged galley in 2009 with complete rewiring and new cushions/mattresses. Her
    sail wardrobe ahs been regularly updated and expanded.


    Minstrel was Category 2 MCS coded for 6 between 2010-2020, which has now lapsed
