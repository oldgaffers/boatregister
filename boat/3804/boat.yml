    Sailing History -

    Built in 1978 MK1 Cornish Crabber

    First ones built with GRP hull moulded from original chine shape which was a ply
    hull.

    *Kallisto* has sailed to South West Brittany, The Channel Isles, Southern
    Ireland, The Scilly Isles, The East Coast , Bristol Channel, The West Country,
    Solent and even the River Thames from Lechlade to Chatham Docks (without the
    mast)

    She was trailed to Falmouth from Dorchester for the 2021 Classics Race.

    Since Autumn 2021 *Kallisto* has not been in the water as Ray, my husband,
    passed away end of 2021. She has been kept under cover on the trailer used to
    tow her.

    There has been damage to the front where the anchor chain runs through as this
    was caused by a storm in Lulworth Cove.

    Ray kept her in mint condition and spent many hours maintaining her.

    She is the ideal size to sail solo, but large enough to accommodate another crew
    member.

    *Kallisto* comes on the Hayling Island trailer purchased new in 2006.

    Sold as seen she can be viewed on dry land in Dorset.
