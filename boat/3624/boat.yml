short_description: |-
  Home built Iain Oughtred Penny Fee design with an added jib and bowsprit as per
  the designer's suggestion
full_description: |-
  Built to satisfy a desire for a family dinghy, but not really used as such.
  Sailed on the Thames, the Solent and the Orwell. The rig gives lots of options
  and performs well in windy conditions with just jib and mizzen.
