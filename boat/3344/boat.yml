full_description: <p>&#39;Faith&#39; is a carefully researched re-creation of the
  local East Coast river/estuary small working boats known as bumkin or winkle brigs.
  Open, clinker-built, gaff rigged boats, they worked the oyster laying in the creeks,
  did a bit of fishing and carried heavy loads such as scram, shingle and the bigger
  smacks&#39; catches.</p>
