short_description: <p>Pied Piper of Burnham is a Bermudan Sloop designed by Alan Buchanan
  and built by Alan Platt in 1961</p>
full_description: "<p>Pied Piper of Burnham has been in the owner&#39;s family since\
  \ 1976 [2018]&nbsp;and was on the same mooring at Gosport Cruising Club until 2004\
  \ when she moved back to the East Coast. She is now sailed from the Royal Northumberland\
  \ Yacht Club at Blyth or the Royal Quays Marina in North Shields on the River Tyne.&nbsp;Modest\
  \ summer cruises over that time have taken her across the channel to Cherbourg and\
  \ Alderney as well as west as far as Dartmouth and Salcombe. Anchoring in Newton\
  \ River being a favourite on many a weekend. More recently she has cruised the north\
  \ east coat between&nbsp; Whitby and Eyemouth. For health reasons she is now only\
  \ day sailed.&nbsp;She has been a big part of the owners life since he was 8 years\
  \ old and he has been sailing her alone since his late teens. She was also the reason\
  \ he chose a career in ship design and shipbuilding. He lived onboard during his\
  \ formative years working at a Southampton shipyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is a King\
  \ Cole Class motor sailor (Sail No.1)&nbsp;and the only boat&nbsp;of that class\
  \ known to the owner. There is a reference to the class in the 1964 Bristows Book\
  \ of Yachts. There the&nbsp;builder is given&nbsp;as&nbsp;Kingcraft (Boatbuilders)\
  \ Ltd. and at&nbsp;a cost of&nbsp;&pound;3995. She is formally listed as being built\
  \ by Kingcraft but they do&nbsp;not appear in the list of builders in the back of\
  \ Lloyds Register of Yachts. Her&nbsp;owner, Dr Peter N.H.&nbsp;Wright BEng PhD\
  \ CEng MRINA,&nbsp;had the great privilege&nbsp;to&nbsp;corresponded&nbsp;with Alan\
  \ Buchanan as a fellow Naval Architect. This&nbsp;provided further detail about\
  \ her&nbsp;design but not about her builder. Extensive local research by Geoff Edwards&nbsp;from\
  \ Burnham Museum has resolved this&nbsp;question. It was discovered that the first\
  \ owner, Henry&nbsp;Town, commissioned her to be built by Alan F. Platt and Colin\
  \ Nightingale on some land he rented for the purpose at the back of Hadleigh Iron\
  \ Works. When she was completed she was taken by road round to Burnham and was launched\
  \ at Rice and Cole Ltd.&#39;s yard in 1961. She was the first boat Alan Platt built\
  \ after completing his apprenticeship and returning from National Service. Her owner\
  \ has spoken to Alan Platt. He particularly&nbsp;recalled&nbsp;the Kelvin engine&nbsp;and&nbsp;rowing&nbsp;out\
  \ to her mooring at Burnham to carry out maintenance over the first couple of seasons.&nbsp;As\
  \ well as being an estate agent in Burnham, Henry Town was also a director of a\
  \ cabinet making company called Kingcraft, hence the name he used for the builder\
  \ when registering her. This also&nbsp;explained&nbsp;his ability to source good\
  \ boatbuilding&nbsp;timber.&nbsp;He later diversified more formally&nbsp;into boatbuilding\
  \ under the name of Kingcraft (Boatbuilding) Ltd. He kept Pied Piper until 1964&nbsp;when\
  \ he ordered a&nbsp;Buchanan Saxon Class Sloop named&nbsp;Reina Christina.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Pied Piper still has her original Bergius Kelvin P4 diesel that produces&nbsp;20\
  \ SHP at 1200 RPM. It&nbsp;pushes her along very well and economically.&nbsp;It\
  \ was lifted out of the boat in the mid 1990&#39;s to renew the keel bolts beneath\
  \ it&nbsp;and the opportunity was taken to strip the engine down. It&nbsp;was found\
  \ pistons, valve stems and guides etc. were still within Kelvin&#39;s stated tolerances.\
  \ New rings and one new cylinder liner were fitted&nbsp;as well&nbsp;a&nbsp;Martec&nbsp;heat\
  \ exchanger. This&nbsp;was installed to stop further degradation to the seats of\
  \ the cylinder liner seals due to direct raw water cooling.&nbsp;The Kelvin stern&nbsp;gear,&nbsp;bronze\
  \ throttle and characteristic astern wheel&nbsp;are all&nbsp;original.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>There has been a life long commitment, through thick and thin, to keep the\
  \ boat up together and sailing. To this end she has been maintained very&nbsp;carefully\
  \ by the owner and his father&nbsp;during their&nbsp;long combined ownership. Keel\
  \ bolts, floor bolts and other fastenings have been replaced as needed. A length\
  \ of the sheer strake and cover board on the aft port quarter were replaced in 1990&rsquo;s\
  \ by the Maritime Workshop in Gosport.&nbsp;The only significant changes made were\
  \ to replace, out of necessity, the fore hatch, the Dorade boxes and toe rail soon\
  \ after she was&nbsp;bought by the father&nbsp;of the current owner in 1976.&nbsp;The\
  \ mast, boom and most deck fittings are original. The finish on the spars and all\
  \ the bright work has been gradually changed over to Coelan.&nbsp;When recently\
  \ stripping the bottom back to bare wood, for the first&nbsp;time since 1978, the&nbsp;planking,\
  \ stem, garboards, keelson and stern post were said to be&nbsp;as bright as when\
  \ she was built. The owner reports the&nbsp;bilges remain dry even when she is sailed\
  \ hard.</p>"
