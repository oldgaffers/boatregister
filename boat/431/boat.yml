  until the 1930s.
full_description: |-
  'ADC' was built by Aldous of Brightlingsea in 1895 for a local family. In 1897
  she was owned by William Joseph Barbrook and William Joseph Barbrook Jnr. of
  Tollesbury and sailed with the family fleet until the 1930s.


  She was to be called 'Ada', after a daughter of the family born in 1878, but her
  name was changed after the A and D were carved. ADC stands for Ada, Dick and
  Charlie, and she is reputed to have been the family's favourite boat, being
  renowned for her speed.


  She was sold out of fishing in 1967, and her owner joined the recently-formed
  East Coast OGA. Re-rigged in the 1980s, she was rebuilt 1997 - 2000 and
  relaunched at Pin Mill, River Orwell.


  Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to
  be in the 1970s, showing 'ADC' taking part in the Thames Oyster Smack Race from
  Gravesend to Billingsgate, and celebrating her victory at the finish line.
