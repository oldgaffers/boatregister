full_description: "<p>&#39;ADC&#39; was built by Aldous of Brightlingsea in 1895 for\
  \ a local family. In 1897 she was owned by William Joseph Barbrook and William Joseph\
  \ Barbrook Jnr. of Tollesbury and sailed with the family fleet until the 1930s.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She was to be called &#39;Ada&#39;, after a daughter of the family born\
  \ in 1878, but her name was changed after the A and D were carved. ADC stands for\
  \ Ada, Dick and Charlie, and she is reputed to have been the family&#39;s favourite\
  \ boat, being renowned for her speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sold out of fishing\
  \ in 1967, and her owner joined the recently-formed East Coast OGA. Re-rigged in\
  \ the 1980s, she was rebuilt 1997 - 2000 and relaunched at Pin Mill, River Orwell.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely\
  \ to be in the 1970s, showing &#39;ADC&#39; taking part in the Thames Oyster Smack\
  \ Race from Gravesend to Billingsgate, and celebrating her victory at the finish\
  \ line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\"\
