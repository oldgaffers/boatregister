short_description: <p>&#39;My Alice&#39; was built in the Kidby yard at Brightlingsea,
  1907. She is one of only two remaining Kidby smacks (&#39;Charlotte Ellen&#39; is
  the other). She is registered in Colchester Creek, hence&nbsp;CK348.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;My Alice&#39; is owned by Carole and Stephen Heppell, raced\
  \ with family, colleagues and long standing friends.&nbsp;She is based on the Heritage\
  \ Pontoon in Brightlingsea Harbour&nbsp;about 300 yards from where she was built\
  \ in 1907. She often winters at the St Katharine Docks next to the Tower of London,\
  \ but can mostly&nbsp;be seen racing on the East Coast, South Coast and, for the\
  \ odd regatta, in mainland Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;My Alice&#39; is one of the\
  \ UK&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/register/1965/my-alice\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">National Historic Fleet</a>. She is just on 70&#39; feet overall.\
  \ Downwind she is just on 70&#39; wide!&nbsp;Masthead is about 75&#39; up. She&#39;s\
  \ a little over 11.5 feet in beam, weighing in at 20 tons plus rig. She is number\
  \ 132 of Classic Boat magazine&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.classicboat.co.uk/articles/boat-tests/top-250-classic-boats/3/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">world&#39;s top 250 boats</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charles Kidby had\
  \ a good reputation for building very sound smacks and yachts. The lines of &#39;My\
  \ Alice&#39; reflect the design of someone who built both yachts and smacks. She\
  \ has a very elegant counter and plenty of &#39;bite&#39; to windward in her underwater\
  \ sections. Her racing skipper owner was probably an influence too. &#39;My Alice&#39;\
  \ was built for, and owned by Captain Fred Stokes of Tollesbury on the River Blackwater.\
  \ At the turn of the century the big expensive &quot;gentlemens&#39; yachts&quot;\
  \ that raced on the English South Coast were largely crewed by professional sailors\
  \ from Brightlingsea, Wivenhoe, Rowhedge and Tollesbury on the English East Coast\
  \ (a bit like all the grand prix yachts full of Kiwis today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fred\
  \ spent his summers racing as a rather successful skipper. As you are only supposed\
  \ to catch oysters when there is an R in the month in the northern hemisphere, racing\
  \ in May, June, July and August fitted rather well. In 1905 Mrs Turner Farley had\
  \ commissioned a racing yacht, &#39;Sonja&#39;, in the 52&#39; rating class and\
  \ she had gone to Nathanael Herreschoff with the commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not surprisingly,\
  \ with Fred skippering and Nat&#39;s design, &#39;Sonja&#39; had a string of successful\
  \ regattas around the UK, between 1905 and 1908 (<a href=\"http://www.heppell.net/sail/media/sonja.pdf\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">read this report of one</a>). She won hundreds of pounds of\
  \ prize money and Fred&#39;s share would have been maybe as much as &pound;100 per\
  \ season. This prize money, and the pro-skipper wage of around &pound;3 per week\
  \ gave Captain Fred Stokes enough money to have his own boat, &#39;My Alice&#39;,\
  \ commissioned at the Kidby yard. She was apparently his pride and joy.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>Although smacks by 1907 were contemplating and fitting engines, &#39;My Alice&#39;\
  \ owes more to the racing yacht shapes of the previous decade. Fred knew what he\
  \ wanted, a race boat and a smack!&nbsp;Writing in Classic Boat back in June 1997\
  \ John Leather commented:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>But &#39;My Alice&#39;\
  \ had all the sailing characteristics of 20 years before, with a hull well formed\
  \ for windward work, and a well rounded forefoot, which helped avoid damage to stowboat\
  \ gear when spratting. Her counter is narrow compared to many smacks of that size\
  \ which were slightly broader aft to assist when boarding a trawl or stowboat net.</em></p>\r\
  \n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So she was the best of two worlds, fishing and racing\
  \ and looking at the lines of Nat&#39;s race boats, you can see where the influence\
  \ in the Kidby&#39;s yard came from. The Kidby yard closed in 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>John Leather remembers &#39;My Alice&#39; motoring into Brightlingsea in 1946\
  \ under her big Lister diesel engine, shrimping and spratting in summer and winter,\
  \ but&nbsp;still spared the indignity of a wheelhouse or a wheel. Money was tight.&nbsp;</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1987 &#39;My Alice&#39; was damaged&nbsp;by a commercial ship in the\
  \ Roach and briefly sunk. She was brought ashore, and then to John Milgate&#39;s\
  \ yard at Pelham where she sat (no doubt dreaming of her earlier days of work and\
  \ regattas and fun).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she might have finished her days there, but\
  \ for the arrival of Jim Dines in 1993. Jim took her back to his yard in Maldon\
  \ with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tsrigging.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">its traditional\
  \ and classic rigging service</a>. Jim assembled a team around Brian Kennell, Sean\
  \ White and others and set to work on an extensive, expensive&nbsp;and deserved\
  \ rebuild of &#39;My Alice&#39;. She needed to be completely replanked, one plank\
  \ at a time, copying or saving what was there; her keels, sternpost, deadwoods,\
  \ keelson and stem were all rebuilt in massive West African opepe. Her sawn oak\
  \ frames were all restored or replaced, also in sawn oak. A new deck was fitted\
  \ using two layers of 3/4&quot; ply, glass covered. A compromise but it held her\
  \ all together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original deck layout was restored, with\
  \ small hatches and large open deck space. &#39;My Alice&#39; has had the original\
  \ scuttle hatch refitted, between the main hold hatch and the aft accommodation\
  \ hatch. This was used to shoot the catch into when at sea so as not to expose the\
  \ boat to the danger of having the main hatch opened and capable of being breached\
  \ by rough weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim managed to track down the original sail drawings\
  \ for her topsail (from Gowens on Mersea) and using photographs was able to be fairly\
  \ accurate about the proportions of her rig. Her main mast was replaced (it had\
  \ rotted at the foot) and her topmast was replaced too (it was broken in the Colne\
  \ Match).&nbsp;Their size needed revisiting with a little extra now added on her\
  \ mast and gaff getting the scale right too. She certainly balances very well, fingertip\
  \ steering, with her 22&#39; of Douglas fir bowsprit out in front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\
  \ rebuilding of &#39;My Alice&#39; took Jim&#39;s team&nbsp;fully nine years of\
  \ hard work. When Classic Boat magazine revisited her for the Maldon Regatta of\
  \ 2002 Jim would only say it had all cost more than &pound;120,000 because that\
  \ was when he stopped counting . . . at about half way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today of course\
  \ &#39;My Alice&#39; is back home in Brightlingsea. One of the current crew [2019]\
  \ is the great great great grandson of Charles Kidby and her interior has been refitted\
  \ by folk including the great great grandson! Her racing crew is around 11 people,\
  \ she is a big powerful smack.</p>"
