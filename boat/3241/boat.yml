short_description: |-
  'My Alice' was built in the Kidby yard at Brightlingsea, 1907. She is one of
  only two remaining Kidby smacks ('Charlotte Ellen' is the other). She is
  registered in Colchester Creek, hence CK348.
full_description: "'My Alice' is owned by Carole and Stephen Heppell, raced with family,\
  \ colleagues\nand long standing friends. She is based on the Heritage Pontoon in\
  \ Brightlingsea\nHarbour about 300 yards from where she was built in 1907. She often\
  \ winters at\nthe St Katharine Docks next to the Tower of London, but can mostly be\
  \ seen\nracing on the East Coast, South Coast and, for the odd regatta, in mainland\n\
  Europe.\n\n\n'My Alice' is one of the UK's [National Historic\nFleet](https://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/register/1965/my-alice).\
  \ She is\njust on 70' feet overall. Downwind she is just on 70' wide! Masthead is\
  \ about\n75' up. She's a little over 11.5 feet in beam, weighing in at 20 tons plus\
  \ rig.\nShe is number 132 of Classic Boat magazine's [world's top 250\nboats](https://www.classicboat.co.uk/articles/boat-tests/top-250-classic-boats/3/).\n\
  \n\nCharles Kidby had a good reputation for building very sound smacks and yachts.\n\
  The lines of 'My Alice' reflect the design of someone who built both yachts and\n\
  smacks. She has a very elegant counter and plenty of 'bite' to windward in her\n\
  underwater sections. Her racing skipper owner was probably an influence too. 'My\n\
  Alice' was built for, and owned by Captain Fred Stokes of Tollesbury on the\nRiver\
  \ Blackwater. At the turn of the century the big expensive \"gentlemens'\nyachts\"\
  \ that raced on the English South Coast were largely crewed by\nprofessional sailors\
  \ from Brightlingsea, Wivenhoe, Rowhedge and Tollesbury on\nthe English East Coast\
  \ (a bit like all the grand prix yachts full of Kiwis\ntoday).\n\n\nFred spent his\
  \ summers racing as a rather successful skipper. As you are only\nsupposed to catch\
  \ oysters when there is an R in the month in the northern\nhemisphere, racing in\
  \ May, June, July and August fitted rather well. In 1905 Mrs\nTurner Farley had\
  \ commissioned a racing yacht, 'Sonja', in the 52' rating class\nand she had gone\
  \ to Nathanael Herreschoff with the commission.\n\n\nNot surprisingly, with Fred\
  \ skippering and Nat's design, 'Sonja' had a string of\nsuccessful regattas around\
  \ the UK, between 1905 and 1908 ([read this report of\none](http://www.heppell.net/sail/media/sonja.pdf)).\
  \ She won hundreds of pounds\nof prize money and Fred's share would have been maybe\
  \ as much as £100 per\nseason. This prize money, and the pro-skipper wage of around\
  \ £3 per week gave\nCaptain Fred Stokes enough money to have his own boat, 'My Alice',\
  \ commissioned\nat the Kidby yard. She was apparently his pride and joy.\n\n\nAlthough\
  \ smacks by 1907 were contemplating and fitting engines, 'My Alice' owes\nmore to\
  \ the racing yacht shapes of the previous decade. Fred knew what he\nwanted, a race\
  \ boat and a smack! Writing in Classic Boat back in June 1997 John\nLeather commented:\n\
  \n\n\n> \n> *But 'My Alice' had all the sailing characteristics of 20 years before,\
  \ with a\n> hull well formed for windward work, and a well rounded forefoot, which\
  \ helped\n> avoid damage to stowboat gear when spratting. Her counter is narrow\
  \ compared to\n> many smacks of that size which were slightly broader aft to assist\
  \ when boarding\n> a trawl or stowboat net.*\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSo she was the best\
  \ of two worlds, fishing and racing and looking at the lines\nof Nat's race boats,\
  \ you can see where the influence in the Kidby's yard came\nfrom. The Kidby yard\
  \ closed in 1939.\n\n\nJohn Leather remembers 'My Alice' motoring into Brightlingsea\
  \ in 1946 under her\nbig Lister diesel engine, shrimping and spratting in summer\
  \ and winter,\nbut still spared the indignity of a wheelhouse or a wheel. Money\
  \ was tight. \n\n\nIn 1987 'My Alice' was damaged by a commercial ship in the Roach\
  \ and briefly\nsunk. She was brought ashore, and then to John Milgate's yard at\
  \ Pelham where\nshe sat (no doubt dreaming of her earlier days of work and regattas\
  \ and fun).\n\n\nAnd she might have finished her days there, but for the arrival\
  \ of Jim Dines in\n1993. Jim took her back to his yard in Maldon with [its traditional\
  \ and classic\nrigging service](http://www.tsrigging.co.uk/). Jim assembled a team\
  \ around Brian\nKennell, Sean White and others and set to work on an extensive,\
  \ expensive and\ndeserved rebuild of 'My Alice'. She needed to be completely replanked,\
  \ one plank\nat a time, copying or saving what was there; her keels, sternpost,\
  \ deadwoods,\nkeelson and stem were all rebuilt in massive West African opepe. Her\
  \ sawn oak\nframes were all restored or replaced, also in sawn oak. A new deck was\
  \ fitted\nusing two layers of 3/4\" ply, glass covered. A compromise but it held\
  \ her all\ntogether. \n\n\nThe original deck layout was restored, with small hatches\
  \ and large open deck\nspace. 'My Alice' has had the original scuttle hatch refitted,\
  \ between the main\nhold hatch and the aft accommodation hatch. This was used to\
  \ shoot the catch\ninto when at sea so as not to expose the boat to the danger of\
  \ having the main\nhatch opened and capable of being breached by rough weather.\n\
  \n\nJim managed to track down the original sail drawings for her topsail (from\n\
  Gowens on Mersea) and using photographs was able to be fairly accurate about the\n\
  proportions of her rig. Her main mast was replaced (it had rotted at the foot)\n\
  and her topmast was replaced too (it was broken in the Colne Match). Their size\n\
  needed revisiting with a little extra now added on her mast and gaff getting the\n\
  scale right too. She certainly balances very well, fingertip steering, with her\n\
  22' of Douglas fir bowsprit out in front.\n\n\nThe rebuilding of 'My Alice' took\
  \ Jim's team fully nine years of hard work. When\nClassic Boat magazine revisited\
  \ her for the Maldon Regatta of 2002 Jim would\nonly say it had all cost more than\
  \ £120,000 because that was when he stopped\ncounting . . . at about half way.\n\
  \n\nToday of course 'My Alice' is back home in Brightlingsea. One of the current\n\
  crew [2019] is the great great great grandson of Charles Kidby and her interior\n\
  has been refitted by folk including the great great grandson! Her racing crew is\n\
  around 11 people, she is a big powerful smack."
