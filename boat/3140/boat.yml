full_description: "<p>&#39;Pathfinder 3&#39; is a modern interpretation of the traditional\
  \ canoe yawl designed for the home builder. At 16 feet (5.0m) in length and a hull\
  \ weight of only 95kg she easily passes the &lsquo;able to be transported within\
  \ a traditional railway guards-van&rsquo; test for the genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\
  \ craft utilises &lsquo;stitch and tape&rsquo; construction and a unique &lsquo;single\
  \ plank&rsquo; per side build concept which avoids traditional framing and planking.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>&#39;Pathfinder 3&#39; was built in Ullapool by Chris Perkins in a little\
  \ under 3 months and launched in 2011 at the Portsoy Traditional Boat Festival.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Originally designed for raids (and able to sport two banks of oars), the\
  \ craft has proved an effective and quick &lsquo;all-rounder&rsquo; acquitting herself\
  \ well at OGA rallies and other events for traditional craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fyne\
  \ Boat Kits of Cumbria market the 14&rsquo; 6&rdquo; version as a kit, details of\
  \ which <a href=\"http://www.fyneboatkits.co.uk/kits/sailing/pathfinder/\" target=\"\
