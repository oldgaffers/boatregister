full_description: |-
  Owned by the Morecambe Bay Prawner Trust, Spray is one of the oldest Morecambe
  Bay Prawners still in existence. She was built by Crossfield's of Arnside in
  1896. Crossfield's were leading builders of Morecambe Bay Prawners, yachts and
  other boats including Arthur Ransome's Swallow from the 1840s to 1940s. Spray
  was named after Joshua Slocum's boat which set off around the world in 1895.

  Morecambe Bay Prawners (also known as Lancashire Nobbies) were fast,
  sail-powered boats designed to cope with the shallow waters of the North West
  Coast. There were large fleets at Morecambe, Fleetwood, Southport, Merseyside
  and Annan. The development of the railways enable their catch to be brought to
  growing industrial areas of Lancashire. The boats had a central open cockpit
  with the decks at waist height used as a working area.

  **History**

  **Morecambe 1896 - 1900**

  Spray was built in 1896 by William Crossfield in Arnside for John Gardner of 1
  Main Street Morecambe. The Gardners were a were a well established fishing
  family with several members owning boats. Her fishing boat number was LR 102.

  At the turn of the nineteenth century Morecambe was booming with holidaymakers
  coming from the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire for the annual Wakes
  Holidays. New attractions included the Winter Gardens and the West End Pier. The
  resort had a fleet of around 100 prawners many of them built by Crossfields in
  Arnside.

  Spray would have had an open cockpit when first built and for most of her
  working life.

  **Solway Firth 1900 - 1920**

  On the 31st December 1900 she was sold to Edward Waters of Silloth on the Solway
  Firth and re-registered as CL4 a Carlisle fishing boat number. Between 1914 and
  1916 Spray was based at Annan on the other side of the Solway in Scotland and
  registered as BA40 (Ballantrae). Ballantrae is a small harbour north of
  Stranraer. Ballantrae was used as the fishing registration port for a wide area
  of Southern Scotland. In 1916 she returned to Silloth and was re-registered as
  CL 4.

  **Morecambe 1920 - 1936**

  In 1920 Spray returned to Morecambe. Between 1920 until 1925 she was used as a
  yacht by James Baxter, a fish merchant of Morecambe. Spray was raced in the
  Morecambe Regatta of 23rd September 1921. James Baxter and Sons are the longest
  established producers of Morecambe Bay Potted Shrimps. They have been in
  business since 1880.

  Spray was sold on 15th December 1925 to Wilfred Woodhouse of 27 Cross Street,
  Morecambe. The Woodhouses were another Morecambe fishing family. Wilfred and his
  son set a Morecambe record by catching 120 stone of prime plaice at the top end
  of the Bay.

  It is not known when Spray first had an engine fitted, though engines started to
  be used on Morecambe based boats from 1925 onwards.

  **Barrow 1938 - 1958**

  Spray was brought by Hugh Molineaux of Barrow and registered as BW3. Hugh
  restored Spray and continued to use her for fishing,

  The first know photo of Spray was taken on the hard at Barrow in June 1944, when
  she was owned by Bill Rawlinson. Alec Rawlinson is on the boat with him. Bill
  took the engine out of Spray and sold her to Tom Hesketh who kept her on the
  beach at Barrow. By 1950 she was already an old boat.

  **Dee Estuary 1958 - 1978**

  Spray was inherited by James, Archibald and Roy Hunter of Hoylake from their
  uncle in Barrow. Hoylake is a seaside town at the mouth of the Dee Estuary on
  the Wirral peninsula. The town was originally a fishing village. To bring her
  back from Barrow she had to be dug out of the mud. Spray was registered at
  Liverpool with the number LL33. She was fitted with a petrol paraffin pocket
  valve engine.

  She was sold on 5th August 1966 for £210 to Henry Evans, a fisherman of Mostyn
  Avenue, Heswall, and nephew to Dick Evans, owner of Heswall Boatyard. The
  Boatyard brought and sold boats, but focused mainly on storage and repair, only
  occasionally building new boats. On 23rd November 1966 the sale to a Prestatyn
  owner was cancelled due to breach of contract.

  Spray was eventually brought by Harold Hopper of Leasowe on the north coast of
  the Wirral for £250 (about £4600 in 2026 prices) on 4th March 1968, when she
  would have 72 well past pension age. She was fitted with a 3 cylinder Lister
  engine, Her fishing registration was cancelled in October 1973, effectively
  bringing her 77 year fishing career to an end.

  She was brought by John Housley of Hoylake from an advertisement in Fishing
  News. The Housleys were a well established fishing family. By the 1970s many
  fishermen found it difficult to make a living from fishing alone with changing
  eating and shopping habits. Many took jobs in other industries, but continued to
  own a boat. If things changed the boat could always be re-registered for
  fishing. By this time Spray had a wheelhouse.

  Spray was brought in 1978 by Colin Gilmore. She was lying ashore at Hoylake
  Green without engine, mast or running rigging. Colin removed Spray to Brunswick
  Dock, which is home to Liverpool Marina and fitted her with a mast removed from
  Moonlight a Nobby that had been cut up. Colin brought Spray for private use
  rather than for fishing.

  From the late 70s there was an increased interest in Morecambe Bay Prawners or
  Nobbies with enthusiasts buying old boats, such as Spray to keep the heritage
  alive. Several Nobbies were converted to yachts enabling them to make longer
  journeys. The first Liverpool Nobby Race was run in 1981 for the coveted Prawn
  Trophy with the Nobby Owners Association set up in 1987.

  **Maryport 1984 - 1987**

  In 1984 Spray was brought by Mr. Dickson of Maryport for £2,000 (£7000 in 2026
  prices), again for private use. She was delivered to Barrow, from where Mr
  Dickson sailed Spray to Maryport

  **Liverpool 1987 - 2024 Tom Middlebrook**

  Spray was bought in 1987 by Tom Middlebrook, a Liverpool  Insurance Broker and
  later Secretary of the Nobby Owners Association and North West Secretary of the
  OGA.

  Tom completely restored Spray over a period of three years refitting her with
  her current layout. Tom cruised and raced Spray extensively keeping her at
  Liverpool Marina in Brunswick Dock. Under his ownership Spray was a regular
  competitor in the Liverpool and Conway Nobby Races, winning many trophies. Spray
  regularly appeared at the Peel Traditional Boat Festival on the Isle of Man. Tom
  cruised her to North Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Cumbrian
  Coast and the Isle of Man. Spray featured in the BBC 2017 Britain Afloat TV
  programme about Morecambe Bay Prawners.

  Tom's ownership of Spray in many ways parallels the redevelopment of the
  Liverpool Waterfront. In the early 80s Liverpool was at a low point with the
  Toxeth Riots in 1981 and unemployment at 20%. Albert Dock was redeveloped from
  the mid 1980s with the Maritime Museum opening in 1984. The area round Brunswick
  Dock and Liverpool Marina was redeveloped as housing in the early 2000s.

  **Morecambe Bay Prawner Trust 2024 onwards**

  Spray was brought by the Morecambe Bay Prawner Trust in February 2024 for
  £10,000 and moved to Glasson Marina south of Lancaster. She was relaunched at
  the end of July 2025 after a programme work by volunteers aided by Matthew Foot
  of Bay Boatworks. Work included repairs to the hull in the bow area with several
  planks being replaced, a new bowsprit and repainting.

  It is planned to keep her at Glasson in the winter taking her to Morecambe in
  the summer mooring her close to the Stone Jetty and proposed Eden Centre as a
  reminder of Morecambe's fishing and maritime heritage.
