  SPRAY (1896) is one of the oldest Morecambe Bay Prawners still in existence..
  She was built by Crossfields of Arnside, in 1896.Crossfields were leading
  builder of Morecambe Prawners, yachts and other boats including Arthur Ransome's
  Swallow from 1840s to 1940s. Spray may have been named after Joshua Slocum's
  boat which set off round the World in 1895

  Morecambe Bay Prawners (also known as Lancashire Nobbies) were fast sailed
  powered boats designed to cope with the shallow waters of the North West Coast.
  There were large fleets at Morecambe, Fleetwood, Southport, Merseyside and
  Annan. The development of the railways enable their catch to be brought to
  growing industrial areas of Lancashire.

  Spray was built for John Gardner of 1 Main Street Morecambe who owned her until
  at least 1898. Between 1900 and 1920 she was based on the Solway, firstly at
  Silloth, then Annan. 

  Between 1920 until 1925 she was used as a yacht by James Baxter, a fish merchant
  of Morecambe. Raced in the Morecambe Regatta of 23rd September 1921 coming first
  in the race for Fishing Boats between 27 and 33 feet long. James Baxter and Sons
  are the longest established producers of Morecambe Bay Potted Shrimps. They have
  been in business since 1880.

  Sold on 15th December 1925 to Wilfred Woodhouse of 27 Cross Street, Morecambe,
  who with his son got one hundred and twenty stone of big plaice out of the top
  end of the bay, a Morecambe record.

  Between 1958 and 1973 she was registered at Liverpool. She was owned by the
  Evans family of Heswall in the Wirral Peninsular who fished the Dee Estuary
  before returning to Maryport.

  She was then bought in 1987 by Tom Middlebrook, a Liverpool Insurance Broker and
  later Secretary of the Nobby Owners Association and North West Secretary of the
  OGA. The Nobby Owners Association was set in 1897 by a group of enthusiast in
  Liverpool to encourage the restoration of Morecambe Bay Prawners (or Nobbies).
  The Association organised regular Nobby races.

  Tom completely restored Spray over a period of three years. Tom cruised and
  raced Spray extensively keeping her at Liverpool. Under his ownership Spray was
  a regular competitor in the Liverpool and Conway Nobby Races, winning many
  trophies. Spray regularly appeared at the Peel Traditional Boat Festival on the
  Isle of Man. Tom cruised her to North Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland,
  Scotland, the Cumbrian Coast and the Isle of Man. Spray featured in the BBC 2017
  Britain Afloat TV programme about Morecambe Bay Prawners.
