  Nick Henshall commisioned the hull build after recovering from a motorcycle
  accident and having to give up fishing. He fitted her out over 5 years.


  Her displacement of 3.5 tonnes is achieved partly through her internal ballast
  of rubber encased lead ingots adding 1.5 tonnes. Heavily laid up and with
  beaching legs she is ideally suited to the challenging West Country waters and
  drying harbours.


  When new she was featured in the Sept/Oct 2008 Water Craft Magazine. Named
  Jessie & Zac after Nick's children in the tradition of many old West Country
  fishing boats, she received an enthusiastic write up and photographs by the
  magazine and a warm welcome by the local dolphins!


  She was for sale in 2009-10 and sold to Neyland, South Wales. The next owner saw
  her there in in a neglected state in April 2019 and spent 3 months restoring
  her, before relaunching in July 2019.


  She was expected to require some further input for solo sailing for which UK
  Rigging Penryn and a friend of the owner advised.


  She had a full refit in 2021, with a new inboard Sole 17hp Mini Compact engine,
  all new water cooled stern tube and pumps, new internal electronics and a new
  raised coachroof.
