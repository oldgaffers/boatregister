full_description: "<p>9Nick Henshall commisioned the hull build after recovering from\
  \ a motorcycle accident and having to give up fishing. He fitted her out over 5\
  \ years. She was for sale in 2009-10 and sold to Neyland, South Wales. The current\
  \ owner saw her there in in a neglected state in April 2019 and spent 3 months restoring\
  \ her, before relaunching in July 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;She will require some\
  \ further input for solo sailing for which UK Rigging Penryn and a friend will advise</p>"
