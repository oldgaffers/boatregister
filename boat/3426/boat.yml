short_description: '*Oran na Mara* is a powerful little cutter of the Sea Scamp class'
full_description: "Nick Henshall commisioned the hull build after recovering from
  a motorcycle\naccident and having to give up fishing. He fitted her out over 5 years.\n
  \n\nHer displacement of 3.5 tonnes is achieved partly through her internal ballast\n
  of rubber encased lead ingots adding 1.5 tonnes. Heavily laid up and with\nbeaching
  legs she is ideally suited to the challenging West Country waters and\ndrying harbours.\n
  \n\nWhen new she was featured in the Sept/Oct 2008 Water Craft Magazine. Named\n
  Jessie & Zac after Nick's children in the tradition of many old West Country\nfishing
  boats, she received an enthusiastic write up and photographs by the\nmagazine and
  a warm welcome by the local dolphins!\n\n\nShe was for sale in 2009-10 and sold
  to Neyland, South Wales. The next owner saw\nher there in in a neglected state in
  April 2019 and spent 3 months restoring\nher, before relaunching in July 2019.\n
  \n\nShe was expected to require some further input for solo sailing for which UK\n
  Rigging Penryn and a friend of the owner advised.\n\n\nShe had a full refit in 2021,
  with a new inboard Sole 17hp Mini Compact engine,\nall new water cooled stern tube
  and pumps, new internal electronics and a new\nraised coachroof."
