full_description: |+
  Nick Henshall commisioned the hull build after recovering from
  a motorcycle accident and having to give up fishing. He fitted her out over 5
  years. 
  
  Her displacement of 3.5 tonnes is achieved partly through her internal ballast of rubber
  encased lead ingots adding 1.5 tonnes. Heavily laid up and with beaching legs she is ideally suited
  to the challenging West Country waters and drying harbours.

  When new she was featured in the Sept/Oct 2008 Water Craft Magazine.
  Named Jessie & Zac after Nick's children in the tradition of many old West Country fishing boats,
  she received an enthusiastic write up and photographs by the magazine and a warm welcome by the
  local dolphins!
  
  She was for sale in 2009-10 and sold to Neyland, South Wales. The next
  owner saw her there in in a neglected state in April 2019 and spent 3 months restoring
  her, before relaunching in July 2019.
  
  She was expected to require some further input for solo sailing for which UK Rigging Penryn and a friend of the
  owner advised.

  She had a full refit in 2021, with a new inboard Sole 17hp Mini Compact engine,
  all new water cooled stern tube and pumps, new internal electronics and a new raised coachroof.

    Here we have my Sea Scamp Gaff Rig, *Oran Na Mara*.
    I'm reluctantly selling her due to a change in my health.

    She was commissioned in 2005 and purchased by myself in 2021.

    She was professionally buffed and polished at the beginning of last season 
    also had a full refit, starting with a new inboard Sole 17hp Mini Compact engine,
    with all new water cooled stern tube and pumps, she has all new internal electronics as well as
    an all new raised coach house, that has been professionally constructed in hard wood, this has gives
    it plenty of extra head room in the cabin.

    A truly great opportunity to own a one of a kind boat, all ready to for her next adventure.

    Lying at Penzance, Cornwall.
