full_description: "<p><em>Betty</em> was built in 1913 for Sam Strang of Glasgow,\
  \ as an auxiliary yacht. Although built for an engine from the start her propellor\
  \ was offset rather than on the centre line. In&nbsp;1938 her 2 cylinder petrol\
  \ engine was replaced with a more powerful 4 cylinder model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her 6th\
  \ owner had her altered from a yawl to a cutter rig in 1954, and she was given a\
  \ RORC rating of 20.81ft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>in 1959 she left her home waters and was\
  \ sold to Bristol, where she remained until she disappeared from the Lloyds register\
  \ of yachts in 1969. At this point she was still a&nbsp;cutter, but OGA records\
  \ state that this was the year she&nbsp;was returned to yawl rig</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
