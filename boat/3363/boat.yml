  sales_text: '<p><span class="c0">A pretty cruising yacht in the traditional style.
    &nbsp;With her renowned Norfolk Boatyard high quality build that combines modern
    fittings and traditional materials, Moonshine is a superb small yacht with more
    volume than you would expect for the 25ft length. With a shallow draft long keel,
    a high peaked gaff, and an easily operated and unobtrusive centreplate, she has
    impressive performance to windward.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Moonshine has
    been with her current owners since 2010 and has been well maintained, including
    having the engine professionally removed and reconditioned (2015), the addition
    of a pushpit with boarding ladder deployable from the water, and the fitting of
    beaching legs to increase cruising grounds and access to drying harbours.</span></p><p>Full
