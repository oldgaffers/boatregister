full_description: <p>Iseult is a classic example of the &#39;no-expense-spared&#39;
  cruising yacht &#39;out-and-out, go-anywhere&#39;. The counter and mizzen were added
  in 1927 converting her into a 42 ft. yawl. She entered the 1975 Fastnet Race but
  did not finish. She has probably entered more Solent Old Gaffers races than any
  other boat.</p>
