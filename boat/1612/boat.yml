full_description: "<p><em>Blue Jacket</em> appears in Lloyd\u2019s in about 1920 with\
  \ the ex-name \u2018Helen\u2019 &nbsp;recorded. In the 1930\u2019s she was purchased\
  \ by Uffa Fox for his publisher &nbsp;and was recorded in Fox\u2019s book \u2018\
  Thoughts on Yachts and Yachting\u2019 of 1938 &nbsp;in which there is a chapter\
