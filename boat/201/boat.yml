  \ for the Soady family and converted into a yacht in 1937 at Uphams&nbsp;yard in\
  \ Brixham. From 1960-1989 she was owned by Brigadier John Glennie, who sailed her\
  \ all around Europe. She was then substantially rebuilt in the early 1990s by Barry\
  \ Jobson and Jackie Gillespie, who sailed her to the Caribbean and back and took\
  \ part in many classic regattas. Her current owners are Paul and Sue Eedle.<br />\r\
