full_description: "<p><em>Margaret Ann</em> (sometimes in the past referred to as\
  \ <em>Margret Ann</em>) was &nbsp;built by David Hillyard in Littlehampton in 1939.\
  \ Before we owned her &nbsp;the cabin top had been widened to give better sitting\
  \ space below, a &nbsp;bowsprit had been added so she could be sailed as a cutter\
  \ or a sloop &nbsp;with her large jib from the bowsprit end, her iron internal ballast\
  \ had &nbsp;been changed for lead and her original Brit petrol engine changed for\
  \ a Yanmar GM10. When we bought <em>Margret Ann</em> in January (some years ago)she\
  \ had a berth at Shamrock Quay on the Itchen. The fees had been paid up to the March\
  \ so we sailed her from there most weekends until March. We thoroughly enjoyed it\
  \ in spite of the cold (we had a Tilley lamp which kept us warm in the evenings\
  \ and slept with two sleeping bags each and woolly hats).</p>\n<p>Wethen found rot\
  \ in the cabin top so had to start doing her up. We had sold a previous boat in\
  \ the meantime but unfortunately bought yet another one (built in 1910) which we\
  \ are still &nbsp;doing up. We're afraid that as a result <em>Margaret </em>Ann\
  \ has been neglected for a number of years so really needs a new owner to finish\
  \ the work so she can go sailing again.</p>\n<p>We completely removed the cabin\
  \ and deck, stripped and repainted the &nbsp;inside, repaired several timbers by\
  \ scarfing in new pieces, fitted two new deck beams, new half beams and carlins,\
  \ new hanging and quarter &nbsp;knees and laid a new tongue-and-groove pitch pine\
  \ deck, to be covered in &nbsp;canvas.We\u2019ve also replaced the top of the transom\
  \ and the top edge of the sheer strake and fitted a new samson post. We haven\u2019\
  t used any laminated timber, epoxy or plywood.All the pieces have been well painted\
  \ and luted with white lead paste before assembly, so other than having silicon\
  \ bronze screws where Hillyard's had used galvanised nails she's been redone in\
  \ the way she was built.</p>\n<p>Most if not all of the cockpit and cabin wood work\
  \ should be able to be &nbsp;refurbished and used again. She still has all her original\
  \ fittings for &nbsp;deck, cockpit etc. together with new replacements for some\
  \ of them. The &nbsp;four portlights have been refurbished. She has an imitation\
  \ CQR and a fisherman anchor and chain cable. The major work to be carried out is\
  \ the re-construction of the coachhouse and cockpit coamings and coachhouse deck\
  \ (the beams for this could be reused). She comes complete with the timber (mahogany\
  \ for the coamings and pitch pine for the cabin deck) to do this.</p>"
