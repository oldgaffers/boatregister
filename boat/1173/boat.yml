short_description: Margaret Ann is a Hillyard 2 1/2 tonner built in 1939
full_description: |-
  *Margaret Ann* (sometimes in the past referred to as *Margret Ann*) was  built
  by David Hillyard in Littlehampton in 1939. Before we owned her  the cabin top
  had been widened to give better sitting space below, a  bowsprit had been added
  so she could be sailed as a cutter or a sloop  with her large jib from the
  bowsprit end, her iron internal ballast had  been changed for lead and her
  original Brit petrol engine changed for a Yanmar GM10. When we bought *Margret
  Ann* in January (some years ago)she had a berth at Shamrock Quay on the Itchen.
  The fees had been paid up to the March so we sailed her from there most weekends
  until March. We thoroughly enjoyed it in spite of the cold (we had a Tilley lamp
  which kept us warm in the evenings and slept with two sleeping bags each and
  woolly hats).


  We then found rot in the cabin top so had to start doing her up. We had sold a
  previous boat in the meantime but unfortunately bought yet another one (built in
  1910) which we are still  doing up. We're afraid that as a result *Margaret* Ann
  has been neglected for a number of years so really needs a new owner to finish
  the work so she can go sailing again.


  We completely removed the cabin and deck, stripped and repainted the  inside,
  repaired several timbers by scarfing in new pieces, fitted two new deck beams,
  new half beams and carlins, new hanging and quarter  knees and laid a new
  tongue-and-groove pitch pine deck, to be covered in  canvas.We’ve also replaced
  the top of the transom and the top edge of the sheer strake and fitted a new
  samson post. We haven’t used any laminated timber, epoxy or plywood.All the
  pieces have been well painted and luted with white lead paste before assembly,
  so other than having silicon bronze screws where Hillyard's had used galvanised
  nails she's been redone in the way she was built.


  Most if not all of the cockpit and cabin wood work should be able to be
  refurbished and used again. She still has all her original fittings for  deck,
  cockpit etc. together with new replacements for some of them. The  four
  portlights have been refurbished. She has an imitation CQR and a fisherman
  anchor and chain cable. The major work to be carried out is the re-construction
  of the coachhouse and cockpit coamings and coachhouse deck (the beams for this
  could be reused). She comes complete with the timber (mahogany for the coamings
  and pitch pine for the cabin deck) to do this.
