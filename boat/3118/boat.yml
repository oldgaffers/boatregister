short_description: "<p>Built in 2003, Molly is a modern replica of a New Bedford whaleboat\
  \ designed by Charles Beetle.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"
full_description: "<p>Used by the Henley Whalers, a leading sail-and-oar group based\
  \ at Henley on Thames. Molly&#39;s rig has been reduced from the original to facilitate\
  \ towing and up to ten oars rather than the traditional five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Molly\
  \ remains unballasted, thus necessitating a large crew under sail. She is regularly\
  \ trailed to events across Europe including Venice, Netherlands, Morbian, Douarnenez,\
  \ Milford Haven, Scotland&#39;s Great Glen, Ireland and the Solent.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>She has made appearances in The Great River Race, the Vogalonga and the Eddystone\
  \ Challenge. In 2012 she was rowed in the Queen&#39;s Diamond Jubilee Pageant and\
  \ the Olympic Torch Relay.</p>"
