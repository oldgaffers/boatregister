full_description: For sale Log Sept 2001.  Was built with a transom stern. Luke Powell
  restored her in France about 15 years ago and added the counter stern. Her owner
  Martyn has given her a new deck, amongst many other improvements, during a 4-year
  refit.  Martyn tells me that the boat is quite powerful enough under sail to terrify
  him!
