full_description: |-
  Kelpie II was built on the lines of a J Pain Clark designed yacht called Rani
  IV, one of a series of Rani yachts and canoes by this designer. She was built in
  a purpose built shed in Lewisham, South London, by the owner of a joinery
  business called Herbert E Kennard and launched, from a timber cart, at Greenwich
  on Saturday 28t June 1902. She cost £76-2-7d to build, which for that time was a
  great deal of money for a yacht of this size.


  26 ft.LOA 6 ft. 6" beam and 3 ft. 9" draft, Kelpie II is a canoe yacht, gaff
  sloop rig, with designed displacement of 4000lbs. She has a plate and bulb keel
  with semi balanced spade rudder. The boat was advanced for her time featuring
  roller reefing on both main and jib, also all control lines were bought back to
  the cockpit, and of course there is the keel. Fin and bulb keels were not that
  uncommon on racing keelboats but on a yacht it was a bit unusual and, although
  the plate is new owner, Rik Graham, was very careful when replacing it to
  maintain the geometry of the original.


  The week after Kelpie was launched she started her career cruising the East
  Coast, from a base at Erith Yacht Club until 1973 but then from Pin Mill. Whilst
  based at Erith she had a very succesful racing career, particularly in the hands
  of her builder who helmed her until he was in his 80s. Of course time marches on
  and H E eventually passed Kelpie II to his son Dave who brought her to Pin Mill.


  Dave seems to have used Kelpie II mostly as a day sailer, with the occasional
  race, and sailed with a Barry Page who bought her in 1989 when Dave, in his
  turn, got too old to use her. Barry did some work on the boat replacing one
  garboard and having the decks plywood and epoxy sheathed but again day sailing,
  keeping her going none the less.


  At about the time that Barry was thinking that maintenance was getting to much
  for him Rik came onto the scene and became her latest owner in 2004. Four owners
  in 107 years and never rebuilt, not a bad record.

  sales_text: "Kelpie 2 is a cruiser racer built in 1902.\n\nH E Kennard, the first\
    \ owner/builder,\nwanted a boat to cruise the East Coast from his base at Erith\
    \ and race at club\nlevel. His choice of a design by J Pain Clark resulted in\
    \ a fine, pretty, boat\nthat has stood the test of time. Kelpie is red pine on\
    \ oak ribs, pitch pine and\noak centerline with a steel plate keel and lead ballast.\n\
    \nKelpie is the only extant example of a plate and bulb keel Victorian yacht.\n\
    \n26’ LOD by 6’ 6” beam 3’ 9” draft and only weighing 2 tons she is, like most\
    \ Pain Clark yachts, a\n flier. With a gaff sloop rig, roller reefed on both sails,\
    \ she is also light\n and easily sailed single handed.\n \n Although built for\
    \ cruising her accommodation,\n 2 berths and a small galley with a 2 burner spirit\
    \ stove, is by modern standards\n spartan. Auxiliary power is a 2.5 Hp outboard.\
    \ She has a full inventory of all you\n need to sail safely and comfortably.\n\
    \ \n Kelpie 2 has undergone a comprehensive\n rolling restoration over her currentnowners\
    \ stewardship and is ready for whatever\n a new owner wants from her. She is a\
    \ very rewarding boat to sail and surprisingly\n forgiving for a boat so well\
    \ canvased.\n \n Weatherly and light, Kelpie is easily\n sailed single handed.\
    \ The greatest testament to this lovely boat’s quality\n is that she has had only\
    \ 4 owners since she was built. To quote Yachting Monthly\n in 1970: “handy, fast\
    \ and tight, what more could you want?”\n\n Lying, Pin Mill, Suffolk."
