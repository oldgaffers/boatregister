full_description: "<p>Kelpie II was built on the lines of a J Pain Clark designed\
  \ yacht called Rani IV, one of a series of Rani yachts and canoes by this designer.\
  \ She was built in a purpose built shed in Lewisham, South London, by the owner\
  \ of a joinery business called Herbert E Kennard and launched, from a timber cart,\
  \ at Greenwich on Saturday 28t June 1902. She cost &pound;76-2-7d to build, which\
  \ for that time was a great deal of money for a yacht of this size.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>26 ft.LOA 6 ft. 6&quot; beam and 3 ft. 9&quot; draft, Kelpie II is a canoe yacht,\
  \ gaff sloop rig, with designed displacement of 4000lbs. She has a plate and bulb\
  \ keel with semi balanced spade rudder. The boat was advanced for her time featuring\
  \ roller reefing on both main and jib, also all control lines were bought back to\
  \ the cockpit, and of course there is the keel. Fin and bulb keels were not that\
  \ uncommon on racing keelboats but on a yacht it was a bit unusual and, although\
  \ the plate is new owner, Rik Graham, was very careful when replacing it to maintain\
  \ the geometry of the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The week after Kelpie was launched\
  \ she started her career cruising the East Coast, from a base at Erith Yacht Club\
  \ until 1973 but then from Pin Mill. Whilst based at Erith she had a very succesful\
  \ racing career, particularly in the hands of her builder who helmed her until he\
  \ was in his 80s. Of course time marches on and H E eventually passed Kelpie II\
  \ to his son Dave who brought her to Pin Mill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dave seems to have\
  \ used Kelpie II mostly as a day sailer, with the ocasional race, and sailed with\
  \ a Barry Page who bought her in 1989 when Dave, in his turn, got too old to use\
  \ her. Barry did some work on the boat replacing one garboard and having the decks\
  \ plywood and epoxy sheathed but again day sailing, keeping her going none the less.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>At about the time that Barry was thinking that maintenance was getting\
  \ to much for him Rik came onto the scene and became her latest owner in 2004. Four\
  \ owners in 107 years and never rebuilt, not a bad record.</p>"
