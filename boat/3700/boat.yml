name: Bluebelle
oga_no: 3700
rig_type: Single Sail
mainsail_type: balanced_lug
short_description: <p>Blue-hulled smacks boat which sits like a swan on the water.</p>
full_description: <p>She was built by Ron Hall from a mould taken from a wooden clinker
  dinghy by Alf Last of Maldon. Bluebelle has the same hull shape as the Brian Kennell
  smacks boat but has a heavier GRP lay-up, a different internal layout and fit-out,
  and slightly smaller sail area. She has a balanced lug rig with a tan sail of clipper
  canvas made by James Lawrence and a new one of cream dacron made by Steve Hall of
  North Sea Sails. Both sails have two sets of reefing points. She has two mast positions
  and can be rigged as a gunter sloop. All the necessary fittings (shroud plates,
  jib sheet cleats and fairleads etc) are there. Sails well in all conditions but
  is an ideal heavy weather boat.</p>
