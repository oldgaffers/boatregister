full_description: "<p>She was built for the Swedish Customs Service, first named Ran\
  \ and based at Torekov until 1912. She was said to be too large for Torekov; and\
  \ Gustaffson built a smaller sister ship, the 27ft Kryess, still a yacht at Malmo.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1919 she was converted to the yacht &#39;Trogen&#39; and owned by a\
  \ Judge, sold to Bertil Freisler of Malmo and altered to wheel steering and had\
  \ a 10 hp engine fitted. Converted to Bermudan rig, in 1933 she was sold to Gunnar\
  \ Malmquist (an Army officer?) to sail round the world and was converted back to\
  \ a gaff cutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She appeared on the British Yacht Register at Cowes,\
  \ later up on the English East Coast. Owned for 30 years by George Arnott Woodbridge,\
  \ Suffolk, who cruised as far as the Netherlands, her next owner, Geoffrey Ingram-Smith\
  \ took her as far as Cherbourg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&#39;Atalanta was bought in 1970\
  \ at Gt. Yarmouth by Robert Simper of Ramsholt, Suffolk and returned to the River\
  \ Deben and used for family cruises around the Thames Estuary and for taking part\
  \ in OGA races rallies and other traditional boat events.</p>"
