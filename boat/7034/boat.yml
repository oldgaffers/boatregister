full_description: |-
  The first Bermudian yacht built  by Cole and Wiggins, whose yard in Leigh-on-Sea later became
  Johnson and Jago.

  Pre WWII she sailed out of Littlehampton, but from 1952 she was based in North
  Kent before migrating north over the Thames in the 1969s. During the 1970s she
  was sunk on her mooring in Pagglesham due to a collision, but was refloated and
  repaired before being sold to a new owner who kept her at Glasson Dock. Her
  history after 2016 is not known.
