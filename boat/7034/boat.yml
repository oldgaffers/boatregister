  but from 1952 she was based in North\nKent before migrating north over the Thames
  in the 1969s. During the 1970s she\nwas sunk on her mooring in Pagglesham due to
  a collision, but was refloated and\nrepaired before being sold to a new owner who
  kept her at Glasson Dock. Her\nhistory after 2016 is not known."
