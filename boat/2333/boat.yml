full_description: "<p>Built in Frederick Hawke&#39;s Stonehouse Yard in 1899, &#39;Shamrock&#39;\
  \ started her career as a ketch rigged sailing barge to carry cargo between Plymouth\
  \ and Torpoint. After World War I, in 1919, she was sold for &pound;600 to a group\
  \ of quarrymen and had an engine installed. She was then used for carrying stone\
  \ from the River Lynher quarries to Dartmouth and Falmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing\
  \ work as a cargo barge, including salvage and dredging in the South West, she was\
  \ eventually laid up in 1973 at Hooe Lake, near Plymouth in a derelict state. Rescued\
  \ by the National Trust, she was taken to Cotehele Quay for restoration in 1974.</p>"
