full_description: "<p>&#39;Cormorant&#39; was designed and built by Lukes of Hamble\
  \ in 1911. She was rebuilt by Peter Brookes, then of Maldon. Work included most\
  \ of the sawn oak frames and steamed timbers being replaced. All iron strap floors\
  \ were replaced with new laminate iroko floors, new dead-woods and ally-bronze keel\
  \ bolts were fitted. She was completely refastened and had a new teak cockpit. Her\
  \ sails are made by the sailmakers Cormorant Sails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being based\
  \ in Tollesbury, where she was often seen being paddled back to her mooring, she\
  \ returned to Cowes in 2016.</p>"
