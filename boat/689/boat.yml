  Alert*. Immediately after the war it was possible to get timber to rebuild
  yachts but not to build new.
full_description: |-
  Daniel G Hatcher was famous for building Solent fishing boats in the 1860s.


  Just after the Second World War, 1946, she was completely rebuilt by Whisstock's
  at Maldon, Essex, and re-named the *Young Alert*. At this time, it was possible
  to get timber to repair old yachts, but not to build new ones. She continued
  under the name 'Alert' until she came into the care of Dr Tommy Wilks OBE who
  owned her from 1953 -63. He renamed her 'Young Alert' in 1953. He was clearly a
  formidable man, ex cavalry officer and local GP. There is an affectionate
  pen-portrait of him on the Benfleet Community Archive website. Young Alert owned
  by Mike Beckett 1975 - 84 and rescued from rather delapidated state.Cruised
  between Holland and Brittany. Owned by George Beckett from 1984
