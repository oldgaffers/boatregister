  Sailed by P Treadgold who has her on a long term loan.


  At 27 foot and 4 foot draft, *Dorothea* was probably built as a Victorian yacht
  on Prawner lines. Prawners were two man boats of 35 or more foot length,
  trawling heavy gear in water deep enough to accommodate 4 foot draft. "Old man's
  boats" of 30 foot and less exist, but they were shallow drafted, at less than 3
  foot, nearer two.
