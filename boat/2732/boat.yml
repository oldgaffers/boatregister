short_description: <p>&#39;Greensleeves&#39; is a 19&#39; Memory &#39;with two 7&#39;
  berths, a cooker, sink, red and black bucket, a good sail wardrobe and two outboards&#39;.</p>
full_description: "<p>Skipper, Roy Hart, has sailed many nautical miles, mostly single-handed\
  \ in &lsquo;Greensleeves&rsquo;. She has many modifications for long sea passages.\
  \ We carry two outboards, one in the well and one on a bracket. She has excellent\
  \ ground tackle and exceedingly good navigation lights. The lead ballast is firmly\
  \ lashed in with small lorry straps, and there is a semi self-draining cockpit which\
  \ also has flotation. There are two bilge pumps, one which is an extremely large\
  \ whale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When making the passage to Cherbourg in rough weather, summer\
  \ 2015, one comment was made that it was a foolhardy trip! Roy&#39;s response is:\
  \ &quot;I have 52 years of sailing experience, well over 100,000 sea miles under\
  \ my belt plus I do take my sailing extremely seriously. I gave the person a quote\
  \ made by Chris Bonnington, who had just lost a friend on a mountaineering expedition.\
  \ He had replied to a similar comment by saying: &lsquo;We take risks not to escape\
  \ life, but to prevent life escaping us.&rsquo;&quot;</p>"
