full_description: |-
  *Worm* is a Mouse pram built from plans in 2010 and is tender to *Robinetta.*
  She is the best tender one could imagine. She rows well and can take three
  adults. She hardly ever takes a drop of water in whilst being towed.

  In company with Robinetta, she's circumnavigated the islands of Britain, Ireland
  and Mainland (Orkney) and cruised much of the coast of Brittany. Iain's design
  proposes a gunter rig for the Mouse Pram. *Worm* has a standing lug.
