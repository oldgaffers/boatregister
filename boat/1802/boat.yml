short_description: <p>Wind Song is the first boat built to a Maurice Griffith design.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Wind Song&#39; is the first Maurice Griffiths boat, built\
  \ in 1928/9 by &nbsp;G. Feltham of Portsmouth for Henry Tompson who had seen the\
  \ design for a Shallow Draught Wildfowling Yacht in Yachting Monthly and who wanted\
  \ a boat for winter sport in Chichester Harbour. She is teak on elm with very flat\
  \ bilge and an unusual but strong centreboard which operates by tackle through a\
  \ slot in the foredeck. With the plate up she draws only 2&#39; 6&quot;, ideal for\
  \ creek crawling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maurice Griffiths owned the boat for a few years\
  \ from 1949 by which time she had a tall Bermudian rig, no bowsprit and apparently\
  \ rather questionable handling. She features on the cover of his book Sixty Years\
  \ a Yacht Designer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She survived a fire in the early 1970s and\
  \ was later owned by Dr Rhyss Jones whose son, Griff comments rather unfavourably\
  \ on her in his autobiography!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An excellent restoration in the 1990s\
  \ included the return of the gaff rig, the laid deck being replaced by epoxy covered\
  \ plywood and the fitting of a number of floors which evidently had been omited&nbsp;from\
  \ the original construction, thus eliminating a number of leaks which had plagued\
  \ the boat for some years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After many years on the East Coast she\
  \ returned to Chichester Harbour and continues to give much pleasure pottering about\
  \ the Solent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014 the old faithful Volvo diesel was replaced by\
  \ a modern Beta 25 HP.</p>"
