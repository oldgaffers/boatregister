short_description: <p>Panacea was the first (and only) boat of her class, designed
  by Stephen Prout</p>
full_description: "<p>Panacea was built in 1997 as the first of six intended builds\
  \ to a design by Stephen Prout in Woodbridge, Suffolk. In the event she was the\
  \ only one built. Stephen sailed her extensively around the Suffolk, Essex&nbsp;and\
  \ Thames Estuary coastline before selling her in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her next owner\
  \ took her to the South West of Ireland on her trailer where she was sailed locally\
  \ until 2012 when she was sold on again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being trailered to\
  \ Dun Laoghaire Harbour she sank on her moorings in the inner harbour (a botched\
  \ stern gland re-packing prior to re-purchase). Since being raised,&nbsp;she has\
  \ sailed on the East Coast of Ireland between Howth and Wicklow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She\
  \ has been laid up in a field in Wexford since 2018, and passed into new ownership\
  \ 2019.</p>"
