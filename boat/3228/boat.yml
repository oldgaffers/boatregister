full_description: <p>Camay was a Normandy class, thought of as a &#39;stretched Vertue&#39;.
  She has had a virtual re-build in 2013-14, so now good for another 50 years!</p><p>She
  has the body lines, rig, perfect balance and classic good looks of her predecessor
  but is markedly different in underwater form, keel shape and rudder configuration.
  Camay is strip plank construction, larch on oak; cascover sheathed below waterline
  with silver spruce spars. Her coachroof, cockpit, coamings, rails etc., are varnished
  teak, sapele and iroko coachroof with painted ply decks.</p><p>Her very 1960s accomodation
  comprises 1/4 berth, two settee berths, in cabin and room for two more in the forepeak.</p><p>Following
  her 2017 refit she now has Oxford blue topsides, a completely refurbished mast -
  the silver spruce gleaming in 25 coats of Deks Olje!&nbsp; To eliminate chafe the
  wire main halyard has been replaced by 4mm &#39;Spectra&#39; which works beautifully
  on the existing bronze winch &amp; sheave.</p><p>Atempts to sell her in 2019 failed,
  and she ended up bing broken up as&nbsp; hulk, but parts&nbsp; of &#39;Camay&#39;
  will survive her - (mast, boom to be used by the Blyth Tall Ship Project on &#39;Puddleduck&#39;&nbsp;
  &amp; some sails &amp; covers to &#39;Wagtail&#39; ).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
