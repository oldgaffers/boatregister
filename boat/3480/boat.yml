full_description: 'Tinkerbell is a Bembridge scow (11ft 3" x 4ft9") built by A.A.
  Coombes in approx. 1955. Coombes still builds dinghys and tell me they did not give
  them numbers.  I was given the dinghy when it was in poor condition with many split
  lands but restored it using epoxy (see PBO article August 2020 Restoring a Bembridge
  Scow. This article is also available on the internet). I have also put in Mahogany
  side thwarts to make her more comfortable to sit in. She traditionally had an orange
  lug sail but this was rotten so I replaced it with a new white sail with No 4 on
  it.  She has a small foredeck. <p> Now fully restored she  sails very well. '
