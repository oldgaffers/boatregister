full_description: <p>Fionn was built in Australia by her first owner, who unusually,
  for a Vertue,&nbsp;fitted her out as a gaff cutter. She sailed in East Coast Australian
  waters until Steve Woods returned to England, and loved her too much to sell her.
  He therefore had her shipped to the UK.</p><p>In recent years Fionn has been re-splined,
  and her running and standing rigging renewed. Her bowsprit has been made retractable,
  and she has had extensive upgrade to her electric systemss including an echo pilot
  forward looking sonar, marine radio and Weems and Plath instrumentation (inc chonometer
  and barometer).</p><p>Registered Australia 1987 no. 852796</p>
