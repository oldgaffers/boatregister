  needed rebuild to restore her to her former glory.
full_description: |-
  Built in 1923 by R Jackman and Sons for Alf Lovis  *Torbay Lass* was one of
  the last Brixham sailing trawlers built.

  Her construction marks the beginning of the end of fishing under sail from
  Brixham and her configuration was traditional and basic.

  Records show that she had a distinguished career and was a notably good sailing
  vessel, being involved in 1935 in rescuing the disabled 3 masted schooner
  *Welcome* with a cargo of 200 tons of coal, the Torbay Lass towed her under sail
  away from Pendeen Head back to Newlyn, preventing her from being wrecked on the
  Wolf Rock.

  In 1936 *Torbay Lass*won the King George V Cup in the Brixham Trawler Race

  In 1937 she was 'retired', bought by an Essex builder named Bradshaw and
  converted for pleasure yachting with the addition of twin engines. He took her
  on a voyage in 1938 just before Hitler invaded Poland. She was ordered off the
  water while cruising along the East coast, spending the war years inland behind
  Lowestoft.

  She was purchased by Lady Claude Hamilton and refitted with luxurious
  accommodation  and  renamed "Kenya Jacaranda" she was copper clad to the
  waterline and other changes appropriate for activity in warm tropical waters
  this never transpired and she was moved to the Hamble after the war and was
  never used again

  What we know for certain is that, in 1949, still copper clad and still owned by
  Lady Hamilton she was wallowing in mud in a creek near Southampton. Rescued from
  the Hamble she went into service on the Thames, training Sea Cadets in 1951.

  KJ had taken some 4000 young people to sea between 1951 and 1979 when she was
  squeezed out of her London berths by Docklands developments. At the same time
  the Bermondsey Sea Cadets were finding it almost impossible to maintain her.

  The ship was moved 'temporarily' to Tilbury Dock in 1980 re-grouped as the
  "Mayflower Sail Training Society" and carried on more or less as before,
  enabling youngsters from deprived areas of Greater London to sail a traditional
  sailing vessel at an affordable price. She was based   in Tilbury for over 30
  years.

  Between 1980 and 2006, Kenya Jacaranda 'enabled' some 3000 young people (and an
  unknown number of adults) to get afloat. She competed in the Brixham Trawler
  Race at least twice, with MSTS crew. The Mayflower Sail Training Society was
  disbanded in 2007, and a new charity was formed to look after her “Kenya
  Jackaranda Heritage Sailing”

  In 2014 with a lack of funding she was in the process of being transferred to
  Trinity Sailing in Brixham to be rebuilt with the help of a Lottery Grant,
  unfortunately this application was withdrawn after an initial grant and the
  future of the vessel was then unsure, Tilbury Docks wanted the vessel removed
  and a temporary home was offered  in Maldon and she was moved to the River
  Blackwater up to Downs Road Boatyard on the 15^^th^^ June 2014

  After some time of an uncertain future the charity was handed over and renamed
  Heritage Marine Foundation

  She is now in a poor state of repair and kept afloat with pumps while her future
  restoration is being organised.
