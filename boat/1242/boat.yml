short_description: <p>&#39;Avola&#39; is a fine example of a 1960s wooden cruising
  yacht. Designed as a &#39;one off&#39; for the original owner just before the explosion
  of GRP production yachts.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Avola&#39; is a gaff rigged cutter with a good sailing\
  \ performance. She has an inboard 50HP Nainni diesel engine with a cruising speed\
  \ of 6 knots. The wheelhouse was added in the 1980s without having to make any alteration\
  \ to the rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Avola&#39; cruises extensively in Northern Europe,\
  \ the Baltic and Russia. At the Shipmate Classic Yacht Regatta in 2007 she won the\
  \ prestigious Shipmate of Tradition Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her name comes from a town\
  \ in Sicily famous for its wine from Nero d&rsquo;Avola grapes. At the invasion\
  \ of Sicily on 10 July 1943 about 75 troops of the British 50th division of the\
  \ 8th Army landed at Avola. The original owner was one of the first to set foot\
  \ at Avola, and later named his boat to remember the occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ 2015, &#39;Avola&#39; celebrated her 50th birthday in style on both sides of the\
  \ North Sea with the East Coast OGA and on a cruise in the Netherlands. OGA members\
  \ may read about the cruise in the December 2015 and Spring 2016 Gaffers Log.</p>"
