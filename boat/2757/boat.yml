  sales_text: <p>A piece of Irish tradition with a Dutch touch. Sailing her successor
    for three years means I have to sell my dear Moorhen. A traditional Galway Hooker
    Iâ€™ve built in wood epoxy, launched 1996. Fully equipped, 4 berths, cooker inside
    and outside, ready to sail, with a marinised VW Golf 40 Hp diesel engine. As a
    working boat, with weather helm typical for this craft, she is easy to handle.
    I sailed her single-handed on inland waters. A sound ship, she needs some attention
    as she has not sailed since 2012.</p>
