  sales_text: "<p>A piece of Irish tradition with a Dutch touch. Sailing her successor\
    \ for three years means I have to sell my dear Moorhen. A traditional Galway Hooker\
    \ I\u2019ve built in wood epoxy, launched 1996. Fully equipped, 4 berths, cooker\
    \ inside and outside, ready to sail, with a marinised VW Golf 40 Hp diesel engine.\
    \ As a working boat, with weather helm typical for this craft, she is easy to\
    \ handle. I sailed her single-handed on inland waters. A sound ship, she needs\
    \ some attention as she has not sailed since 2012.</p>"
