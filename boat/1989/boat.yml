  Originally called a Mayfly Corsaire (Demonstrator no 2) she is now known as an
  Oystercatcher 20.


  She sleeps three in the cabin (and two outside in the cockpit!) and is fitted
  with a sea toilet and small galley. The interior was professionally fitted and
  finished during original construction and uses hardwoods and sapele faced ply.
  There are ample cave lockers and a forward, deep sail locker.


  Built in 1997 as a cutter, at some point the mast was moved forward to convert
  her to a sloop. A Yanmar engine was fitted in 2003 and she was mainly used under
  power in the Plymouth Sound by her owner at that time. David Botterill purchased
  her in 2007 from Barbican Yacht Agency and had her fitted with a sea toilet in
  the vacant heads and waste water seacock for the galley. In 2008 James Lawrence
  made her a new headsail and modified the existing mainsail to give more height
  in the cockpit. They also supplied new running rigging. Tony MacKillican made a
  new tiller. She proved to be an excellent sea boat and she cruised in the
  Bristol Channel and spent three summers in the Milford Haven.


  In 2013 she underwent a complete repaint of the hull and topsides including
  coppercoat antifoul and non-slip finish on repainted deck and cockpit. All to
  high professional standards courtesy of Dave Freemantle at Cardiff Marine.  All
  standing rigging was replaced. A new cabin sole was cut in Robbins teak veneer.
  The boom was extended by 2' at the goose neck to effect an overhang on the
  transom (it didn't previously as a result of the mast being moved forward and
  was consequently a bit difficult to stash in a marina or on a pontoon) and James
  Lawrence made a new mainsail to take account of her new dimensions.


  If anything, she is better balanced on the tiller under sail than before as a
  result of the changes to the boom length and the beautiful new mainsail.


  In 2013 she was on a river mooring in Keyhaven and sailed in the Solent during
  that glorious summer to attend the OGA 50 Rally at Cowes. Her photo shows Denis,
  my sailing buddy, and David Botterill, on the OGA Bristol Channel 'Up Channel'
  Cruise in June 2014 just off the Port of Cardiff. Since the photograph I have
  added an anchor housing on the bowsprit enabling easier launch and retreival of
  a Delta anchor. In 2017 Rudders Yard upgraded her power source with a fixed
  solar panel and auxillary battery wired through a new power switch. A new conrol
  lever and cable was fitted by the yard in 2018, along with fittings for a new
  tiller pilot. In the last few months I have continued to make her more friendly
  for single handed sailing with all halyards and reefing lines leading to the
  cockpit. The topping lift leads to a cleat on the starboard cabin roof, the
  throat and gaff halyard feed through a new Barton deck organiser and a pair of
  clutches on the port side.
