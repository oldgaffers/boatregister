full_description: "<p>Polly Garter&#39;s first owner collected her new from Cornish\
  \ Crabbers in 1978 where she was launched. After a week in the Camel learning about\
  \ topsails, she was sailed to Mumbles in S Wales, then on to Barry, Portishead and\
  \ up the Severn Estuary with the odd 10 knots under her and into the lock&nbsp;\
  \ at Sharpness. Carrying on up to Worcester and into the River Avon &#39;Polly Garter&#39;\
  \ settled into her smooring. Being too big for the river, really, with the mooring\
  \ above the bridge over the M5, meant half lowering the mast for each trip down\
  \ to Tewkesbury, to get under the M5! All good fun and her owner was very sad to\
  \ sell here to a new owner at Milford Haven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is she called &#39;Polly\
  \ Garter&#39;? She was named by her first owner after Polly Garter, the woman of\
  \ loose morals in Dylan Thomas&#39;s Under Milkwood, a play he loved and could quote\
  \ all sorts of passages from.</p>"
