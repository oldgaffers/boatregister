  Sold by Hunters as a kit boat, she but seems to have taken a long time to
  complete. It's not clear which of the early owners actually launched her.
full_description: |-
  Sold by Hunters as a kit to Mr Menhinick, she may not have been completed by
  him. Her sail number, 114, implies that she was one of the last of the
  Minstrel/Liberty 23 boats produced by Hunters. The hull was designed for the
  twin unstayed masts of the Liberty 22 and then modified for the Liberty 23. The
  Minstrel 23 used the same hull with a gunter rig.

  'Boru' has not been spared some hard sailing and is probably best described as
  well used. Significant modifications include a conversion to a high peak gaff
  rig - longer hollow mast, larger tabernacle, gaff saddle etc.
