short_description: <p>Sold by Hunters as a kit boat, she but seems to have&nbsp;taken
  a long time to complete. It&#39;s not clear which of the early owners actually launched
  her.</p>
full_description: "<p>Sold by Hunters as a kit to Mr Menhinick, she may not have been\
  \ completed by him. Her sail number, 114, implies that she was one of the last of\
  \ the Minstrel/Liberty 23 boats produced by Hunters. The hull was designed for the\
  \ twin unstayed masts of the Liberty 22 and then modified for the Liberty 23. The\
  \ Minstrel 23&nbsp;used the same hull with a gunter rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Boru&#39;\
  \ has not been spared some hard sailing and is probably best described as well used.\
  \ Significant modifications include a conversion to a high peak gaff rig - longer\
  \ hollow mast, larger tabernacle, gaff saddle etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
