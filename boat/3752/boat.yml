  Sorona was designed and built by Bertie Slater of the Shipyard Co. Ltd in
  Ballyholme, Bangor. Bearing the sail number S20, it is the last of 20 low cabin
  S Class yachts built between 1947 and 1963. Sorona spent most of its life
  between Bangor, Skerries, Drogheda and now onto Carlingford, having completed
  regular trips to Scotland and the Isle Of Man. This six ton cruiser built with
  Mahogany planks on an oak frame is strong, well built, steady and very well
  suited to the waters around Ireland.
