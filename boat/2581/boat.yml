short_description: <p>&#39;Bravore&#39; is a sprit-rigged double-ender. Originally
  an inshore fishing vessel, now a coastal cruiser.</p>
full_description: She has undergone a major rebuild in 2004 with new planks to waterline,
  joggled frames, deck, mast and rudder. New complete sailing rig including mast step,
  mast, sails and all rigging. Her owner milled all the timber from his own trees,
  except the plywood for the deck. She's half-decked, with a loose-footed flat-headed
  sprit set up with snotter, stanliff and brails similar to Thames barges.
