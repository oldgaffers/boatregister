full_description: "Log 79/3, 80/1, 80/2, 81/1, 82/2  Built as an estuary racer at\
  \ Ramsgate before the 1914-18 war for use in the Medway.  She was evidently kept\
  \ in the Medway until purchased by Prior of Burnham, from whom she was bought in\
  \ 1936 for a total sum of \xA350.  She was then kept at Burnham, where she was used\
  \ as a day sailer and weekend cruiser.  The mast was originally mounted on a tabernacle,\
  \ which possibly at one time enabled her to get under the bridge's Rochester.  This\
  \ was removed because it let in too much water.  In 1937 the cabin was raised 3\
  \ inches and 5 inches aft to give comfortable sitting headroom.  Winner of the East\
  \ Coast Old Gaffers Trophy in 1975."
