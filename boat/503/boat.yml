short_description: <p>'Roma' was built in 1907 of pitch pine on massive oak frames
  as a salmon fishing boat. No two timbers are the same distance apart, clearly built
  by eye. Converted to a yacht in 1919 with two berths. &nbsp;The new owner , in Barcelona,
  has renamed the boat Roamer as orginally named.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Roma&#39; was originally a salmon&nbsp;fishing boat carrying\
  \ 450 sq. ft of sail. When these boats left to go fishing they carried sacks of\
  \ gravel, and as salmon&nbsp;were caught the gravel was tipped over the side. She\
  \ was clearly built by eye as no two frames are the same distance apart.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>&#39;Roma&#39; was converted to a yacht with two berths in 1919. She has\
  \ sailed to Majorca and back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She weighs 3.5 tons plus 3/4 tons of\
  \ lead ballast. Completely refitted over a four year period with all suspect timber\
  \ replaced to original quality or better, originally the boat was 3/4 decked. The\
  \ cabin and current cockpit are fitted entirely within the original well, the cabin\
  \ and coamings are in teak, the cockpit largely fitted out in oak with the engine\
  \ under the cockpit sole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A long iron keel was added at conversion\
  \ to a yacht, with new keel bolts through to new floors.</p>"
