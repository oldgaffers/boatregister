full_description: |-
  Lindy has been in the Beale / Burgoyne Family since 1971. She was bought by my
  Father from a Mr Miller of Cambridge who used to write about his cruises
  particularly in France with his wife which were published in Yachting Monthly
  under DCM Accountancy Assistant. She was originally built by David Hillyard for
  an Irishman and was called Graineog in 1924, by 1929 she was back with David
  Hillyard and was owned by a couple of people. In 1945 she was purchased by Vice
  Admiral Sir Lancelot Bell Davis KBE, who sailed her on the South Coast with his
  wife until 1950 when she was sold again as he took on his fathers yacht the
  Marjorie.


  Since she has been in the family we have cruised throughout Holland and Germany
  particularly with Friesian Islands, she visited London and went all the way to
  Twickenham having lowered the mast at St Katherines. Since 1991 her cruising
  exploits have not been so great just the local rivers in Essex as the family
  have a 9 ton Hillyard, which is slightly bigger for cruising!!.


  She raced in the Old Gaffers races in the 70/80's winning a number of trophies,
  and also participated in the Heineken Rally in 1974, appearing in Motor Boat and
  Yachting.


  She has had new decks fitted as well as a new engine.Â  But apart from some
  alterations below deck to allow for family holidays ie the removal of a
  wardrobe! she is very much original.
