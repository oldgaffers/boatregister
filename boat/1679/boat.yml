    PATIENT GRISELDA is a 25-foot gaff cutter, designed by Francis Jones and
    originally built for journalist and writer John Lewis. She is a traditional
    wooden yacht with classic lines, offering an exciting project for the right
    buyer.


    **General Condition**


    The yacht has been neglected for some time but appears to have benefited from
    significant investment in the past. The deck areas, superstructure, and cockpit
    seem structurally sound but are in need of cleaning and painting. Internally,
    the vessel was found to be surprisingly tidy, though damp and dirty.


    **Accommodation**


    * Central saloon and living area
    * Small galley (basin missing)
    * Two settee berths (cushions in fair condition, though the starboard cushion was wet)
    * Small navigation area
    * Forward fo’c’sle area fitted for storage and workshop space
    * “Porta Potti” toilet facilities
    * Traditional painted and varnished timber finishes, generally attractive


    **Rigging & Sails**


    PATIENT GRISELDA is fitted with a gaff cutter rig, including:


    * Timber mast (possibly pitch pine, not confirmed)
    * Boom, bowsprit, and whisker pole
    * Galvanised steel wire standing rigging and guard wires (secure at the time of inspection)
    * Weathered and dirty running rigging


    **Sails:**


    * **Jib** – Canvas, ochre in colour, well-used
    * **Staysail** – Dacron, tan bark in colour, well-used
    * **Mainsail** – Canvas, ochre in colour, weathered and aged, stowed on the boom
    * **Mainsail cover** – Serviceable


    **Equipment (All in Unknown Condition)**


    * **Engine:** Lister SR2 air-cooled diesel engine (turns over freely with crank handle and decompression levers, visually tidy)
    * **Cooking:** Origo 3000 two-burner alcohol cooker with pan clamps
    * **Navigation & Communication:**
    * Standard Horizon GX13000E DSC VHF radio
    * Cobra HH350 handheld VHF radio
    * Plastimo Contest bulkhead-mounted steering compass (cockpit)
    * Garmin GPS 120XL receiver
    * **Safety Equipment:**
    * Fast Find Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) – Expired 2021
    * Safe Link Solo PLB – Expired 2020
    * **Anchoring & Mooring:**
    * Traditional manual anchor windlass
    * Plough-style anchor stowed on deck


    **Conclusion**


    PATIENT GRISELDA requires a thorough refit, but the hull is likely sound. She is
    a charming, classic yacht that, with care and restoration, could provide great
    enjoyment to the right owner. She is lying on a mooring in the River Dart, and
    must be removed from the harbour on purchase.
