short_description: <p>Elwing was the first Memory 19 to be built with a cabin and
  a cutter rig</p>
full_description: <p>Elwing's hull was built by Eric Bergqvist and Richard Dodds who
  was working with Eric as sparmaker/boatbuilder. The hull was epoxied below the waterline
  from new, it was used to make a new mould in December 1976. Richard designed both
  cabins and the rig and had his rig drawings approved by Tony Robinson. She was launched
  at Falmouth in August 1978 when Richard was at the boat building college there.
  The cabin was redesigned shorter in the late 1980's making the cockpit longer and
  more usable.</p>
