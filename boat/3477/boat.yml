short_description: <p>A Canoe Yawl designed by David Moss that has similarities to
  George Holmes (eg EEL) and Albert Strange's Humber Yawls</p>
full_description: '<p>Based quite closely on the Humber Canoe Yawls. Two lug sails,
  the mizzen set very close to the stern.</p><p>Fully decked with high combings and
  a raised seat for the helmsman on the side deck.</p><p>The very long centerboard
  only hinges down about 30 degrees as per the Humber Yawls drawn by Holmes and Strange.
  The draft with the board down is 2.45 ft.</p><p>Note: a previous owner has had the
  area covered by the first reef cut off in one of the mainsails! The listed sail
  area is for the original dimensions but 2'' 3" have been removed from the luff /
  vertical hight of one main sail! There is still another full sized mainsail that
  is suitable for racing, the small sail is better for single handed sailing.</p>'
