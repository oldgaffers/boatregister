short_description: <p>A Canoe Yawl designed by David Moss that has similarities to
  George Holmes (eg EEL) and Albert Strange's Humber Yawls</p>
full_description: '<p>Based quite closely on the Humber Canoe Yawls. Two lug sails,
  the mizzen set very close to the stern.</p><p>Fully decked with high combings and
  a raised seat for the helmsman on the side deck.</p><p>The very long centerboard
  only hinges down about 30 degrees as per the Humber Yawls drawn by Holmes and Strange.
  The draft with the board down is 2.45 ft.</p><p>Note: a previous owner has had the
  area covered by the first reef cut off in one of the mainsails! The listed sail
  area is for the original dimensions but 2'' 3" have been removed from the luff /
  vertical hight of one main sail! There is still another full sized mainsail that
  is suitable for racing, the small sail is better for single handed sailing.</p>'

  sales_text: '<em>Doris</em> is a Sea Otter 15 from the yard of the award winning
    boat builder David Moss at Skippool creek near Blackpool. She came second in her
    class, three up in light winds in the 2021 Maldon Regatta.<p>The Sea Otter 15
    is a fully decked, minimally ballasted day boat with a lug main and mizzen on
    unstayed masts. With two sails set on booms tacking is simple but sailing requires
    some skill to get the best out of her. David has developed his Sea Otter range
    of double ended Canoe Yawls following his apprenticeship building local double
    ended pilot boats. David''s tapering strip planking follows the conventional line
    of the sheer. as would be the case in carvel boatbuilding, allowing the bright
    finished interior to show the wood grain. The outside of the hull is faired and
    covered in hardwood veneer producing a very fine paint finished surface.<p><em>Doris</em>
    had her 21st birthday this year but you would be hard pressed to guess that from
    her well maintained appearance. <p><em>Doris</em> comes complete with two sets
    of sails, cockpit and travelling covers, a decent pair of oars, buoyancy, Honda
    2.3 long shaft outboard (2020) and a well prepared road trailer plus the usual
    required extras.<p>See Davidmossboatbuilders.co.uk '
