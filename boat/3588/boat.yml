short_description: <p>Moulds taken from Sir William Priestley&nbsp;</p>
full_description: '<p>These moulds were taken by Eric Berquvist, from the Sir William
  Priestley, just as she retired and was relocated to Lancaster Maritime Museum. They
  were to be used for the "Freda" class. Although a few other hulls were moulded,
  Eric only completed "Freda" in her entirety.</p>

  <p>I''m preserving these moulds for the future, to ensure the lines are safe in
  full scale form. I''m also happy for genuine enquiries about any lover of the prawners
  regarding the making use of the moulds.</p>'
