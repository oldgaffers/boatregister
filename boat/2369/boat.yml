  \ South Africa in July 2003. She is a white boat, there are only three others I\
  \ believe in existence, &#39;Zest&#39; (Hull 28), &#39;Sarabella&#39; (Hull 46)\
  \ and &#39;Zephyr&#39; (Hull 47).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Halcyon&#39; has been with\
  \ the same owner, Simon Head, from new and was picked up from Bursledon in Hampshire.\
  \ She still has all the original paperwork and was handed over by Nick and Lyndsay\
  \ Voorhoeve from Cape Yachts personally and rigged up for the first time there.\
  \ It was during rigging up that Simon had a phone call from Bob Brown, Honnor Marine,\
  \ saying that he had bought the rights to build the Cape Cutter 19 in the UK at\
  \ Rochdale. Honnor Marine still build the Cape Cutter 19 in Rochdale and Bob has\
  \ been an enthusiast for the boat since he took over production in the UK.</p>\r\
