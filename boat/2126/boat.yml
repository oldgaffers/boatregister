  is probably the only clinker Zulu left in the world.</p>
full_description: "<p>Built at Hay &amp; Co., Lerwick in 1910, &#39;Kate&#39; was\
  \ 41&#39;6&quot; long, Zulu class, clinker built with two lug sails.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>In 1920, an engine was installed but by 1946 she was semi-derelict and bought\
  \ by the Tait family of Burra. Re-named &#39;Sunbeam&#39;, fishing no. LK453, she\
  \ continued to fish having had a complete overhaul and new engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ the 1960s she was sold to an owner in Lowestoft and laid up at Oulton Broad. Since\
  \ 1998 Gramah Brewster and Don Windley have been restoring her, passing her into\
  \ the hands of Martin Goodman in early 2012. Her name has been changed back to &#39;Kate&#39;.</p>\r\
