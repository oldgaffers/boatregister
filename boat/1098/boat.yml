short_description: <p>Flamingo is a yacht built in 1930. A major restoration was begun
  in 1995 and is ongoing in 2014 after two changes in ownership.</p>
full_description: "<p>Flamingo has very little documentation. David Smallwood laid\
  \ &#39;Flamingo&#39; up in 1981 and embarked on restoration work in 1995 with a\
  \ projected launch date 2002. Sadly, he died before completing the task.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>Tim Davey bought her from David&#39;s widow, more to prevent her being scrapped\
  \ than any serious intent to fix her up. Jonathan bought her from Tim in August\
  \ 2014. She had some repairs to the planking, a new engine, some pretty poor interior\
  \ fitting out, the rig has been restored, she has a new rudder, new deck and a reconditioned\
  \ Baby Blake toilet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014 she was moved into Jonathan&#39;s orchard\
  \ where he hopes to complete the work. Visit the boat&#39;s website to see progress.</p>"
