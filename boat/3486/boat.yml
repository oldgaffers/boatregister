name: Dayspring
oga_no: 3486
rig_type: Cutter
mainsail_type: gaff
short_description: Cruising version of the Falmouth Working boat similar to the Heard
  28 and the Tamerisk 29
full_description: 'The original owner commissioned Percy Dalton to take the lines
  of one of the original working boats and contacted Cygnus Marine to construct the
  hull to the then relevant ''White Fish Authority'' standard. This resulted in a
  very solid 8.3 tonne vessel. The rig was designd by Percy Dalton and the interior
  was designed and fitted out by the original owner.


  <div>The boat was sold to Ron Arnold in 2009 who kept her in Weymouth and had plans
  to take her to the Mediterranean by way of the French canals. With his trip in mind,
  Ron han a new Collars mast and gaff made, updated to the interior and replaced the
  running rigging. Sadly the trip to the Mediterranean never happened and Ron died
  in early 2020.</div>


  <div>Dayspring came into my ownership in September 2020 and I plan to keep her in
  Plymouth and hope to attend various regattas in the coming years.</div>'
