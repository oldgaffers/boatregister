full_description: |-
  The original owner commissioned Percy Dalton to take the lines of one of the
  original working boats and contacted Cygnus Marine to construct the hull to the
  then relevant 'White Fish Authority' standard. This resulted in a very solid 8.3
  tonne vessel. The rig was designd by Percy Dalton and the interior was designed
  and fitted out by the original owner.

  The boat was sold to Ron Arnold in 2009 who kept her in Weymouth and had plans
  to take her to the Mediterranean by way of the French canals. With his trip in
  mind, Ron had a new Collars mast and gaff made, updated to the interior and
  replaced the running rigging. Sadly the trip to the Mediterranean never happened
  and Ron died in early 2020. Dayspring came into my ownership in September 2020
  and I plan to keep her in Plymouth and hope to attend various regattas in the
  coming years.
