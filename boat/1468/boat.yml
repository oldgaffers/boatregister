  sales_text: <p>Like all Heard 28s "Sally J" is a seaworthy and reasonably fast yacht,
    often admired. She was built in 1981 as a Falmouth racing open boat based on the
    famous Falmouth oyster dredging work boats. Later she was converted to a cruising
    yacht, utilising solid hard wood timber.</p><p>The 2012 renovation made the boat
    not only as new but as comfortable as any modern yacht.</p><p>With the furling
    and roller reefing foresails and easy main slab reefing she proves to be a safe
    and workable craft for small crew or single handed.</p><p>Lying Neyland Pembrokeshire.</p>
