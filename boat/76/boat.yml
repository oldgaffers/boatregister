full_description: "<p>The Brixham trawler &#39;Vigilance&#39; BM76, a gaff-rigged\
  \ ketch, was built in 1926 and spent time with the local fishing fleet before seeing\
  \ war service as a mooring vessel for barrage balloons. Since 1945 she has cruised\
  \ extensively as a leisure yacht, for filming, under charter and as a sail training\
  \ vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was owned by OGA member Ken Harris, carpenter and cabinet-maker,\
  \ from1955 until 1997. When he bought her she had had a fire and was burnt down\
  \ to the waterline. Ken gradually re-built her over a number of years, eventually\
  \ getting her back to sailing. He lived on board, sailing mostly along the South\
  \ Coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997 she was bought by the Vigilance Preservation Society\
  \ and returned to Brixham.</p>"
