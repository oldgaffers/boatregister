  \ Cross Country Tour, 2014, <a href=\"http://www.sailing-by.org.uk/content/bembridge-belgium-single-handed-july-2014\"\
  >visit 'Sailing by'</a>.</p>\n<p>Copy of notes received from previous owners in\
  \ 2012:</p>\n<p>History of 'East Breeze'</p>\n<p>East Breeze is a Tamarisk 22 gaff\
  \ rigged cutter, designed by David Cannell and built approx. 1975 by North Sea Craft\
  \ of Brundall, Norfolk. The Tamarisk 22 was the forerunner of the Tamarisk 24, and\
  \ based on a hull mould taken from the Itchen Ferry \u2018Nellie\u201D. We know\
  \ of one other Tamarisk 22, \u2018Scandal\u2019 kept at Dell Quay in Chichester\
  \ Harbour, previously owned by OGA Member Max Manning. * There may have been a few\
  \ more 22s but the Tamarisk 24 is the most common version. See Tamarisk website\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.tamarisk-gaffers.co.uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"\
  _blank\"><u>www.tamarisk-gaffers.co.uk</u></a>.</p>\n<p>East Breeze was purchased\
  \ around 1993 by David and Helen Barr (who live near Chichester) from Maldon on\
  \ the Blackwater River on the East Coast. They sailed her from the east coast down\
  \ to Chichester Harbour and kept her at Langstone. They later kept her on a mooring\
  \ at Itchenor and had her in Birdham Pool one winter.</p>\n<p>The Barrs sailed her\
  \ a lot until their two daughters were born. They once took her across to France\
  \ with two friends, taking 15 hours to get there and 22 to get back. After they\
  \ had the children, they found it more difficult to sail. East Breeze was put up\
  \ for sale and was ashore in Thornham Marina for some time, until John Hilsden bought\
  \ her in November 2002 in a dilapidated condition. The Barr family have recently\
  \ joined the OGA and now have a Drascombe lugger which they bring all the way to\
  \ YOGAFF. They were very interested to see East Breeze again when we met them at\
  \ Yogaff a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>Jon Hilsden had the engine rebuilt by John\
  \ Cutler the marine engineer, and then moved her to Cowes, Isle of Wight. He carried\
  \ out quite a lot of work, such as stripping out the interrior accommodation to\
  \ make it open plan, new running rigging, repairs to ply deck and glassing over\
  \ the side decks and cockpit seats, installing a Taylors heater. John Hilsden then\
  \ got a job in France, so he put East Breeze up for sale and moved her to Dolphin\
  \ Quay, Emsworth in 2004.</p>\n<p>John Hall bought East Breeze in March 2005. The\
  \ varnish and paintwork was in poor condition, arrangements for cleating the sheets\
  \ &amp; halyards were very basic and the interior unfinished, with no bunk cushions\
  \ and an ancient cooker. There was only one battery, so this was replaced and a\
  \ second battery added with a switch so that engine &amp; domestic electrical supply\
  \ is separate. In additional to painting and varnishing, John Hall has carried out\
  \ the following improvements:</p>\n<p>Finished new interior layout including a chart\
  \ table; replaced part of ply bulkhead and cabin side, new cockpit sole and bearers.\
  \ New bunk cushions with fabric covers. New Plastimo Neptune cooker; completely\
  \ new gas system with gas detector alarm; gas bottle moved to safer position on\
  \ foredeck. New Portapotti chemical toilet and tap for stainless steel sink bowl.\
  \ Installed GPS, replaced VHF radio. Halyards and sheets changed to non-stretch\
  \ multiplait, most blocks replaced in Tufnol with jammers for sheets. Pin-rail for\
  \ belaying halyards and a boom crutch. New canvas full length boat cover and small\
  \ vinyl cockpit cover.</p>\n<p>East Breeze has been sailed locally, either in Chichester\
  \ Harbour or over to Bembridge. Longer trips have been to Yogaff 3 times and various\
  \ harbours in the Solent.</p>\n<p>*Scandal has her own entry in the Boat Register\
  \ and is now located in France.</p>\n<p>Marion Shirley bought East Breeze from John\
  \ and Liz Hall in late 2011 and delivered her from Emsworth to her new mooring at\
  \ Kemps Quay in Southampton in March 2012. &nbsp;Marion adapted the rigging for\
  \ single handed sailing by leading the main halyards back to the cockpit and adding\
  \ &nbsp;jib blocks made by Tim Aspden. She replaced the anchor chain with multiplait\
  \ and reorganised the main sheet arrangement, reefing and running backstays. She\
  \ attended to all the rigging requirements of the 2012 insurance survey. Marion\
  \ sailed East Breeze to the Beaulieu River, Marchwood Yacht Club, Newtown Creek,\
  \ Island Harbour, Wootton Creek, Lymington, and Yarmouth.</p>\n<p>In 2013 Ian Macgillivray,\
  \ professional boat builder of Bluff\u2019s Quay, Southampton advised and assisted\
  \ in stripping and sheathing &nbsp;the foredeck. This was then painted with two\
  \ part polyurethane primer and International Toplac. He also replaced the starboard\
  \ side of the forecabin by means of a scarphe joint. The foredeck cleats were replaced\
  \ and fitted with cushions below decks and some fittings regalvanised. The bobstay\
  \ fittings were bolted rather than screwed to the boat. Ian also built the housing\
  \ allowing the bowsprit to be run in to the boat. Marion sailed East Breeze to Yarmouth,\
  \ Portsmouth and Bembridge. East Breeze was present at Cowes for the 50th anniversary\
  \ of the Old Gaffers Association.</p>\n<p>In spring 2014, Marion removed the quarter\
  \ round beading from cockpit and side decks and Ian continued the programme of rebuild\
  \ and improvement by removing the cabin sides from East Breeze and peeling away\
  \ all the sheathing from side decks and cockpit. Considerable water ingress and\
  \ rot was discovered. The port side deck was totally replaced as were the cockpit\
  \ and cabin sides, all the cockpit flat areas, the stern deck, the bridge deck,\
  \ starboard and stern inwhales and internal sternpost. Teak corner posts were added\
  \ in the cock pit and forward and aft in the cabin. The cabin roof, side decks,\
  \ stern deck and cockpit flats were sheathed and repainted with two part epoxy primer\
  \ and two part top coat. A new locker was constructed and tiling added to allow\
  \ the installation of a Taylor\u2019s diesel heater, the water supply relocated\
  \ to below the chart table and the boat completely rewired with new batteries, cabin\
  \ lights, log and echo sounder, an additional mini-contest compass and 12v sockets.\
  \ Tufnell winches were installed and all works required and recommended by the 2012\
  \ insurance survey were completed. Spinlock jammers were installed to aid luff tension.</p>\n\
  <p>Marion sailed East Breeze to the Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival then to the OGA\
  \ Bembridge Rally and onwards, single handed, to the Dutch Old Gaffers Cross Country\
  \ Tour, crossing the Channel from Dover to Dunkerque. She sailed 809 nautical miles\
  \ in total and was away just under two months, crossing back from Dunkerque to Dover\
  \ and on to Brighton and East Cowes in an engine assisted passage.</p>\n<p>The original\
  \ engine, a Yanmar SE8 gave trouble on this voyage by not starting when warm and\
  \ was found to have a cracked cylinder head, probably due to intake of particles\
  \ which impeded water supply for cooling. A replacement head was sourced and fitted\
  \ for the 2015 season. In this season, Marion sailed East Breeze to the Yarmouth\
  \ Old Gaffers Festival, the Gaffers' Poole Rally and the Annual Rally at Cowes and\
  \ Haslar. Also to Ryde and on a week's tour of creeks and rivers of The Solent taking\
  \ in the Beaulieu River, Newtown, Newport, Wootton and Haslar.</p>\n<p>In March\
  \ 2016, East Breeze was once again at Bluff's Quay. Ian removed the starboard side\
  \ cockpit upright and floor, and the YSE8 engine. Marion cleaned and painted the\
  \ bilges prior to the installation of a Beta 14 engine and replacement of the wooen\
  \ parts including a cockpit floor and hatch.</p>\n<p>Marion sailed East Breeze to\
  \ the Medina River and then in stormy conditions under three reefs to the Yarmouth\
  \ Gaffers regatta. About two weeks later, Marion and East Breeze left the Solent\
  \ via Yarmouth, sailed to Alderney, on to Guernsey and thence to Treguier. They\
  \ continued by way of Perros Guirec, Roscoff, L'Aberwrach and Isle Molene to Camaret\
  \ where crew Mary Gibbs joined the ship. They continued to the Brest Festival and\
  \ onwards to the Douarnenez festival, suffering a collapse of the backstays and\
  \ gaff halyard. This was replaced at Douarnenez with help from Janet and Mike Gurney\
  \ in Passager. Marion, Mary and East Breeze returned via Camaret to L'Aberwrach,\
  \ Roscoff and Morlaix where Mary left by train to rejoin her own ship. Marion continued\
  \ to Trebeurden, the Treguier River, Pontrieux and Lezardrieux before crossing the\
  \ channel to Guernsey, Alderney and Yarmouth prior to joining a the Solent Gaffers\
  \ in the Beaulieu River at Ginns Farm.</p>\n<p>In 2017 following routine maintenance,\
  \ and the customary early season Solent Gaffers events, Marion sailed East Breeze\
  \ to The Folly and on to Weymouth. She crossed Lyme Bay to the River Exe, spent\
  \ a night on a buoy and then visited Topsham. She sailed by way of Brixham to Dartmouth,\
  \ anchoring in the river and leaving East Breeze in Dartmouth whilst joining the\
  \ Classic Channel Regatta. She rejoined East Breeze and sailed her to Salcombe and\
  \ then to Fowey, returning to Plymouth to explore the harbour and Tamar River before\
  \ joining the Gaffers Sou b' Sou' West Rally at Plymouth. She sailed in company\
  \ to Salcombe and back to Dartmouth, visiting Totnes in rain and cold before joining\
  \ the South West Gaffers Dittisham Rally. She then returned in company to Weymouth\
  \ and to Yarmouth. The passage to Yarmouth was windier than forecast and East Breeze's\
  \ mainsail disintegrated en route. Marion met former owners, the Barrs, in Yarmouth\
  \ and enjoyed discussing the history of repairs and improvements to East Breeze.\
  \ In late September, Marion sailed East Breeze to Lymington where she was measured\
  \ for a new main by Pete Sanders who confirmed that the damaged sail was the original\
  \ at 40+ years old. Marion made a new winter cover for East Breeze in late 2017.</p>\n\
  <p>Following maintenance, the addition of mast storage gear made by David Pennison\
  \ and with a new mainsail, Marion gave up her berth in Southampton. 2018 sailing\
  \ began on Friday 25th May when Marion joined Sally and Tony on Step Back in Time\
  \ for a pre-Yarmouth cruise to the Folly, Bucklers Hard and Lymington Town Quay.\
  \ Following the Yarmouth festival, Marion anchored at Alum Bay to take the new ebb\
  \ to Weymouth. This year, the trip west was quick with stops in Weymouth, round\
  \ the Bill to West Bay, thence to Dartmouth, Newton Ferrars and straight to Falmouth.\
  \ Here the competitors in the revived Golden Globe race were preparing their boats.\
  \ East Breeze shared a pontoon with iconic single handers Suhaili with RKJ on board\
  \ and Gypsy Moth 4 and saw the competitors depart for France and the start of the\
  \ race proper. Marion took East Breeze up the Fal and dried out in Truro then attended\
  \ the SW Gaffers Helford Rally with Richard Shirley. She retreated to Porthnavas\
  \ Creek and Gweek during bad weather then visited Fowey, Dandy Hole and Mayflower\
  \ Marina before joining the SW Gaffers again at Plymouth Yacht Haven. She returned\
  \ to Fowey for the Classics then took East Breeze up the Tamar to Calstock and a\
  \ temporary mooring. On 30th July, Marion slipped Calstock and returned to Dartmouth\
  \ via Mayflower Marina. Marion slipped Dartmouth at 0925 hrs on 01 August, moored\
  \ in Portland Marina at 2110 hrs continued to Newtown, arriving back at The Folly\
  \ on Friday, 3rd August. East Breeze was in Haslar Marina on Sunday 6th August,\
  \ returning to The Folly in convoy with Molly Cobbler. The OGA55 small boat and\
  \ main celebrations followed and East Breeze had a major professional engine service.</p>\n\
  <p>On 22 August, she was back in Weymouth where Marion was joined by Mike Forwood.\
  \ East Breeze left Weymouth at 0100 hours on 28th August, passed east of Alderney\
  \ through the early race and berthed on the visitors' pontoon in Guernsey at 1950\
  \ hours, a 91 mile motor assisted passage. Marion and Mike anchored at Beauport\
  \ in Jersey and continued to St Malo, Port des bas Sables. From 2nd September, Mike\
  \ and Marion transited the Canal d\u2019Ille et Rance, dropping the mast at Dinan\
  \ and stopping at Evran, Tinteniac (8 locks), St Medard (20 locks), St Martin (Rennes),\
  \ St Cyr (Rennes) - not recommended, Gaileau, Guipry, Besle. They arrived at Redon,\
  \ visitors\u2019 pontoon on Tuesday, 11th September where East Breeze was lifted\
  \ out and stored. About 889 miles achieved.</p>"
