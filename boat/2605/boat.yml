short_description: <p>A Carra 16 design that has been totally rebuilt as a day boat
  that can be used for occasional nights on board.</p>
full_description: When the first owner gave up sailing, he donated the already deteriorating
  boat to the sailing club. The current owner bought her as a bare hull mouldering
  with sails from the club. He completely rebuilt her to his own design, but keeping
  the original rig designed by John Shuttleworth, in 2002 and relaunched in 2003.
  She is a day boat that allows up to 3 people to occasionally sleep aboard.
