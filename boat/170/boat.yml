full_description: "<p>&#39;Nercissa&#39; is believed to be a fishing boat with a two-masted\
  \ lug rig, decked from the stem to the mainmast, probably working in the Plymouth\
  \ area when built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She moved to Ramsgate in 1928, was changed to a\
  \ sloop and had an engine fitted. She was later owned by a Mr C Corrie of Rochester.\
  \ She laid derelict with the tide running through her for nearly seven years in\
  \ Blue Boar Creek before she was rescued by Mr J Harding in 1956 who managed to\
  \ get her afloat and partially converted to a yacht.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being purchased\
  \ by R.A. Rush she had a major restoration, replacing the deck, coach roof and transom.\
  \ He re-engined her and re-rigged her as a gaff cutter and got her sailing again\
  \ in July 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had another new engine in 1997 and was sold to\
  \ Steve Finch in 2011, since when she has been out of the water for a major overhaul.</p>"
