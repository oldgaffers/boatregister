  Commissioned on the birth of his first child, and named after grandfather Jack
  Holt, Cunard's choice Southampton Trinity House pilot and member of the Master
  Mariners club. The Club is called 'The Cachalots' after the whale as they had
  the thickest skins and spouted a lot!


  'Cachalot Jack', the family boat, was intended to be the tender when times were
  flush and primary craft when things were tough or events dictated, but always
  loved.


  Great fun in a small package which introduced the children to boating.
