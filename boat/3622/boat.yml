full_description: |-
  Razor is sort of a mystery, pulled out of a hedge on St Marys, Isles of Scilly,
  work is being carried out to bring her back to her full glory (looks wise), but,
  she is being sailed every season and sailing well! She is Heard Tosher 18, year
  of build is unknown and there is no HIN on the hull that is visible, there is a
  plaque on the bulkhead saying ‘Barry Philpot Boatbuilder’ who owned Bryher
  Boatyard years ago so she must have come ashore here before for some work;
  current owner working at same boatyard on Bryher now!
