full_description: '<p><em>Sea Dog</em> has been in Cork Ireland since the early 1960''s.
  Owned by Stanley Roche in Ireland first we think, then by various families and groups
  around Cork Harbour and Kinsale. The Hillyard club reckon she was built with extra
  keel for racing.</p>

  <p>The current owner bought her in 2021 on the dry in Kinsale boat yard. A lot of
  work was done by George Kingston there and the hull seems fine apart form a damaged
  board at the heads outlet.</p>

  <p>She has been dug into a field to make her easier to work on as she is 2.4m from
  keel to rail. The superstructure all needs doing hence the location and the dig.
  She sits in a shale bed surrounded by 15mm gravel so it free drains. Hopefully that
  will keep her from rotting. She is covered up to the gunnels to stop the sun totally
  drying her out.</p>

  <p>Repairs should be finished by mid 2023 when the owner hopes to get a mooring
  in Wicklow or Arklow. He is looking to sail her around Ireland and to UK. She will
  be a family sailer and a boat to get away from life when needed.</p>'
