full_description: |-
  Surrounded by white plastic boats of all descriptions, Tara stands out, and
  poses regualrly for photographs! This small day sailer enjoys the predictable
  winds of the Mediterrean and her shallow draft takes us to many secluded
  beaches. Our season runs from April, if the Mistral has died away, and then ends
  in late September. That said October can be a superb month, for a gentle day
  sail, if she has not been hauled out by then.
