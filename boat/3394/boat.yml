full_description: "<p>&#39;Essex Melody&#39; is a 23&#39; JOG Bermudian yacht, designed\
  \ and built by John Scarlett in 1969. John was an electrical engineer working at\
  \ Marconi in Chelmsford and he built this boat as an academic challenge based on\
  \ the 20&#39; &#39;Sopranino&#39;, a famous little offshore racer which inspired\
  \ many young men in 1952 by being sailed across the Atlantic by Colin Mudie and\
  \ Patrick Ellam. It was whilst he was &nbsp;building &#39;Essex Melody&#39; at Maldon,\
  \ Essex that John became involved with the owners of old gaff boats being restored\
  \ in the same boatyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once he had completed &#39;Essex Melody&#39;\
  \ he put all his energies into initiating the link up between the South Coast and\
  \ East Coast Old Gaffers to form the Old Gaffers Association in 1963. &#39;Essex\
  \ Melody&#39; therefore played a significant role in the formation of the OGA as\
  \ we know it today. The first meetings were held in John&rsquo;s house in Maldon\
  \ and also at the Maldon Little Ship Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Rogers, East Coast\
  \ OGA member and training officer at Maldon Little Ship Club (MLSC), found this\
  \ classic Maldon-built 23-footer &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo; in 2008. She was in\
  \ a very dilapidated state, her covers blown off, sitting on an old trailer near\
  \ Newark. The full story of her history and remarkable connection with the OGA,\
  \ despite her Bermudan rig, may be found <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/rescuing-essex-melody-43426\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">in Practical Boat Owner, June 2016</a>. A few extracts and photos\
  \ from the article are reproduced here, with permission from PBO.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First\
  \ published in Gaffers Log, July, 2016</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We were taken\
  \ aback by the passion the current owners had for &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo;. She\
  \ had obviously given them hours of pleasure around the Trent, the Wash and north\
  \ Norfolk. They told us she was built by John Scarlett along the lines of the first\
  \ JOG (Junior Offshore Group) yacht &lsquo;Sopranino&rsquo;, and launched at Maldon\
  \ in 1959. They also informed us John was a member of MLSC and connected with the\
  \ OGA, which confused us somewhat as she is Bermudan-rigged!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John\
  \ Scarlett documented every hour spent building &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo;, and\
  \ took pictures at each stage of her construction. Finally, in September 1959, after\
  \ 3,581 hours&rsquo; work, she was launched from Dan Webb and Feesey&rsquo;s yard\
  \ in the presence of Eric Payne, Commodore of Marconi Sailing Club.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>With her extensive heritage background, &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo; was a\
  \ compelling case for a full restoration. We built a boatshed around her in our\
  \ garden in Maldon and she became our heritage project and a great source of local\
  \ interest. After 18 months of hard work and the help of many friends, &lsquo;Essex\
  \ Melody&rsquo; was taken to MarineStore and relaunched in the same place where\
  \ she was first launched in 1959. To celebrate, on 16 April, 2011, John Scarlett&rsquo;s\
  \ daughter and grandchildren poured champagne over the figurehead in the presence\
  \ of around 100 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo; is a unique example\
  \ of a JOG yacht: she certainly is a head-turner, and John Scarlett, first Secretary\
  \ of the OGA in 1963, seems to have got it right first time!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\
