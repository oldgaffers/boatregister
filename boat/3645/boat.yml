  Build as a nobby yacht in Overton on the river Lune, *Lady Anne* came second in
  the midnight race to the Isle of Man in 1928.


  In 1931 she sailed herself onto the beach by Fleetwood pier after her crew were
  lost at sea. She continued to sail in Morecambe Bay until 1939.


  In 1947 she was recorded as being at Clynder in the Gareloch by which time she
  had an engine.


  She has been sailed regularly in the Clyde up until 2021, having been in the
  same ownership for over 30 years.
