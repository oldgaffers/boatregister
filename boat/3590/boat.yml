full_description: "<p>In 1899 the decision was first made to adopt a new class of\
  \ boat for Hoylake Sailing Club. &nbsp;The gaff rigged, 16 foot clinker boats were\
  \ developed from a design by Captain Winchester, a club member, and built by Alex\
  \ Latta, also a club member and owner of a Smiths Bros boat yard. &nbsp;\u2018Opera\u2019\
  \ class racing commenced at Hoylake in June 1902. &nbsp;The fleet grew quickly to\
  \ 17 and has raced regularly since then. &nbsp;In 1909 \u2018Orchid\u2019 sailed\
  \ from Hoylake to Ardrossan and on to Ballycastle in Northern Ireland. &nbsp;14\
  \ boats of the \u2018Opera\u2019 class remain today in Hoylake with another \u2018\
  La Poupee\u2019 on display in the Merseyside Maritime Museum. &nbsp;The class has\
  \ therefore stood the test of time although some boats have been inevitably been\
  \ lost over intervening years.</p>"
