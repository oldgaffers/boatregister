  In 1899 the decision was first made to adopt a new class of
  boat for Hoylake Sailing Club. The gaff rigged, 16 foot clinker boats were
  developed from a design by Captain Winchester, a club member, and built by Alex
  Latta, also a club member and owner of a Smiths Bros boat yard. *Opera*
  class racing commenced at Hoylake in June 1902. The fleet grew quickly to
  17 and has raced regularly since then.
  
  In 1909 *Orchid* sailed from Hoylake to Ardrossan and on to Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.
  
  14 boats of the Opera class remain today in Hoylake with another, *La Poupee*
  on display in the Merseyside Maritime Museum. The class has
  therefore stood the test of time although some boats have been inevitably been
  lost over intervening years.
