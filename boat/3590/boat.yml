  In 1899 the decision was first made to adopt a new class of boat for Hoylake
  Sailing Club.  The lug rigged, 16 foot clinker boats were developed from a
  design by Captain Winchester, a club member, and built by Alex Latta, also a
  club member and owner of a Smiths Bros boat yard.  ‘Opera’ class racing
  commenced at Hoylake in June 1902.  The fleet grew quickly to 17 and has raced
  regularly since then.  In 1909 ‘Orchid’ sailed from Hoylake to Ardrossan and on
  to Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.  14 boats of the ‘Opera’ class remain today
  in Hoylake with another ‘La Poupee’ on display in the Merseyside Maritime
  Museum.  The class has therefore stood the test of time although some boats have
  been inevitably been lost over intervening years.
