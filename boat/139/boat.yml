full_description: "<p>Built in 1883 by William Hall as an oyster smack for the Petitt\
  \ family (oysterman), she was launched with fishing number CK139. She continued\
  \ to work as an oyster dredger, was registered as MN81, under power, as late as\
  \ the 1960s by the Keeble family, until they bought the Vanguard. Her current fishing\
  \ number is CK52.</p>\n<p>Kate has her channels on the bulwarks, peculiar to Paglesham\
  \ smacks, she also had an iron keelson, which allowed more headroom. She worked\
  \ under power for oyster dredging by the Keeble family at Paglesham as late as the\
  \ early 1960s, until they bought the \u2018Vanguard\u2019.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s,\
  \ Tim &amp; Ursula Balfour owned Kate, who later became sailmakers from Faversham,\
  \ was a silversmith who had a shop at Burnham. They bought her from Ron Bishop who\
  \ had swapped her the Bertha for her from Russell Pitt in Maldon c. 1965 and they\
  \ owned her until the early 1980s. Kate had a partial rebuild between 1972 and 1975.</p>\n\
  <p>Kate was owned by Mike Goodban until 2000 when she was towed from her mud berth\
  \ at Hollowshore to Mersea. Under new ownership her engine was removed and her deck\
  \ and spars were replaced before returning to Hollowshore in 2007 for a keel to\
  \ wale plank rebuild by Barry Tester. The iron keelson was replaced in wood at this\
  \ time.</p>\n<p>Extract from a newspaper cutting at her launch in 1883:</p>\n<p><em>During\
  \ last week, this little village put on an unusually new appearance. On Wednesday\
  \ the 6th inst, the numerous boats on the river were dressed \u2018fore to peak\u2019\
  \ with flags of the brightest hues and of every conceivable shape and colourin honour\
  \ of the wedding of Mr. John Rogers, junr. of Burnham; while on the following day\
  \ a beautiful little craft of 12 tons built by Mr. Hall for Mr. Z. Pettitt, was\
  \ successfuly launched. On the signal being given, the shores were knocked away,\
  \ and the \u2018Kate\u2019 (christened by her owner\u2019s little daughter) glided\
  \ gracefully from the stocks into her native element, amid the hearty cheers of\
  \ the numerous spectators.</em></p>\n<p>Kate is moored in West Mersea, alongside\
  \ the Ethel Alice &amp; Dorothy.</p>"
