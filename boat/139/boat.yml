full_description: |-
  Built in 1883 by William Hall as an oyster smack for the Petitt family
  (oysterman), she was launched with fishing number CK139. She continued to work
  as an oyster dredger, was registered as MN81, under power, as late as the 1960s
  by the Keeble family, until they bought the *Vanguard*. Her current fishing
  number is CK52.


  *Kate* has her channels on the bulwarks, peculiar to Paglesham smacks, she also
  had an iron keelson, which allowed more headroom. 


  In the 1960s, Tim & Ursula Balfour who owned *Kate* later became sailmakers from
  Faversham having previouly been silversmiths with a shop at Burnham. They bought
  her from Ron Bishop who had swapped her the *Bertha* for her from Russell Pitt
  in Maldon c. 1965 and they owned her until the early 1980s. *Kate* had a partial
  rebuild between 1972 and 1975.


  *Kate* was owned by Mike Goodban until 2000 when she was towed from her mud
  berth at Hollowshore to Mersea. Under new ownership her engine was removed and
  her deck and spars were replaced before returning to Hollowshore in 2007 for a
  keel to wale plank rebuild by Barry Tester. The iron keelson was replaced in
  wood at this time.


  Extract from a newspaper cutting at her launch in 1883:


  *During last week, this little village put on an unusually new appearance. On
  Wednesday the 6th inst, the numerous boats on the river were dressed ‘fore to
  peak’ with flags of the brightest hues and of every conceivable shape and
  colourin honour of the wedding of Mr. John Rogers, junr. of Burnham; while on
  the following day a beautiful little craft of 12 tons built by Mr. Hall for Mr.
  Z. Pettitt, was successfuly launched. On the signal being given, the shores were
  knocked away, and the ‘Kate’ (christened by her owner’s little daughter) glided
  gracefully from the stocks into her native element, amid the hearty cheers of
  the numerous spectators.*


  *Kate* is moored in West Mersea, alongside the *Ethel Alice* & *Dorothy*.
