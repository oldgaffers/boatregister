  \ a boatyard on the River Nar by Walter Worfolk. He had arrived from Stainforth\
  \ in Yorkshire with his young family the previous year, staying in Bridge Street\
  \ with his wife\u2019s uncle, William Lancaster. Walter already knew that Lynn did\
  \ not have a boat building company to service the fishing fleet and he put the skills\
  \ he learned in Stainforth to immediate use by building the 34ft Baden Powell for\
  \ Harry and William Cook, for \xA350.<p><p></td><p><p><td style=&#34;border-top-width:\

  \ is a double-ended cockling boat.\_ The Cooks were so pleased with the workmanship\
  \ that they gave Walter an extra fiver and presented his wife Lily with a cruet\
  \ set for the table. Walter\u2019s sons, Gerald (10) and William (8) at the time,\
  \ were soon apprenticed to their father and continued building wooden boats in Lynn\
  \ until 1981, when Gerald died.\_ William lived to just past his 100th birthday\
  \ in 1994."
