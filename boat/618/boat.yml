full_description: "<p>&#39;Bluebell&#39; is the original steel Bluewater 25, launched\
  \ as &#39;Jolly Jac&#39; and sometimes called Smuggler 25. The design is now known\
  \ as Tradewind Atoll 25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reviewed in the yachting press very favourably,\
  \ she is always a &#39;head turner&#39; and &#39;Bluebell&#39; gets admiring remarks\
  \ wherever she goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Found without a deck and coachroof in a barn,\
  \ she was rebuilt with two layers of 12mm marine ply topped with 20mm teak in 2014.\
  \ Sadly, the air cooled Ducati engine and electrics were damaged beyond repair in\
  \ 2016 and she was sold to new owners from Sandwich in 2017.</p>"
