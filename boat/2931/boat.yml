  sales_text: <p>"Gimli", a well cared for Memory 19, overall winner of the OGA Helford
    Regatta in 2017, is for sale. She is a fast boat with a distinguished racing history
    in the Solent before she came to Devon.</p><p>She is just launched onto her mooring
    on the Dart with a new coat of antifoul, having spent the winter in her barn under
    cover for the winter in Devon&nbsp;as she has been these last three years.&nbsp;</p><p>She
    has a two year old SBS galvanised&nbsp;trailer that has never been in salt water.
    She has always been launched by crane. Full set of sails including topsail, plus
    inboard outboard.&nbsp;More details to follow on request.</p>

full_description: <p>Epoxied below the waterline by the builders, Gimli carries a
  Tohatsu 6hp in a well. Her black hull with sand coloured decks, means she&rsquo;s
  a real head turner and sails beautifully. As Classic Boat said of another yacht,
  she is &lsquo;part of the modern tradition of fast, retro-styled daysailers&rsquo;,
  except that she&rsquo;s fine for weekending and indeed we have spent a week or more
  on board.</p>
