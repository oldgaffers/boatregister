short_description: <p>Memory 19 built by Salterns in 2009.</p>
full_description: <p>Epoxied below the waterline by the builders, Gimli carries a
  Tohatsu 6hp in a well. Her black hull with sand coloured decks, means she&rsquo;s
  a real head turner and sails beautifully. As Classic Boat said of another yacht,
  she is &lsquo;part of the modern tradition of fast, retro-styled daysailers&rsquo;,
  except that she&rsquo;s fine for weekending and indeed we have spent a week or more
  on board.</p>
