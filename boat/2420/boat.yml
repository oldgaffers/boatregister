    *Albion* is a project for someone.  The boat has been out of the water for the
    last 40 years, but work is ongoing with a fair portion of replacement planking
    (larch on an oak frame),  larch planking on deck and counterstern.   More
    recently the coach roof was added.


    *Albion* has a full set of sails, a 20 HP Buck engine (working condition
    unknown), original winches and other items shown in the photographs.  The name
    was changed from *Albion* to *Lively Lady* which was changed back to *Albion*.
