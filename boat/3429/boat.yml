generic_type: Yacht
rig_type: Cutter
mainsail_type: gaff
short_description: Built in ply, Hannah of Rock provided the mould for all subsequent
  mark 1 Cornish Crabbers.
full_description: The third of only four marine ply Cornish Crabbers, Hannah is the
  only one known to survive.<p> When Hannah of Rock was lifted out of the water at
  the end of 2019 it became apparent that the steel centre board was blown with a
  large amount of rust and needed repairing/replacing. The rudder bearing male and
  female parts, which had always been worn, had reached a stage that they would have
  to be repaired/renewed.  <p> She was bought by Felixstowe Boat Yard for restoration.  Once
  the repairs are done the boat should be a great purchase for someone interested
  in such a classic Gaff Rig.
