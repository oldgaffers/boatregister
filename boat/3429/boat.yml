short_description: Built in ply, Hannah of Rock provided the mould for all subsequent
  mark 1 Cornish Crabbers.
full_description: The third of only four marine ply Cornish Crabbers, Hannah is the
  only one known to survive.<p> When Hannah of Rock was lifted out of the water at
  the end of 2019 it became apparent that the steel centre board was blown with a
  large amount of rust and needed repairing/replacing. The rudder bearing male and
  female parts, which had always been worn, had reached a stage that they would have
  to be repaired/renewed.  <p> She was bought by Felixstowe Boat Yard for restoration.  Once
  the repairs are done the boat should be a great purchase for someone interested
  in such a classic Gaff Rig.

  sales_text: <p>A Cornish Crabber Mk1 CC3, built 1975, "Hannah of Rock" is the last
    of only four wooden crabbers ever built. She was used as the mould template for
    subsequent fibreglass hulls.</p><p>Following a stroke last year and four grandchildren
    it"s time to change to a larger boat. Over nine years of ownership based at Felixstowe
    Ferry on the River Deben we have enjoyed sailing the surrounding rivers and estuaries
    with a lifting centerboard able to enter even the Deben at any state of the tide.</p><p>During
    ownership we have made good the hull and all wooden parts which with continued
    care are good for another nine years. We have fitted a new Nanni Diesel N2.14
    10 HP (2012 with less than 100 hours) new mast, new sail&nbsp;(2013), new radio
    (2016), new wireless wind speed and direction (2017). She has a depth gauge and
    compass with all the usual kit; fenders, ropes, fire extinguishers, two anchors,
    auto steering attached to tiller, topsail and jackyard with&nbsp;associated wooden
    spars, complete stainless steel railing and cables (not fitted). There is a road
    trailer used to transport the boat from Falmouth, which is no longer road usable.</p><p>Presently
    afloat Bawdsey Quay.</p>
