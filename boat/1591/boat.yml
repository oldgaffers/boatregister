  Royal Yacht Squadron and the Island Sailing Club. Eilun, is still racing and

  Eilun went to France in 1908, where Lloyds Register records she was re-named
  Rosenn and remained on the Atlantic coast in various harbours until after the
  Great War. She returned to England in the Twenties and spent many years on or
  around the River Crouch.  At times she has chartered one notable charterer was
  John Profumo but used as a cruising boat. During her time on the Crouch, she
  underwent a major restoration her owner was a shipwright and was based up the
  river at Fambridge until she went on the market to allow her owner to purchase a
  boat more suited to long-distance cruising.


  In May 2007, Rosenn was purchased by Barry Dunning and Bob Fisher, who, as part
  of the purchasing deal, arranged for her to be brought from the Crouch to
  Lymington. It was at this point that Rosenn reverted from cruising boat to
  racing boat her new owners were more interested in that aspect of the sport and
  a gradual metamorphosis began.


  More recently she has been bought by Peter & Victoria Bonham Chritie and is
  currently racing succesfully in the Solent.
