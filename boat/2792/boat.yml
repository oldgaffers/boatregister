short_description: <p>&#39;Harvester&#39; is a North Norfolk Whelker, built by Emery
  of Sheringham in 1951, and restored by David Hewitt of Blakeney in 2001.</p>
full_description: Built for and fished by 'Custard' Cooper for 30 years, then by George
  Hewitt boatbuilder, his brother David restored her in 2001. She now has an 8' bowsprit
  instead of her dipping lug. She's an open boat with a cuddy in the bows and sailed
  from Norfolk to Holland and back,160 miles door to door, in 2006. Skipper Graeme
  Peart notes he fitted a radar as a precaution but felt it wasn't a bad passage for
  an open boat.
