full_description: |-
  Shoal Waters was built from the best hull available and completed in 1963 to
  owner Charles Stock's own design using gear from an old half-decker bought in
  1948. She took part in the 1st and 50th East Coast races.


  Over 70,000 nautical miles have been made good from Maldon between Whitby,
  Ostend and the Solent. Charles Stock wrote many books about his sailing
  activities and there are references to these on the boat's website.
