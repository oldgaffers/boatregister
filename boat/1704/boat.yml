full_description: "<p>&lsquo;Chough&rsquo; was designed by A R Luke of Hamble, built\
  \ by Brook &amp; Hall, Walton on the Naze in 1927.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brenda Page confirmed\
  \ that her grandfather built &#39;Chough&#39; at Brook &amp; Hall, Walton on the\
  \ Naze, for a Mr Charles Pearson. A Mr Algar owned her from 1927. &#39;Chough&#39;\
  \ spent the 2nd World War covered up in a mud berth. Mr Charles Pearson owned her\
  \ from the 1930s into the 1950s and Brenda Page has all the records that show what\
  \ her grandfather did to the boat during those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Charles\
  \ Pearson died it is thought she was then owned by Mr Charles Pledge, then by Mr\
  \ R.L.Broughton, in Lymington. Mr W.G.Stevenson owned her from 1970 to 1972 and\
  \ then she was owned by Mr Brooks. Mr Cundall of Newport, Isle of Wight, owned her\
  \ and was active in the Solent area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sold her in 1980 and subsequently\
  \ she appeared on the back cover of the OGA newsletter 1989/3 with a request as\
  \ to where she was. It turned out she was ashore from 1980 when Noel Peck bought\
  \ her. He sold her to Sid Fisher of Brixham. Sid carried out work on the hull and\
  \ deck and her new owners David and Christine Hopkins gave her a new rig and carried\
  \ out more work in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Chough&rsquo; has a good racing record\
  \ having won many Solent OGA races including Cowes Classic Class Winner 2014 and\
  \ 2015.</p>"
