full_description: |-
  ‘Chough’ was designed by A R Luke of Hamble, built by Brook & Hall,
  Walton-on-the-Naze in 1927.


  Brenda Page confirmed that her grandfather built 'Chough' at Brook & Hall,
  Walton on the Naze, for a Mr Charles Pearson. A Mr Algar owned her from 1927.
  'Chough' spent the 2nd World War covered up in a mud berth. Mr Charles Pearson
  owned her from the 1930s into the 1950s and Brenda Page has all the records that
  show what her grandfather did to the boat during those years.


  When Charles Pearson died it is thought she was then owned by Mr Charles Pledge,
  then by Mr R.L.Broughton, in Lymington. Mr W.G.Stevenson owned her from 1970 to
  1972 and then she was owned by Mr Brooks. Mr Cundall of Newport, Isle of Wight,
  owned her and was active in the Solent area.


  He sold her in 1980 and subsequently she appeared on the back cover of the OGA
  newsletter 1989/3 with a request as to where she was. It turned out she was
  ashore from 1980 when Noel Peck bought her. He sold her to Sid Fisher of
  Brixham. Sid carried out work on the hull and deck and her new owners David and
  Christine Hopkins gave her a new rig and carried out more work in 2013.


  ‘Chough’ has a good racing record having won many Solent OGA races including
  Cowes Classic Class Winner 2014 and 2015.
