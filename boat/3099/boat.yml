full_description: Songbird is an Heir Island sloop, the last of 23 built so far. Most
  of them are based in Baltimore, Eire but I understand there is one in Poole Harbour.
  The first 22 were all built in west Cork and Songbird was the beginning and I believe
  the end of the designer's collaboration with the Devonians. She is not, strictly,
  a lobster boat but a recreational vessel developed from the traditional lines.
