full_description: <p>&#39;An Old Gaffer&#39;s Tale&#39;, first published in 1981,
  tells the story of Martin Eve&#39;s acquisition and ownership of Privateer and makes
  an excellent read. Privateer had a dramatic maiden voyage, when she was almost lost
  off the Norfolk coast, and plied the East Coast of England from Orford to the Humber
  in all weathers. She took charter passages as far afield as Finland and Genoa.</p>
