short_description: |-
  Privateer has been described as a 'traditional old gaffer', built in 1931 as a
  fishing smack and later converted to a yacht at the boatyard in Boston.
full_description: |-
  'An Old Gaffer's Tale', first published in 1981, tells the story of Martin Eve's
  acquisition and ownership of Privateer and makes an excellent read. Privateer
  had a dramatic maiden voyage, when she was almost lost off the Norfolk coast,
  and plied the East Coast of England from Orford to the Humber in all weathers.
  She took charter passages as far afield as Finland and Genoa.
