short_description: <p>Nick Skeates&#39; 35&#39; Wylo II design built in steel between

  2009 at Shoreham.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Amanita&#39; is named for a family of mushrooms, we wanted\
  \ a mushroom name as she was built by Mike Hill on a derelict mushroom farm at Thakeham,\
  \ W. Sussex. The build started in 2003, she was launched first in 2007 as an empty\
  \ shell, to check for leaks (and so we could have a party!) and as a workable boat\
  \ in 2009 (another party!), she has been a sailing building site ever since.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She is a Nick Skeates&#39; Wylo II design, the long version. Initially\
  \ the mast was stepped through and a fidded topmast was carried but this was changed\
  \ to the standard, deck stepped, in a tabernacle, in 2012. Initially based in Shoreham,\
  \ later moving to Chichester, she has sailed as far West as Yarmouth, I.o.W.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Summer 2015 saw &#39;Amanita&#39; mixing it with the Luggers in Cornwall!\
  \ The lure of the cream tea is now a constant siren song, calling us westward once\
  \ more . . .</p>"
