full_description: "<p>Originally built for Oystering on the Crouch, possibly for a&nbsp;Mr\
  \ Deval. When the business failed Pym&nbsp;moved to Brightlingsea as a trawler.\
  \ Her name was changed by her new owner Chris Scott to Anita. his wife&#39;s name.\
  \ He kept her for 30 years and put in a new engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005 Anita\
  \ was bought by Brian Kennell and his wife Sally, and over the next 6 years she\
  \ was reconfigured&nbsp;into a comfortable cruiser. In this guise she has cruised\
  \ extensively, visiting the tidal and non-tidal Thames as far as Lechlade, the Norfolk\
  \ Broads, and the Kennett and Avon canal all the way to Bristol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anita\
  \ is a versatile boat capable of coastal cruising, but with a demountable wheelhouse\
  \ to enable her to pass under bridges with as little as 6&#39; headroom.</p>"
