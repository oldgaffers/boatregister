full_description: "Originally built for Oystering on the Crouch, possibly for a\_\
  Mr Deval. When the\nbusiness failed Pym\_moved to Brightlingsea as a trawler. Her\
  \ name was changed by\nher new owner Chris Scott to Anita. his wife's name. He kept\
  \ her for 30 years\nand put in a new engine.\n\n\nIn 2005 Anita was bought by Brian\
  \ Kennell and his wife Sally, and over the next\n6 years she was reconfigured\_\
  into a comfortable cruiser. In this guise she has\ncruised extensively, visiting\
  \ the tidal and non-tidal Thames as far as Lechlade,\nthe Norfolk Broads, and the\
  \ Kennett and Avon canal all the way to Bristol.\n\n\nAnita is a versatile boat\
  \ capable of coastal cruising, but with a demountable\nwheelhouse to enable her\
  \ to pass under bridges with as little as 6' headroom.\n\n"

    "Anita" was built in 1972 on the River Crouch as an oyster dredger. Built of
    iroko on oak and designed by Watson. Bought by the current owners in 2005 out of
    fishing and converted into a comfortable and versatile cruiser over a number of
    years.

    Cruised around the Thames Estuary and to the navigable head of the Thames, the
    Norfolk Broads and through the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bristol. 5 berths in two
    cabins. New 50hp Beta engine in 2012 and most ancillary equipment new in the
    last 10 years. Hot water system and cabin heating.

    A well maintained boat ready to go, suitable for coastal cruising and inland
    waterways of Great Britain and Europe.
