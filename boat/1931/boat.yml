  sales_text: <p>"Nutmeg" is a Sea Otter 18, beautifully designed and built by David
    Moss. This outstanding gaff rigged yawl is in excellent condition and has been
    featured in all the major classic and wooden boat magazines. She is easy to sail
    single handed, very close winded and by far the most beautiful for her size and
    class!</p><p>"Nutmeg" is easily maintained and can be dry stored in the average
    garage on her yard trolley. Recently feature on video by "My Classic Boat".</p><p>A
    reluctant sale, but a rare opportunity to purchase a future baby classic at a
    very reasonable price.</p>
