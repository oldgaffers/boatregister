 *Freda* was moulded from the *Sir William Priestley* the Morecambe Bay Prawner
 Association lifeboat.
full_description: |-
 *Freda* was built in 1989 using a mould taken from the Morecambe
 Fishermans Association lifeboat, *Sir William Priestley*, built by William and
 Fred Crossfield in 1934. She was a prototype for a Freda Class of yachts, based
 on this design.
 
 *Sir William Priestley* was the Morecambe Fisherman’s
 private lifeboat built by William Crossfield & Sons in 1934. Lady Priestley
 donated the money in memory of her husband, a Bradford mill owner, MP and supporter
 of the RNLI. Sir William had been involved in fundraising for the Spurn Head
 lifeboat 'City of Bradford II'. Morecambe was popular with holidaymakers from
 Bradford and was often known as 'Bradford by the Sea'. The naming of the 'Sir
 William Priestley' was attended by the Lord Mayors of Bradford and Leeds and
 she was paraded through the streets of Morecambe and Heysham watched by 20,000
 people.
 
 Six or more replicas have been made of the *Sir William Priestley*
 in glass fibre using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric Bergqvist,
 a Cheshire boatbuilder in return for royalties of £25 for every boat built.
 The *Sir William Priestley* was retired from service in 1987 and taken to Lancaster 
 Maritime Museum to await restoration.
 
 Built and fitted out by Classic Yachts of Southampton who purchased Eric Bergqvist's
 original *Freda* and another of the hulls from the mould he had made. *Freda* was 
 exibited at the 1989 Southampton Boat Show to much acclaim. She was also displayed at the Lancaster Maritime Museum
 for some time. The class is named after Eric Bergqvist's wife, Freda but no further
 boats were built.
