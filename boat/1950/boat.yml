  *Chione T*'s hull was moulded by Blondecell Marine of Lymington before being
  fitted out to her first owner's specification by Martyn Brake Yachts, Poole. 
  She is a solidly constructed and sturdy gaff cutter with a lot of accommodation
  space for her size.  Her British Racing Green hull makes her stand out.  Having
  spent several years on Loch Craignish on the west coast of Scotland, she
  returned to the Solent in 2018, and then moved to Plymouth in 2020.  She is now
  berthed in King Point Marina.

    *Chione* is a Tradewind Atoll, a traditional gaff rigged cutter which punches
    well above her weight for a boat of just over 25’ on deck in terms of both
    sailing ability and accommodation.  *Chione* has only had two owners from new
    and when she was commissioned in 1998 she was built by Blondcell Marine and
    fitted-out by Martyn Brake to very high standards. 


    Offering accommodation for a crew of 4, *Chione* has been well thought out for
    family cruising.  She provides generously proportioned berths, a separate heads
    compartment, dedicated chart table, galley with 2 burner gas stove, grill and
    oven, Origo marincool fridge, Eberspacher heating, 60ltr stainless steel fuel
    tank, 135ltr freshwater tank, heads holding tank (heads can also discharge
    overboard), a Yanmar 2GM20F diesel engine with shaft drive to 3-blade fixed
    prop, shore power system, Lewmar anchor windlass, Simrad instruments, Garmin
    GPS, VHF, stereo, and a TP300 tiller pilot.  The bowsprit can be retracted
    easily.  *Chione* has been maintained ashore annually and benefits from a new
    mast (Collars – 2022), Victron shore-power battery charger (2023), Coppercoat
    antifoul (professionally applied during 2024) and a new mainsail cover (2024).


    Still in immaculate condition below and good condition on deck, *Chione* has
    only been lightly used and is a lovely example of this robust class of gaffer
