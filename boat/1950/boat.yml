full_description: |-
  *Chione T*'s hull was moulded by Blondecell Marine of Lymington before being
  fitted out to her first owner's specification by Martyn Brake Yachts, Poole. 
  She is a solidly constructed and sturdy gaff cutter with a lot of accommodation
  space for her size.  Her British Racing Green hull makes her stand out.  Having
  spent several years on Loch Craignish on the west coast of Scotland, she
  returned to the Solent in 2018, and then moved to Plymouth in 2020.  She is now
  berthed in King Point Marina.
