full_description: 41 TM, She was kept in Mengeham Rythe, Hayling where my wife's family
  lived. Her father, Ralph Fisher (then a LT Cmdr RN) sailed Viking. She went on several
  of the earliest Fastnets with apparently John Illingworth as a fore deck hand on
  the first.  She broke her moorings at spring tide during a SW gale in December 1928,
  survived several weeks on the Winner (where she dug a hole for herself, only floating
  at springs) and sprung her 13" diameter solid pine mast during another SW gale.  A
  channel was eventually dug to try to refloat her with the help of some 70 sailors
  from Portsmouth. That didnt work and it was nearly Easter before they got her 'off'.
