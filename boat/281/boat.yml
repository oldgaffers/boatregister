full_description: |-
  *Polly* was one of the small oyster smacks built by John Howard of Maldon. She
  was originally built with a transom stern, of the normal pine on oak
  construction, with a small cuddy forward of the mast and fish hold, below the
  main deck aft of the mast.

  In 1919 she was extended to 33 foot by the addition of the counter stern, which
  was built by Cooke in his barge yard at the other end of Maldon Town Quay from
  Howard's old yard (then being run by Dan Webb). Until 1955 she was fishing out
  of Maldon with the Pitt family. Of all the Maldon and Brightlingsea smacks which
  lay on the bank of the Blackwater below the quay, *Polly* was the only one
  without an engine in the early 1950s. In those days, it was often said that the
  fact she had never been subjected to the strains and vibrations of an engine
  resulted in her fastenings being in much better condition than any of the other
  boats. As Wally and Ernie Pitt had only the sails to propel them up and down the
  Blackwater, her running rigging was easily the best in the fleet. Wally and
  Ernie were a familiar sight on the river, often beating up to their mooring
  early on the flood, tacking up the narrow channel without saying a word.

  *Polly* missed the first East Coast Old Gaffers race, 1963, but Ian Edmond
  brought her along in 1964. He sailed a very nice race in a light breeze to be
  the first winner of the Tom Bolton Memorial Cup for the first fishing or
  ex-fishing boat over the finishing line. In this, Ian was helped by the
  relatively large sail area and very fine, unusually long run aft. First

  note: In 1955 Wally and Ernie Pitt decided they were getting too old to carry on
    fishing and sold 'Polly' to John Kemp of Heybridge, who, in turn, sold her to
    Ian Edmond in 1960. In 1966, Ian sold 'Polly' to a Mr Williams of Brightllingsea.
