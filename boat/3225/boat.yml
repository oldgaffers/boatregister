full_description: "*Windhover* is an original wooden Drascombe Lugger, the 3rd built\
  \ by John\nElliott under his own name after building 65 at Kelly and Hall.\_\n\n\
  The earliest Luggers were built from 1968 onwards at Kelly and Hall\u2019s yard\
  \ in\nsouth Devon by John and Doug Elliott, who later bought the rights and set\
  \ up\nunder their own name. Luggers were mainly built by John, who sadly died after\
  \ a\nfew years, but Doug who surveyed *Windhover* in 2013 estimates that she was\n\
  built in 1973, the third built under their own name, and is the 68th wooden\nLugger.\n\
