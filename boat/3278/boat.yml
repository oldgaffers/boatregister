full_description: "<p>&#39;Naida&#39; was built by her firstst owner starting in 1999,\
  \ finishing in 2011. 95% of the timber came from within a mile of where she was\
  \ built, most of it coming from trees that were brought down by the &#39;Great Storm&#39;\
  \ of October 1987. She has no imported timber in her construction. Designed by Paul\
  \ Fisher, she is based on the &#39;Pinky Ketches&#39; of the19th century on East\
  \ Coast of the USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was launched into the River Thames in 2011,\
  \ and motored down to London where she was rigged. Her maiden voyage was to the\
  \ Isles of Scilly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"\
