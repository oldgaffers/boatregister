full_description: "<p><em>Bryony</em> is understood to have been built as a yacht\
  \ for a &nbsp;Dutchman who brought her to the UK where she has lived ever since.\
  \ &nbsp;&nbsp;She &nbsp;was registered as <em>Heemschipp II </em>in Holland but\
  \ was registered in Bristol as <em>Quetzal</em> in 1953. &nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Buckell\
  \ found <em>Quetzal </em>at &nbsp;Elephant Boatyard in a decayed state in 1986 and\
  \ rebuilt her. &nbsp;&nbsp;Many &nbsp;thought that the restoration was impossible,\
  \ but Arthur proved his work a &nbsp;success as he plucked another boat off the\
  \ shore at Yogaff in foul &nbsp;conditions, winning a well-deserved seamanship prize\
  \ for his selfless efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;He used her as a live aboard, and sailed\
  \ many miles in her.</p>\n<p>In &nbsp;2002 Arthur felt unable to do her justice\
  \ anymore, and sold her to Ken Perry who gave her a four year refit before re-launching\
  \ her in &nbsp;2007. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Ken Perry fell ill and\
  \ by the time the current &nbsp;owner found her in 2013, she was again in need of\
  \ a 4-year refit! &nbsp;&nbsp;As &nbsp;the new owner lived a long way from the sea\
  \ in darkest Herefordshire, &nbsp;<em>Quetzal</em> had a trip on a low-loader and\
  \ a lift from a very large crane &nbsp;over the hedge into the owner\u2019s garden.&nbsp;</p>\n\
  <p>There she received a lot of &nbsp;TLC from the owner, his helpful neighbours\
  \ and a talented young &nbsp;boatbuilder from Lowestoft. &nbsp;&nbsp;She also benefited\
  \ from the advice of &nbsp;Arthur, who was still interested to hear about the boat\
  \ and shared an &nbsp;album of photos, both of the work he had done and then of\
  \ the boat under &nbsp;sail.</p>\n<p>During this time she changed name again to\
  \ <em>Bryony</em>, &nbsp;after the owner's 19 year-old god-daughter who drowned\
  \ while surfing in &nbsp;Thailand on the way back from an oceanography project in\
  \ Cambodia. She packed so much into her short life that the owner was inspired to\
  \ &nbsp;\u201Cget on with it\u201D and complete the project. The matter was finally\
  \ &nbsp;decided when the owner's gardening book told him that Bryony is of no use\
  \ &nbsp;in the garden.</p>\n<p>She was re-launched in July 2017 and is now based\
  \ in Saltash.</p>"
