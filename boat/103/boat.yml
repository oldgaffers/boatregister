full_description: "<p>&#39;Jan Mayen&#39; is a 29&#39; motorsailor built from iroko\
  \ on oak frames with pitch-pine bottom boards. She is a strong boat. In previous\
  \ ownerships she has cruised as far north as Spitzbergen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ 2014 - 15 &#39;Jan Mayen&#39; underwent a major refurbishment to her interior\
  \ with a new beta 43 engine, new electrics, calorifier, WC, refrigerator and Taylor&#39;s\
  \ diesel heater. A new furling jib was also added. Her superstructure has been stripped\

  \ added with a hatch to access tender storage below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based in the\
  \ Solent, she has cruised the South Coast to Falmouth, the Channel Islands and North\
  \ Brittany.</p>"
