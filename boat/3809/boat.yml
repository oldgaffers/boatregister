  *Helen 11* is a wooden fishing boat and was built in 1910 by Crossfields.  Conwy
  was the home of John Crossfields’ boat building enterprise, which extended to a
  number of locations along the coast of North Wales and Lancashire. They would
  often travel up and down the coast building boats on the beach for people, and
  it is said that they would produce a boat in six weeks, using timber sourced
  near the site and with only 6-7 men. These boats are called Nobbys, which is a
  colloquial word for rough wood, but they are identifiable by their sleek lines,
  low freeboard and beautiful counter stern. They are also called Prawners as that
  was the catch for subsistence fishermen and they were built for speed to get the
  catch back to harbour and achieve the best price for the freshest fish. Their
  low freeboard allowed the men to haul in the nets, with their bare hands, just
  using the roll of the boat in the sea. They only had the use of their sails,
  with topsails for light winds, to get home, as engines were not fitted until the
  1930’s.  

  ​Before arriving at Conwy, the boat was previously owned by the Roddick family
  who are great enthusiasts of the Nobby class boat.  They have generously donated
  the boat to the Community of Conwy in memory of Jamie Roddick who tragically
  died of cancer at the age of 34.  
  *Helen II* was constructed for George E Stonall of New Brighton.  She is 40 feet
  long and of oak frame and pitch pine construction.  As well as being a working
  boat, she also has a long history of successful racing awards. In 1914, she was
  the RMYA regatta winner in the fishing boat class and in 1920, the winner of the
  Liverpool Yacht club regatta. In the December 1930, the Helen II went missing as
  a result of a storm in Liverpool bay.  She was eventually rescued from the
  Queens channel, with the help of a New Brighton lifeboat and was subsequently
  purchased by Ludwick Anderson of Port Maddog. She spent the next 10 years in
  waters off the welsh coast, around  Port Maddog and Bangor.  In 1943, she was
  purchased by Jackie Martin of Fleetwood and worked off the Lancashire coast
  under various owners until 1999 when she was acquired by the Community of Conwy.
