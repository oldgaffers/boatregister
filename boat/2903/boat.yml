full_description: 'In the year 2000, Liam and Nigel recovered from a mud bank the
  remains of an 1893 Heir Island lobster boat, the "Honora". From "Honora''s" authentic
  and unique lines three new boats have been built, and a fourth is under construction
  at Hegarty''s yard. Nigel Towse is lovingly and accurately restoring the "Honora"
  at his premises on Sherkin Island. The history of these boats is documented by maritime
  historian Cormac Levis in "Towelsail Yawls: the Lobsterboats of Heir Island and
  Roaringwater Bay" (Galley Head Press, 2002).'
