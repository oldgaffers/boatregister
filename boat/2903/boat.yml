full_description: "In the year 2000, Liam and Nigel recovered from a mud bank the\
  \ remains of an 1893 Heir Island lobster boat, the \"Honora\". From \"Honora's\"\
  \ authentic and unique lines three new boats have been built, and a fourth is under\
  \ construction at Hegarty's yard. Nigel Towse is lovingly and accurately restoring\
  \ the \"Honora\" at his premises on Sherkin Island. The history of these boats is\
  \ documented by maritime historian Cormac Levis in \"Towelsail Yawls: the Lobsterboats\
  \ of Heir Island and Roaringwater Bay\" (Galley Head Press, 2002)."
