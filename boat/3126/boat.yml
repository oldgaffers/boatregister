  \ then went to the Clyde, and was then renamed&nbsp;&#39;Malin&#39;. The owner holds\
  \ a copy of an original drawing scaled at 1/2in to 1ft, a revision dated 1975.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Original YSB8 engine replced in 2006 with Yanmar 15. No major changes to\
  \ original design, but deck has been relaid at some point, and the original cockpit\
  \ drains removed, now drains to the bilges. She is fitted with custom pulpit and\
  \ guard rails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014 she&nbsp;has had a 35sqft topsail jib added&nbsp;to\
  \ her sail wardrobe.</p>"
