short_description: <p><em>Snowdrop</em> is a Morecombe Bay Prawner</p>
full_description: <p>Reputed to have won the Isle of Man race in her early years,
  <em>Snowdrop</em> was purchased from Fleetwood in the 1960s and taken to the East
  Coast via &nbsp;the canal system to be restored at West Stockwith on the river Trent.
  &nbsp;Thereafter in the spring she would be sailed around down the Trent out into
  the Humber and around the coast to Bridlington where she stayed until &nbsp;the
  Autumn before making the return trip. She was sold out of OGA ownership in the early
  &nbsp;70. Information about her subsequent history would be appreciated.</p>
