  *Snowdrop* is a Morecombe Bay Prawner
full_description: |-
  Reputed to have won the Isle of Man race in her early years,
  *Snowdrop* was purchased from Fleetwood in the 1960s and taken to the East
  Coast via the canal system to be restored at West Stockwith on the river Trent.
  Thereafter in the spring she would be sailed around down the Trent out into
  the Humber and around the coast to Bridlington where she stayed until the
  Autumn before making the return trip. She was sold out of OGA ownership in the early
  1970's. Information about her subsequent history would be appreciated.
