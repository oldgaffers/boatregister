short_description: ''
full_description: "'Nyala' was commissioned by F.P.Culbert for use in a film, and\
  \ designed by Maurice Griffiths as one of the first shallow draft pleasure vessels.\
  \ She was built by Eversons of Woodbridge out of Oregon pine on oak frames, with\
  \ a double copped skin on all her immersed hull. Unfortunately her original hull\
  \ drawings were lost in the floods of 1953, but her original design spec and sail\
  \ plan survive. \r\n\r\nShe underwent a complete restoration in 1979 by the New\
  \ Zealand carpenter Grant Adams, and was later popularised by the journalist and\
  \ novelist Sylvia Murphy, who with her illustrator husband cruised 'Nyala' widely,\
  \ and wrote a book dedicated to her restoration \"Keeping Nyala in Style\". A second\
  \ restoration in 2011 kept her going strong.\r\n\r\nAfter 20 years in the Mediterranean\
  \ 'Nyala' found a new owner and headed north in 2017.\r\n\r\nShe is now kept in\
  \ Paimpol, Brittany, and had been classified as a Patrimonial INterest Boat (BIP)\
  \ by the French official Association \"Patrimoine Maritime et Fluvial\".\r\n\r\n\
  \r\nMost of the information can be read in the Classic Boat articles"
