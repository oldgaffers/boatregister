  *Peggy* is an ex working prawning boat, believed to
  have been built about 1910 by Crossfields at Arnside. She worked
  out of Maryport under registration number MT13.
full_description: |-
  Phil and Rose-Marie Newman purchased *Peggy* in
  1999 and found her to be a fast and capable boat; achieving good passage times
  as well as being stable and comfortable in a seaway.

  During their early years of ownership they enjoyed some success in East Coast OGA races,
  more recently enjoying cruising both sides of the English Channel with family. In 2013,
  *Peggy* took part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge; incidentally,
  from Falmouth north around and back to Ipswich, her home port, just husband
  and wife aboard, learning how very manageable and enjoyable this was.

  On retirement the Newman's moved abroad, and put *Peggy* up for
  sale. As is often the case with older boats she took a while to sell and when
  she was eventually bought it was to remove her engine and ballast for salvage.
  Fortunately her plight came to the attention of Eric Crossfield, the builder's
  grandson. He bought her and she was towed round to the Woodbridge Boat Yard where
  she awaits restoration.

    At 36u2019 on deck, 11u2019 beam and about 5u2019 max. draft,
    *Peggy* is one of the larger prawners, sleeping five in two cabins plus WC/washroom.
    Believed to be built around 1910 by Crossfields, Arnside, she worked out of
    Mayport with fishing no. MT13.</p><p>Her fit has been maintained by current
    owners for extended cruising. All her sails, standing rigging, and running rigging
    have been renewed. Apart from her cruising rig other sails include lightweight
    racing jib and staysail, topsail and various reaching foresails. All the sails
    and rigging are in good or excellent condition. Her spars and hull are in very
    good condition, her bowsprit was replaced with one in laminated spruce in about
    2005. Her engine is really excellent: a Nanni 4-43HD; 4 cylinder 2.2 litre engine
    with water cooled gearbox, and Brunton 18" self-adjusting three bladed propeller;
    all new and installed in 2013, and has had little use. 120 litres capacity of
    diesel. 60 litres of fresh water. Jabsco toilet about 5years old. Nelson cooker,
    gimbled with two burners plus grill and oven, VHF radio and Garmin plotter were
    new for the 2013 trip. She has a Reflexs diesel cabin heater. Lewmar winches,
    fenders and two bilge pumps.

    For the 2013 Round Britain Challenge, we fitted a cockpit cuddy and stern railing but
    this is easily removed if so desired. *Peggy* is a powerful and fast passage maker,
    yet can be sailed quite easily by two people. We are open to fair offers
