full_description: "<p>Phil and Rose-Marie Newman purchased &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo; in\
  \ 1999 and found her to be a fast and capable boat; achieving good passage times\
  \ as well as being stable and comfortable in a seaway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their\
  \ early years of ownership they enjoyed some success in East Coast OGA races, more\
  \ recently enjoying cruising both sides of the English Channel with family. In 2013,\
  \ &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo; took part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge; incidentally,\
  \ from Falmouth north around and back to Ipswich, her home port,&nbsp; just husband\
  \ and wife aboard, learning how very manageable and enjoyable this was.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>On retirement the Newman&#39;s moved abroad, and put &quot;Peggy&quot; up for\
  \ sale. As is often the case with older boats she took a while to sell and when\
  \ she was eventually bought it was to remove her engine and ballast for salvage.\
  \ Fortunately her plight came to the attention of Eric&nbsp;Crossfield, the builder&#39;s\
  \ grandson. He bought her and she was towed round to the Woodbridge Boat Yard where\
  \ she awaits restoration.</p>"
