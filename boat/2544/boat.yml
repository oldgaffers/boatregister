short_description: <p>&#39;Peggy&#39; is an ex working prawning boat, believed to
  have been built about 1910 by Crossfields at Arnside,&nbsp; Morcambe Bay. She worked
  out of Maryport under registration number MT13.</p>
full_description: "<p>Phil and Rose-Marie Newman purchased &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo; in\
  \ 1999 and found her to be a fast and capable boat; achieving good passage times\
  \ as well as being stable and comfortable in a seaway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their\
  \ early years of ownership they enjoyed some success in East Coast OGA races, more\
  \ recently enjoying cruising both sides of the English Channel with family. In 2013,\
  \ &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo; took part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge; incidentally,\
  \ from Falmouth north around and back to Ipswich, her home port,&nbsp; just husband\
  \ and wife aboard, learning how very manageable and enjoyable this was.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>On retirement the Newman&#39;s moved abroad, and put &quot;Peggy&quot; up for\
  \ sale. As is often the case with older boats she took a while to sell and when\
  \ she was eventually bought it was to remove her engine and ballast for salvage.\
  \ Fortunately her plight came to the attention of Eric&nbsp;Crossfield, the builder&#39;s\
  \ grandson. He bought her and she was towed round to the Woodbridge Boat Yard where\
  \ she awaits restoration.</p>"

    \ \"Peggy\" is one of the larger prawners, sleeping five in two cabins plus WC/washroom.\
    \ Believed to be built around 1910 by Crossfields, Arnside, she worked out of\
    \ Mayport with fishing no. MT13.</p><p>Her fit has been maintained by current\
    \ owners for extended cruising. All her sails, standing rigging, and running rigging\
    \ have been renewed. Apart from her cruising rig other sails include lightweight\
    \ racing jib and staysail, topsail and various reaching foresails. All the sails\
    \ and rigging are in good or excellent condition. Her spars and hull are in very\
    \ good condition, her bowsprit was replaced with one in laminated spruce in about\
    \ 2005. Her engine is really excellent: a Nanni 4-43HD; 4 cylinder 2.2 litre engine\
    \ with water cooled gearbox, and Brunton 18\" self-adjusting three bladed propeller;\
    \ all new and installed in 2013, and has had little use. 120 litres capacity of\
    \ diesel. 60 litres of fresh water. Jabsco toilet about 5years old. Nelson cooker,\
    \ gimbled with two burners plus grill and oven, VHF radio and Garmin plotter were\
    \ new for the 2013 trip. She has a Reflexs diesel cabin heater. Lewmar winches,\
    \ fenders and two bilge pumps.</p><p>For the 2013 Round Britain Challenge, we\
    \ fitted a cockpit cuddy and stern railing but this is easily removed if so desired.\
    \ Peggy is a powerful and fast passage maker, yet&nbsp;&nbsp;can be sailed quite\
    \ easily by two people. We are open to fair offers</p>"
