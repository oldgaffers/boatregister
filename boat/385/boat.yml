full_description: |-
  *Gladimaris* was originally *Mizpah*, a yawl-rigged Plymouth fishing boat
  (PH255) built in Stonehouse in 1885. In 1919 she was re-registered as *Venture*
  and cutter rigged to be used as a pilot boat out of Exmouth. She was replaced by
  a motor launch in 1934 and sold on to be converted into a cruising yacht. In
  1938 she registered with Lloyds register of Yachts by the McNabb family (and
  renamed after the owner’s spouse: Gladys Mary).


  After restoration in England in 1966 that replaced her deck with western cedar,
  and gave her all new spars(spruce mast pine gaff, bowsprit and boom) she was
  shipped from Tilbury to Vancouver as deck cargo at the end of 1975. Here her
  restoration continued as the shearstrake was replaced with teak and new bulwarks
  were fitted. Interior finished with exotic woods.


  *Gladimaris* was still floating in 2024, but her new custodian is about to bring
  her ashore for a thorough restoration that will probably return her to her
  original dandy rig with standing lugsail aft.
