full_description: |-
  *Mizpah*was originally a yawl-rigged Plymouth fishing Hooker, then in 1919 she
  was converted to cutter rig and re-registered as *Venture*, PH255, to serve as
  the Exmouth pilot boat. When she was replaced by a motor launch in 1934
  *Venture* was sold on to be converted into a cruising yacht. In 1938 she
  registered with Lloyds register of Yachts by the McNabb family and renamed
  *Gladimaris* after the owner’s spouse, Gladys Mary.

  After a restoration in England in 1966 that replaced her deck with western
  cedar, and gave her all new spars(spruce mast pine gaff, bowsprit and boom) she
  was shipped from Tilbury to Vancouver as deck cargo at the end of 1975. Here her
  restoration continued as the shearstrake was replaced with teak and new bulwarks
  were fitted. The interior was finished with exotic woods. *Gladimaris* was still
  floating in 2024, but her new custodian has restored her original name, and  is bringing her ashore for a thorough
  restoration that will return her to her original dandy rig with standing lugsail
  aft.
