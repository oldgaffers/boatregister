short_description: <p>Cachalot is a gaff cutter built along similar lines to that
  of an East Coast smack. She was built as a private yacht by Robert Saunders of Folkstone
  between 1897 - 1900 and has a fascinating history. She is a Dunkirk Little Ship
  and was relaunched in 2017 following a major 10-year refit, ashore at the head of
  the River Deben, Suffolk.</p>
full_description: "<p>Cachalot&#39;s construction is carvel laid elm planking below\
  \ the waterline and pitch pine above. The planks are laid over oak frames and centreline\
  \ structure. She is of traditional form with a slightly raked stem, long keel, round\
  \ bilge and elliptical counter stern. Following a major restoration, starting in\
  \ 2007, much of the hull has been repaired or replaced, including the deck. She\
  \ was relaunched&nbsp;in summer 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For details about the launch,\

  <p>The OGA Newsletter Editor, 1977, muses on the yacht &lsquo;Cachalot&rsquo; as\
  \ a preface to publishing a letter about her from new owner, Ian Kiloh.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<blockquote>In the earlier 1960s a good looking 30&#39; cutter&rsquo;s hull sat\
  \ up at the top of Dixon Kerly&#39;s yard at Maldon, quietly drying out and deteriorating.\
  \ Occasionally there was evidence that some work had been done on her, and in 1965\
  \ her then owner, David Garber was persuaded to join the OGA, and we looked forward\
  \ to seeing her sailing. But it was not to be. In 1969 she was bought by David Robertson\
  \ Hiner of Maldon, and things happened. David got her into sailing trim, and in\
  \ 1970 he entered her for our East Coast Race, but she did not start. On the 16th\
  \ September that year, David sold her to Thomas Alexander Corbett, who owned her\
  \ until the 9th February 1975, when she was sold to Andrew Ross Wheatley. On November\
  \ 25th 1975, Ian Ferderick Kiloh bought her from Wheatley.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\
  <blockquote>Yes, my &lsquo;Cachalot&rsquo;, is indeed the same as owned by David\
  \ and yes, we&rsquo;ve had a major task involving new carlins, doubling up the main\
  \ beam (which was broken), new covering boards, several new half beams, new bulwarks,\
  \ hatches, cabin trunking, interior, the list goes on, and on . . .</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>However, the end is at least in sight and although we do not expect\
  \ her to be really A1 until next year we anticipate having our first sail in her\
  \ in May this year, all going to plan. She is a really lovely little yacht and has\
  \ been well worth all the effort. My wife and I purchased her in November 1975 in\
  \ Wivenhoe after her having been sunk - and run over by a coaster!</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>One interesting thing we have found is the original advertisement\
  \ as placed in the Yachtsman of October 1897 by her builder offering her up for\
  \ sale. Interestingly she was &lsquo;almost &lsquo;completed&rsquo; then, yet registered\
  \ in 1904 as being built in 1900. She appears in Lloyd&#39;s Register in 1902.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Her first sails were by English, and purchased in 1902. We think\
  \ that probably the Boer War accounts for the anomolies. The builder/designer did\
  \ in fact own a timber yard - I think his claim of &lsquo;built of best materials&rsquo;\
  \ is the reason she is still around today as her last ten years or so seem to have\
  \ treated her very unkindly. I would be most grateful for any information as to\
  \ her earlier history; and I would be delighted if any OGA members have information\
  \ on the efficiency of either Cascover sheathing or Admiralty &lsquo;Impetite&rsquo;.</blockquote>\r\
