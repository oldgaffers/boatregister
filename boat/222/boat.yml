  Cachalot is a gaff cutter built along similar lines to that of an East Coast
  smack yacht. She was built by timber merchant Robert Sanders of Folkstone, Kent
  in 1898. Cachalot has an interesting history, with some illustrious previous
  owners. She is a Dunkirk Little Ship and has sailed as far as the Mediterranean.
  She was relaunched in 2017 following a major 10-year refit, ashore at the head
  of the River Deben, Suffolk.

full_description: "Cachalot's construction was carvel laid elm planking below the\
  \ waterline and\npitch pine above on oak. Since the restoration, she is now larch\
  \ on oak. She is\nof traditional form with a slightly raked stem, long keel, round\
  \ bilge and\nelliptical counter stern. Following a major restoration, starting in\
  \ 2007, most\nof the hull has been replaced, including the deck. She was relaunched\_\
  in summer\n2017.\n\nFor details about the launch, restoration and history of Cachalot,\
  \ who was a\nDunkirk Little Ship, [visit her website](http://www.cachalot.org.uk).\
  \ The\nwebsite also has a log of recent and historic sailing adventures, including\
  \ from\n1955.\n\nThe OGA Newsletter Editor, 1977, mused on the yacht \u2018Cachalot\u2019\
  \ as a preface to\npublishing a letter about her from new owner, Ian Kiloh.\n\n\n\
  > In the earlier 1960s a good looking 30' cutter\u2019s hull sat up at the top of\
  \ Dixon\n> Kerly's yard at Maldon, quietly drying out and deteriorating. Occasionally\
  \ there\n> was evidence that some work had been done on her, and in 1965 her then\
  \ owner,\n> David Garber was persuaded to join the OGA, and we looked forward to\
  \ seeing her\n> sailing. But it was not to be. In 1969 she was bought by David Robertson\
  \ Hiner\n> of Maldon, and things happened. David got her into sailing trim, and\
  \ in 1970 he\n> entered her for our East Coast Race, but she did not start. On the\
  \ 16th\n> September that year, David sold her to Thomas Alexander Corbett, who owned\
  \ her\n> until the 9th February 1975, when she was sold to Andrew Ross Wheatley.\
  \ On\n> November 25th 1975, Ian Ferderick Kiloh bought her from Wheatley.\n> \n\
  > \n\n\n> Yes, my \u2018Cachalot\u2019, is indeed the same as owned by David and\
  \ yes, we\u2019ve had a\n> major task involving new carlins, doubling up the main\
  \ beam (which was broken),\n> new covering boards, several new half beams, new bulwarks,\
  \ hatches, cabin\n> trunking, interior, the list goes on, and on . . .\n> \n> \n\
  \n\n> However, the end is at least in sight and although we do not expect her to\
  \ be\n> really A1 until next year we anticipate having our first sail in her in\
  \ May this\n> year, all going to plan. She is a really lovely little yacht and has\
  \ been well\n> worth all the effort. My wife and I purchased her in November 1975\
  \ in Wivenhoe\n> after her having been sunk - and run over by a coaster!\n> \n>\
  \ \n\n\n> One interesting thing we have found is the original advertisement as placed\
  \ in\n> the Yachtsman of October 1897 by her builder offering her up for sale.\n\
  > Interestingly she was \u2018almost \u2018completed\u2019 then, yet registered\
  \ in 1904 as being\n> built in 1900. She appears in Lloyd's Register in 1902.\n\
  > \n> \n\n\n> Her first sails were by English, and purchased in 1902. We think that\
  \ probably\n> the Boer War accounts for the anomolies. The builder/designer did\
  \ in fact own a\n> timber yard - I think his claim of \u2018built of best materials\u2019\
  \ is the reason she\n> is still around today as her last ten years or so seem to\
  \ have treated her very\n> unkindly. I would be most grateful for any information\
  \ as to her earlier\n> history; and I would be delighted if any OGA members have\
  \ information on the\n> efficiency of either Cascover sheathing or Admiralty \u2018\
  Impetite\u2019.\n> \n> \n\n#### First published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter\
