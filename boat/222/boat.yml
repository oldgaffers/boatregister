short_description: |-
  Cachalot is a gaff cutter built along similar lines to that of an East Coast
  smack. She was built as a private yacht by Robert Sanders of Folkstone between
  1888 and has a fascinating history. She is a Dunkirk Little Ship and was
  relaunched in 2017 following a major 10-year refit, ashore at the head of the
  River Deben, Suffolk. In 2023 she's celebrating her 125th birthday,  come and
  say hello!
full_description: "Cachalot's construction was originally carvel laid elm planking\
  \ below the\nwaterline and pitch pine above, laid over oak frames. She is of traditional\
  \ form\nwith a slightly raked stem, long keel, round bilge and elliptical counte\
  \ stern.\nHer current owner, Steve Yates, fell in love with her counterstern when\
  \ he found\nher on eBay, apparently for sale at The Suffolk Yacht Harbour, Levington\
  \ in\n2005. After a year sailing on the East Coast and getting to know the local\
  \ OGA\nmembers (Classic Boat #221), he planned a programme of winter maintenance\
  \ but\nshe almost sank at her berth in January 2006. Following careful inspection\
  \ rot\nwas discovered in the archboard and beam shelf. She had also suffered from\n\
  over-enthusiastic re- fastening of the planks. Closer examination revealed the\n\
  extent of the problems and she was declared a major project in May 2007. \n\n\n\
  Ten years later, she emerged from her tent to be re-launched, 4 August, 2017 on\n\
  the banks of the River Deben at the Tidemill Yacht Harbour, Woodbridge.\n\n\nThe\
  \ restoration included a new ply deck, 90% new planking in larch, new\nsternpost,\
  \ stem, rudder, bulwarks and replacement or sistering of most of her\nframes. Her\
  \ bowsprit, featured in Tom Cunliffe’s book ‘Hand, Reef and Steer’\n(first edition)\
  \ was replaced and a new set of gaff jaws were crafted from the\nshattered remnants\
  \ of the original and fitted to her gaff spar. The renowned\nsail loft, Ratsey &\
  \ Lapthorn, Isle of Wight was chosen to make her new suit of\nsails and her Yanmar\
  \ auxiliary engine was fully reconditioned. New boards for\nthe sole and cockpit\
  \ were crafted using some of the reclaimed teak deck. The\ninterior fit out was\
  \ completed afloat between 2018 - 2022.\n\n\nAs members of the OGA, there was plenty\
  \ of local support during the restoration\nproject from the friendly, helpful membership\
  \ on the East Coast, Netherlands and\nother parts of the UK and Ireland. During\
  \ the summer months visiting yachtsmen,\nberth holders and OGA members called by\
  \ to provide encouragement and to marvel\nat how much progress had been made ‘since\
  \ the last time we visited xx years\nago!’\n\n\nFor details about the launch, restoration\
  \ and history of Cachalot, who was a\nDunkirk Little Ship, [visit her website](https://www.cachalot.org.uk).\n\
  \n\nThe OGA Newsletter Editor, 1977, muses on the yacht ‘Cachalot’ as a preface\
  \ to\npublishing a letter about her from new owner, Ian Kiloh.\n\n\n\n> \n> In the\
  \ earlier 1960s a good looking 30' cutter’s hull sat up at the top of Dixon\n> Kerly's\
  \ yard at Maldon, quietly drying out and deteriorating. Occasionally there\n> was\
  \ evidence that some work had been done on her, and in 1965 her then owner,\n> David\
  \ Garber was persuaded to join the OGA, and we looked forward to seeing her\n> sailing.\
  \ But it was not to be. In 1969 she was bought by David Robertson Hiner\n> of Maldon,\
  \ and things happened. David got her into sailing trim, and in 1970 he\n> entered\
  \ her for our East Coast Race, but she did not start. On the 16th\n> September that\
  \ year, David sold her to Thomas Alexander Corbett, who owned her\n> until the 9th\
  \ February 1975, when she was sold to Andrew Ross Wheatley. On\n> November 25th\
  \ 1975, Ian Ferderick Kiloh bought her from Wheatley.\n> \n> \n> Yes, my ‘Cachalot’,\
  \ is indeed the same as owned by David and yes, we’ve had a\n> major task involving\
  \ new carlins, doubling up the main beam (which was broken),\n> new covering boards,\
  \ several new half beams, new bulwarks, hatches, cabin\n> trunking, interior, the\
  \ list goes on, and on . . .\n> \n> \n> However, the end is at least in sight and\
  \ although we do not expect her to be\n> really A1 until next year we anticipate\
  \ having our first sail in her in May this\n> year, all going to plan. She is a\
  \ really lovely little yacht and has been well\n> worth all the effort. My wife\
  \ and I purchased her in November 1975 in Wivenhoe\n> after her having been sunk\
  \ - and run over by a coaster!\n> \n> \n> One interesting thing we have found is\
  \ the original advertisement as placed in\n> the Yachtsman of October 1897 by her\
  \ builder offering her up for sale.\n> Interestingly she was ‘almost ‘completed’\
  \ then, yet registered in 1904 as being\n> built in 1900. She appears in Lloyd's\
  \ Register in 1902.\n> \n> \n> Her first sails were by English, and purchased in\
  \ 1902. We think that probably\n> the Boer War accounts for the anomolies. The builder/designer\
  \ did in fact own a\n> timber yard - I think his claim of ‘built of best materials’\
  \ is the reason she\n> is still around today as her last ten years or so seem to\
  \ have treated her very\n> unkindly. I would be most grateful for any information\
  \ as to her earlier\n> history; and I would be delighted if any OGA members have\
  \ information on the\n> efficiency of either Cascover sheathing or Admiralty ‘Impetite’.\n\
