short_description: |-
  Cachalot is a gaff cutter built along similar lines to that of an East Coast
  smack. She was built as a private yacht by Robert Sanders of Folkstone between
  1888 and has a fascinating history. She is a Dunkirk Little Ship and was
  relaunched in 2017 following a major 10-year refit, ashore at the head of the
  River Deben, Suffolk. In 2023 she's celebrating her 125th birthday,  come and
  say hello!
full_description: "Cachalot's construction was originally carvel laid elm planking\
  \ below the\nwaterline and pitch pine above, laid over oak frames. She is of traditional\
  \ form\nwith a slightly raked stem, long keel, round bilge and elliptical counte\
  \ stern.\nHer current owner, Steve Yates, fell in love with her counterstern when\
  \ he found\nher on eBay, apparently for sale at The Suffolk Yacht Harbour, Levington\
  \ in\n2005. After a year sailing on the East Coast and getting to know the local\
  \ OGA\nmembers (Classic Boat #221), he planned a programme of winter maintenance\
  \ but\nshe almost sank at her berth in January 2006. Following careful inspection\
  \ rot\nwas discovered in the archboard and beam shelf. She had also suffered from\n\
  over-enthusiastic re- fastening of the planks. Closer examination revealed the\n\
  extent of the problems and she was declared a major project in May 2007. \n\nTen\
  \ years later, she emerged from her tent to be re-launched, 4 August, 2017 on\n\
  the banks of the River Deben at the Tidemill Yacht Harbour, Woodbridge.\n\nThe restoration\
  \ included a new ply deck, 90% new planking in larch, new\nsternpost, stem, rudder,\
  \ bulwarks and replacement or sistering of most of her\nframes. Her bowsprit, featured\
  \ in Tom Cunliffe’s book ‘Hand, Reef and Steer’\n(first edition) was replaced and\
  \ a new set of gaff jaws were crafted from the\nshattered remnants of the original\
  \ and fitted to her gaff spar. The renowned\nsail loft, Ratsey & Lapthorn, Isle\
  \ of Wight was chosen to make her new suit of\nsails and her Yanmar auxiliary engine\
  \ was fully reconditioned. New boards for\nthe sole and cockpit were crafted using\
  \ some of the reclaimed teak deck. The\ninterior fit out was completed afloat between\
  \ 2018 - 2022.\n\nAs members of the OGA, there was plenty of local support during\
  \ the restoration\nproject from the friendly, helpful membership on the East Coast,\
  \ Netherlands and\nother parts of the UK and Ireland. During the summer months visiting\
  \ yachtsmen,\nberth holders and OGA members called by to provide encouragement and\
  \ to marvel\nat how much progress had been made ‘since the last time we visited\
  \ xx years\nago!’\n\nFor details about the launch, restoration and history of Cachalot,\
  \ who was a\nDunkirk Little Ship, [visit her website](https://www.cachalot.org.uk).\n\
  \nThe OGA Newsletter Editor, 1977, muses on the yacht ‘Cachalot’ as a preface to\n\
  publishing a letter about her from new owner, Ian Kiloh.\n\n\n> In the earlier 1960s\
  \ a good looking 30' cutter’s hull sat up at the top of Dixon\n> Kerly's yard at\
  \ Maldon, quietly drying out and deteriorating. Occasionally there\n> was evidence\
  \ that some work had been done on her, and in 1965 her then owner,\n> David Garber\
  \ was persuaded to join the OGA, and we looked forward to seeing her\n> sailing.\
  \ But it was not to be. In 1969 she was bought by David Robertson Hiner\n> of Maldon,\
  \ and things happened. David got her into sailing trim, and in 1970 he\n> entered\
  \ her for our East Coast Race, but she did not start. On the 16th\n> September that\
  \ year, David sold her to Thomas Alexander Corbett, who owned her\n> until the 9th\
  \ February 1975, when she was sold to Andrew Ross Wheatley. On\n> November 25th\
  \ 1975, Ian Ferderick Kiloh bought her from Wheatley.\n> \n> Yes, my ‘Cachalot’,\
  \ is indeed the same as owned by David and yes, we’ve had a\n> major task involving\
  \ new carlins, doubling up the main beam (which was broken),\n> new covering boards,\
  \ several new half beams, new bulwarks, hatches, cabin\n> trunking, interior, the\
  \ list goes on, and on . . .\n> \n> However, the end is at least in sight and although\
  \ we do not expect her to be\n> really A1 until next year we anticipate having our\
  \ first sail in her in May this\n> year, all going to plan. She is a really lovely\
  \ little yacht and has been well\n> worth all the effort. My wife and I purchased\
  \ her in November 1975 in Wivenhoe\n> after her having been sunk - and run over\
  \ by a coaster!\n> \n> One interesting thing we have found is the original advertisement\
  \ as placed in\n> the Yachtsman of October 1897 by her builder offering her up for\
  \ sale.\n> Interestingly she was ‘almost ‘completed’ then, yet registered in 1904\
  \ as being\n> built in 1900. She appears in Lloyd's Register in 1902.\n> \n> Her\
  \ first sails were by English, and purchased in 1902. We think that probably\n>\
  \ the Boer War accounts for the anomolies. The builder/designer did in fact own\
  \ a\n> timber yard - I think his claim of ‘built of best materials’ is the reason\
  \ she\n> is still around today as her last ten years or so seem to have treated\
  \ her very\n> unkindly. I would be most grateful for any information as to her earlier\n\
  > history; and I would be delighted if any OGA members have information on the\n\
  > efficiency of either Cascover sheathing or Admiralty ‘Impetite’.\n> \n> \n\n####\
