    She comes with furling jib, furling staysail, main and topsail and is powered
    by a Tohatsu 9.8 hp 2 stroke and also a Silver Century British Seagull 5 hp. She
    has a new rain cover and also a boom tent. She is a safe, very kindly boat and
    a joy to sail. With a high freeboard she sits head to wind to allow all reefing

full_description: "<p>Mayblossom was built and owned by Mr B Patten in Althorne Essex\
  \ in 1973. Mr GA Marshall owned her for 3 \xBD years before bringing her down to\
  \ the Dart in Devon from Jul 1983 (?). Since then she has been used to cruise the\
  \ coasts and rivers of Devon and Cornwall. She has taken part in the Brixham Heritage\
  \ Regatta, OGA South West events and Plymouth &amp; Fowey Classics.</p>\n<p>She\
  \ is a pretty, well-designed boat. Her lifting keel means that she has also explored\
  \ the upper reaches of the Exe, Dart, Tamar, Fowey and Helford</p>\n<p>She was brought\
  \ down to Helford from Brixham in 2018 and proved to be a very kindly boat - easily\
  \ sailed single handed. She entered the Falmouth classics in June 2018 and 2019.\
  \ In May 2019 her keel fell off (3/4\" bolt rusted through) and keel had to be manufactured\
  \ from drawings. This was completed in time to the Falmouth classics and she is\
  \ back in the water. She also attended the SW Gaffers parade of sail at Plymouth\
  \ in Jul 2019 overnighting at Cawsand and Polperro.</p>"
