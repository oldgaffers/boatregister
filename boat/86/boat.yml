full_description: "<p>Mayblossom was built and owned by Mr B Patten in Althorne Essex
  in 1973. Mr GA Marshall owned her for 3 ½ years before bringing her down to the
  Dart in Devon from Jul 1983 (?). Since then she has been used to cruise the coasts
  and rivers of Devon and Cornwall. She has taken part in the Brixham Heritage Regatta,
  OGA South West events and Plymouth &amp; Fowey Classics.</p>\n<p>She is a pretty,
  well-designed boat. Her lifting keel means that she has also explored the upper
  reaches of the Exe, Dart, Tamar, Fowey and Helford</p>\n<p>She was brought down
  to Helford from Brixham in 2018 and proved to be a very kindly boat - easily sailed
  single handed. She entered the Falmouth classics in June 2018 and 2019. In May 2019
  her keel fell off (3/4\" bolt rusted through) and keel had to be manufactured from
  drawings. This was completed in time to the Falmouth classics and she is back in
  the water. She also attended the SW Gaffers parade of sail at Plymouth in Jul 2019
  overnighting at Cawsand and Polperro.</p>"
