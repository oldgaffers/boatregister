  \ Dart in Devon from Jul 1983 (?). Since then she has been used to cruise the coasts\
  \ and rivers of Devon and Cornwall. She has taken part in the Brixham Heritage Regatta,\
  \ OGA South West events and Plymouth &amp; Fowey Classics.</p>\n<p>She is a pretty,\

  \ to Helford from Brixham in 2018 and proved to be a very kindly boat - easily sailed\
  \ single handed. She entered the Falmouth classics in June 2018 and 2019. In May\
  \ 2019 her keel fell off (3/4\" bolt rusted through) and keel had to be manufactured\
  \ from drawings. This was completed in time to the Falmouth classics and she is\
  \ back in the water. She also attended the SW Gaffers parade of sail at Plymouth\
  \ in Jul 2019 overnighting at Cawsand and Polperro.</p>"
