  *Stout* was built in 1907 for the Royal Pilot Administration
  (Kungliga Lotsstyrelsen) for service in &Ouml;resound under sail or power propulsion.
full_description: |+
  The requirements of the time were that vessels should be able
  to accomplish their work as a pilot under sail or engine power. A raw oil engine
  was therefore installed. After her service as a pilot boat she was sold to a person
  in Limhamn (outside Malm&ouml;) and was painted white.
  
  She was rigged with only one mast, and is said to have had terrible sailing properties.
  After some time she was sold to Limhamns Sj&ouml;scoutk&aring;r (sea scouts), still
  with one mast but was painted black again.
  
  Later she ended up with
  a captain from Norway, who understood that she needed her original ketch rig.
  He was also responsible for the glass fibre sheathing (this was done around 1974-75).
  Her home port was Stockholm during this time.
  
  In 1990 she was bought by a sailmaker in Idrefjorden. He only kept her a short time
  and she was then bought by KFUK-KFUM:s Sj&ouml;scoutk&aring;r i Malm&ouml; (sea scouts) again.
  They made some repairs and changes to the interior and sailed her for several
  years.
  
  From 1999 she was laid up on land, unfortunately without
  a cover. Wind and rain did some damage to the superstructure and the cockpit started
  to rot. She was a sad sight. The bowsprit had been broken and lay in pieces in
  a shed nearby.
  
  She was gradually rebuilt between 2001-7 by Magnus Krampell, before he sold her.

  In her 2006 advertisement, she was described as 'a little ship with plenty of character'.
