short_description: <p>&#39;Stout&#39; was built 1907 for the Royal Pilot Administration
  (Kungliga Lotsstyrelsen) for service in &Ouml;resound under sail or power propulsion.
  In a &#39;For sale&#39; ad. in 2006, she was described as &#39;a little ship with
  plenty of character&#39;.</p>
full_description: "<p>The requirements of the time were that vessels should be able\
  \ to accomplish their work as a pilot under sail or engine power. A raw oil engine\
  \ was therefore installed. After her service as a pilot boat she was sold to a person\
  \ in Limhamn (outside Malm&ouml;) and was painted white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was rigged\
  \ with only one mast, and is said to have had terrible sailing properties. After\
  \ some time she was sold to Limhamns Sj&ouml;scoutk&aring;r (sea scouts), still\
  \ with one mast but was painted black again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later she ended up with\
  \ a captain from Norway, who understood that she needed her original ketch rig.\
  \ He was also responsible for the glass fibre sheathing (this was done around 1974-75).\
  \ Her home port was Stockholm during this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1990 she was bought\
  \ by a sailmaker in Idrefjorden. He only kept her a short time and she was then\
  \ bought by KFUK-KFUM:s Sj&ouml;scoutk&aring;r i Malm&ouml; (sea scouts) again.\
  \ They made some repairs and changes to the interior and sailed her for several\
  \ years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1999 she was laid up on land, unfortunately without\
  \ a cover. Wind and rain did some damage to the superstructure and the cockpit started\
  \ to rot. She was a sad sight. The bowsprit had been broken and lay in pieces in\
  \ a shed nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was gradually rebuilt between 2001-7 by Magnus\
  \ Krampell, before he sold her.</p>"
