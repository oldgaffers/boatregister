  \nShe's hove to again, held her head to wind\n\nDrifting to nowhere borne by the\
  \ tide  \nRoll on the day when she sails clean away  \nHer white winding wake to\
  \ her stern  \n\nChorus\n\nShe's a ship without water, a king's ransom daughter\
  \  \nSailing alone on the tide  \nShe slowly advanced, squared up then danced  \n\
  The belle ballerina of the bay  \nSailed wild for a while with ladies in style \
  \ \nTrips to the islands, had a hell of a time  \nSailings not easy two skippers\
  \ on board  \nStorm warnings hoisted, trouble in store  \n\nChorus\n\nSailing the\
  \ west coast in the teeth of a gale  \nBeating to windward close rigged and storm\
  \ sail  \nSank to the depths of an angry green sea  \nA graveyard for the lady,\
  \ jealousy and me  \n\nChorus\n\nShe's hove to again, held her head to wind  \n\
  Drifting to nowhere borne by the tide  \nRoll on the day when she sails clean away\
  \  \nHer white winding wake to her stern  \n\nChorus  \nShe's a ship without water,\
  \ a king's ransom daughter  \nSailing alone on the tide  \nShe slowly advanced,\
  \ squared up then danced  \nThe belle ballerina of the bay  \nShe's the belle ballerina\
  \ of the bay\n"
