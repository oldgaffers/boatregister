  Brothers on Church Hill in 1903. She was built as a yacht. However, she is not

  # BALLERINA by Dave Walters

  She's hove to again, held her head to wind
  
  Drifting to nowhere borne by the tide  
  Roll on the day when she sails clean away  
  Her white winding wake to her stern  
  
  Chorus
  
  She's a ship without water, a king's ransom daughter  
  Sailing alone on the tide  
  She slowly advanced, squared up then danced  
  The belle ballerina of the bay  
  Sailed wild for a while with ladies in style  
  Trips to the islands, had a hell of a time  
  Sailings not easy two skippers on board  
  Storm warnings hoisted, trouble in store  

  Chorus

  Sailing the west coast in the teeth of a gale  
  Beating to windward close rigged and storm sail  
  Sank to the depths of an angry green sea  
  A graveyard for the lady, jealousy and me  
  
  Chorus

  She's hove to again, held her head to wind  
  Drifting to nowhere borne by the tide  
  Roll on the day when she sails clean away  
  Her white winding wake to her stern  
  
  Chorus  
  She's a ship without water, a king's ransom daughter  
  Sailing alone on the tide  
  She slowly advanced, squared up then danced  
  The belle ballerina of the bay  
  She's the belle ballerina of the bay
