  *Martlet* is a beautiful varnished clinker dinghy from the 1940s.

  *Martlet's* history is hazy but we believe (from research kindly
  undertaken by Nic Compton) that she was a prototype for a possible new design
  class for Emsworth Yacht Club in 1948. The design was not taken forward therefore
  she remains a one-off.
  
  *Martlet* was purchased by the current owner's father
  in the 1970s and she was a much-loved family dinghy for many years. Although
  based in Berkshire, the family took their annual family holiday in Helford in
  Cornwall and the current owner has many happy memories or learning to sail in
  *Martlet* on the Helford river as a child. The current owner now lives in Helford
  and *Martlet* is permanently based there.
  
  *Martlet* was substantially rebuilt and beautifully refurbished by Ashley Butler 
  of Butler & Co in Penpol, Cornwall between 2017 and 2020 and she now looks as
  lovely as she would have done when she was first built (if not better!)
