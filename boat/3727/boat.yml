  Martlet is a beautiful varnished clinker dinghy from the 1940s.

full_description: "Martlet's history is hazy but we believe (from research kindly\
  \ undertaken by Nic\nCompton) that she was a prototype for a possible new design\
  \ class for Emsworth\nYacht Club in 1948. The design was not taken forward therefore\
  \ she remains a\none-off.\n\nMartlet was purchased by the current owner's father\
  \ in the 1970s and she was a\nmuch-loved family dinghy for many years. Although\
  \ based in Berkshire, the family\ntook their annual family holiday in Helford in\
  \ Cornwall and the current owner\nhas many happy memories or learning to sail in\
  \ Martlet on the Helford river as a\nchild.  \_The current owner now lives in Helford\
  \ and Martlet is permanently based\nthere.\n\nMartlet was substantially rebuilt\
  \ and beautifully refurbished by Ashley Butler\nof Butler & Co in Penpol, Cornwall\
  \ between 2017 and 2020 and she now looks as\nlovely as she would have done when\
  \ she was first built (if not better!)\_\n\n"
