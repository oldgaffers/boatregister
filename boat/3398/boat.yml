  The original hull form was taken from an actual boat built at Devoran on the River Fal for an Oyster dredger. Developed by Cygnus Boats as a
  fishing/rowing/lug rigged boat she was adopted by the Hamble River Rowing club
  and christened The Bursledon Gig.

  They compete successfully in the close confines of the Hamble River with 20 odd
  boats plus a growing rowing fleet in Langstone  and elsewhere. 'De Ernest John
  C' has a Lug ketch rig using a Carbon pole and 'hand cut' sails. Lee way is
  interesting with no c/b or plate.
