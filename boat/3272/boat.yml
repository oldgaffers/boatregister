short_description: <p>&#39;Fiddle&#39; is a bawley built around 1860.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Fiddle&#39; was built and fished from Gravesend, shrimping\
  \ and stowboating until purchased by Ralf Chandler in 1952, who took her to Whistable\
  \ and dredged for oysters during the 1950s. He re-registered her on Part 1 Swansea\
  \ as F127.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chandler took her to Brixham in the late 1960s early 1970s.\
  \ She was owned by several people between the 1970s and 2000 and had various work\
  \ carried out which was left incomplete, leading to further deterioration.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She was purchased by Andy Cornish and his father and much work was carried\
  \ out by them under the guidance of David Patient. She was then sold to Robert Lee\
  \ and Hazel Brickhill in about 2008. They sailed her to Bristol where she was in\
  \ the floating harbour for several years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam Cloote bought &#39;Fiddle&#39;\
  \ in October 2014. In spring 2015 she was taken out of the water when rot was found\
  \ in the original elm planking and some later Douglas fir in the bows. All this\
  \ has been replaced by Mark Rolt. The restoration continues into 2015.</p>"
