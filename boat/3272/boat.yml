full_description: |-
  *Fiddle* is one of the last remaining Gravesend Bawleys.  Built in 1860, she
  fished for nearly 100 years before being converted to a comfortable cruising
  yacht in the 1960’s.


  It is believed that *Fiddle* was constructed at G Bauckhams yard on the site of
  the old Coal Wharf, Gravesend, probably by a legendary local shipwright , George
  Waters, some time in the late 1850’s or early 1860’s. Several clinker Bawleys of
  the same size were constructed in Gravesend at this time including *Lilian*,
  *Highland Mary* and *Charlotte*.  All of these, including *Fiddle* are well
  referenced in numerous text books, many of which are still in print.


  *Fiddle* was registered as LO 155 and fished under sail alone, trawling for
  shrimps predominantly, in the lower reaches of the Thames estuary from the
  1860’s right up to the start of WW2 when shrimping had to stop due to a
  protective barrage in the Thames.  It is believed that her first auxiliary
  engine was installed in the 1930’s.


  After the end of the war, she was sold and transferred to Whitstable to dredge
  for oysters and re-registered to Faversham with the number F124, which she still
  displays.  She was then taken down to Brixam, Devon in the late 1950’s/early
  60’s and has remained in the West Country ever since.


  Bawleys are generally loose footed cutter rigged with disproportionately tall
  top-masts to catch the higher breezes, often encountered in estuaries and river
  sailing.  With this rig, the mainsail can be brailed up to the mast allowing
  exceptional control in congested waters.  They are shallow drafted with a wide
  beam and pleasing lines.  *Fiddle* maintains this original form of rig with a
  long bowsprit, tall topmast and loose footed main.


  *Fiddle* is currently moored in The Floating Harbour at Bristol. She has been
  under the guardianship of the current owner for the last 10 years during which
  time she has undergone significant restoration work and routine maintenance
  under the guidance of Mark Rolt at Bristol Classic Boats.  Recent work (2022-23)
  has included significant replanking, repairs and renewal of deck beams, complete
  rebuild of fwd coachroof and complete re-decking. Repaint and
  overhaul/varnishing of spars.  Standing rigging replaced by Traditional Rigging
  (Bristol) in 2016.


  'Fiddle' was built and fished from Gravesend, shrimping and stowboating until
  purchased by Ralf Chandler in 1952, who took her to Whistable and dredged for
  oysters during the 1950s. He re-registered her on Part 1 Swansea as F127.


  Chandler took her to Brixham in the late 1960s early 1970s. She was owned by
  several people between the 1970s and 2000 and had various work carried out which
  was left incomplete, leading to further deterioration.


  She was purchased by Andy Cornish and his father and much work was carried out
  by them under the guidance of David Patient. She was then sold to Robert Lee and
  Hazel Brickhill in about 2008. They sailed her to Bristol where she was in the
  floating harbour for several years.


  Adam Cloote bought *Fiddle* in October 2014. In spring 2015 she was taken out of
  the water when rot was found in the original elm planking and some later Douglas
  fir in the bows. All this has been replaced by Mark Rolt. 


  Unfortunately the current owners are now unable to complete their plans to
  retire early and enjoy sailing *Fiddle* at their leisure.  Consequently, they
  are seeking to find sympathetic new owners who will appreciate this beautiful,
  historically important, yet unassuming vessel.  Fiddle will only be sold to the
  “right” purchaser
