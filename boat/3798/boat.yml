short_description: |-
  A new spirit of tradition, high-performance sailing dinghy.
full_description: |-
  Designed and built in my home workshop from 2024-25, as my ultimate do-it-all
  dinghy, and to break long-standing sailing records, demonstrating that
  traditional rigs and hull forms are still be relevant.    

  The intention is to attempt the non-stop round Britain in an open boat record in
  summer 2026.  

  Combining modern materials with decades of experience sailing and working on all
  kinds of traditional and modern, high-perfomance boats, Ræedwald is designed to
  be as versatile and user-friendly as possible. She has 2 mast steps and 5 rig
  configurations, including a single balanced lug rig, lug yawl rig(with tent for
  camping), cruising gaff rig, high-performance gaff rig (with trapeze), and
  "cat-boat style" single gaff mainsail.  

  She is constructed in plywood and carbon fibre, with an entirely carbon fibre
  rig. This makes her very light and strong, whilst maintening a traditional,
  clinker aesthetic.  

  The boat is self-draining, even in the unlikely event of being entirely swamped.
  She has generous freeboard and a huge amount of integrated buoyancy. This makes
  her a very safe coastal cruising boat.  
  She also has optional water ballast tanks beneath the cockpit sole, adding upto
  70kg of ballast, making her virtually uncapsizeable!  

  I have taken moulds of the hull and interior to produce further double-skinned,
  cored grp hulls, if there is interest.
