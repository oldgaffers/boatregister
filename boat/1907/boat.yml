full_description: "<h3>Description taken from &#39;For Sale&#39; notice, 2017</h3>\r\
  \n\r\n<h3>Hull</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>GRP hull, &#39;Estren&#39; was&nbsp;professionally\
  \ scraped back in 2017 when two coats of Gel shield were&nbsp;applied and she was\
  \ copper coated. Guaranteed maintainance free for 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Estren&#39;\
  \ has the larger coachroof which continues forward of the keel stepped mast. This\
  \ allows good headroom to sit in comfort on the heads in the forward cabin. Her\
  \ decks and coachroof were professionally resheathed in GRP, 2013. Various trims\
  \ were replaced and she recieved 10 coats of varnish all round. The cockpit is large\
  \ with seating for four. Although it is non-draining there is an electric bilge\
  \ pump (manual as well). For longer periods there is a cockpit cover. There are\
  \ two small lockers under the forward seats (port contains access to the fuel tank)\
  \ and there is a locker at the stern.&nbsp;There are two chrome sheet winches and\
  \ Teflon jamming cleats which work well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spars, sails and rigging</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>The gaff has throat and peak halyards so the main can be raised easily.\
  \ Permanent boom gallows on the transom fitted 2017 to ease this process. The bowsprit\
  \ is fully retractable. Most of the sails (white) are well used, professionally\
  \ serviced and valeted yearly. Main is slab reefed with 2 points. Blue mainsail\
  \ cover 2014. Jib and staysail are both on Wycombe Martin furlers. Heavy duty high\
  \ cut hank on gib which has never been used.&nbsp;Top sail is blue and white striped\
  \ &nbsp;(2014) flown from a windsurfer mast which is deployed very easily. When\
  \ not in use the sail remains bent onto the windsurfer mast and is lashed to the\
  \ boom. Light weather down wind sail flies from the bowsprit. This is in fact an\
  \ old spinnaker but it does the job well. Halyards and sheets were mainly all replaced\
  \ 2014 - 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vetus M20 professionally serviced\
  \ each year and it&#39;s never missed a beat. New control panel fitted 2016. I would\
  \ guess that the stainless tank holds around 25 gallons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cabin\
  \ and accommodation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Estren&#39; is very comfortable has good\
  \ headroom down below (5&#39;10) at best. The bunk cushions were reupholstered 2017.&nbsp;In\
  \ the saloon there is a newly constructed solid teak side facing chart table to\
  \ port, with good storage below, and a 6&#39;3&quot; berth with lee cloth. Shelving\
  \ above, storage below. Forward of this is a hanging locker. To port is&nbsp;the\
  \ galley with stainless sink with solid brass faucet. There is a 2016 flexible 50\
  \ litre water tank under the starboard berth and water is pumped to the sink via\
  \ a foot pump. There is a small solid brass bilge type pump along side the sink\
  \ which drains it. Next to the sink is an excellent 2 burner spirit (2017) stove\
  \ which will bring a kettle to boil in almost the same time as gas. Forward of the\
  \ galley is a berth which my friend of 6&#39; 1&quot; sleeps happily in. Shelving\
  \ above, storage below. There is&nbsp;traditional electric lighting and two oil\
  \ lamps. There is a solid teak folding table which stows in the forepeak and can\
  \ be used in the saloon or cockpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the forepeak there is a single\
  \ berth at 5&#39;10&#39; (but no taller). At the aft end the cushion can be removed\
  \ to reveal the Blakes sea toilet. Shelf to port where I store the beaching legs\
  \ and sail lockers below the berth.&nbsp;There is a door to this cabin.</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<h3>Other</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruce anchor which is perfect for this area and has&nbsp;held\
  \ her firm in a number of gales. 10 metes of chain and 30 meters of warp. There\
  \ is also a small kedge anchor which I&#39;ve yet to use. Nassa depth, and a new\
  \ (2016) Clipper wind wireless from the sender at the top of the mast so no cable.\
  \ It has its own small solar charger so no&nbsp;power or batteries required. There\
  \ is also a 2016 Raymarine ST1000 tiller pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brass oil nav. lights\
  \ for port and starboard which attach&nbsp;to wooden brackets on the shrouds. I\
  \ also have a set of battery nav. lights.</p>"

ownerships:
- note: Estren was ordered and built for a Devon based gentleman who retained all
    the letters between him and Martin Heard the builder. Estren was kept in the river
    Dart and sailed by this owner until 2006 when he lifted it and had it stored at
    his home. My mechanic/friend had serviced the engine from new and winter used
    it at that time. When the owner decided that he was too old to sail her again
    he advertised her for sale in 2013 when I purchased her. I completed a refit to
    bring her to her current condition. She has remained on the Dart in my ownership.
