short_description: '''Sirius'' 16'' gunter rigged, clinker cabin cruiser, built Faversham
  by Dick Dadson in 1968.'
full_description: "<p>&#39;Sirius&#39; was the 17th boat built by the Dadsons for\
  \ a Mr Jeffries on Rutland Water in south east England. He owned her for many years\
  \ until being sold to Mike Baumber in about 2000. She is built from mahogany on\
  \ steamed oak ribs, with ply deck and cabin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Sirius&#39; changed\
  \ hands in 2006&nbsp;and had new sails made by John Raven of Maldon. She was repainted\
  \ green. Her mast tabernacle was moved forwards by about 12&quot; to improve the\
  \ way she sails single handed on mainsail alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the plywood\
  \ deck and cabin top rotted, it was not replaced so she is now a fine dayboat.</p>"
