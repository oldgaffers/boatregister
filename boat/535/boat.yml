    Needs a new owner. Open to offers 

    Designed by Maurice Griffiths, the first and largest at 28’6” to be built in the
    range of transom sterned Cutters. She was a development of *Olive Mary,* which
    was built entirely to the owners requirements. *Seaway* is the boat Maurice
    Griffiths would have liked *Olive Mary* to have been. She was built in
    Portsmouth, 1930 by a well known builder and has been here abouts ever since.
    Sails well and stands upto a breeze. Good interior space with 4 births. A
    well looked after 27hp engine and a good set of sails. Ready for this season with a
