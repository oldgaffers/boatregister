    Designed by Maurice Griffiths, the first and largest at 28’6” to be built in the
    range of transom sterned Cutters. She was a development of Olive Mary, which was

    would have liked Olive Mary to have been. She was built in Portsmouth, 1930 by a
    well known builder and has been here abouts ever since. Sails well and stands
    upto a breeze. Good interior space with 4 births. A  looked after 27hp engine
    and a good set of sails. Ready for this season with a coat of paint.
