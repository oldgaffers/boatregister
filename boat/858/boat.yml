  note: Robert and Jan Holden have had care of Emanuel since February 1980.  The following
    8 years were spent in a thorough rebuild, at Sandwich Sailing and Motor Boat Club,
    returning Emanuel to the water in July 1988.  We are by far the longest owners
    (we consider ourselves custodians) of the 15 registered on the British Register
    of Ships - Official Number 111396 at Bridgwater.
