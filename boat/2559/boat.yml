full_description: "<p>Designed and built by Fabian Bush, 2002, &lsquo;Poppy&rsquo;\
  \ is a unique modern wooden classic. The details of her design, construction and\
  \ finish emulate the Victorian sailing canoes popular over 100 years ago.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>At the same time she gains the advantages of modern plywood construction\
  \ to give a wooden boat suitable for trailer sailing. She was built with especial\
  \ care for robustness and durability and she can be maintained with comparative\
  \ ease.</p>"
