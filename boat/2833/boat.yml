short_description: <p>&#39;Vera&#39; was built in 2004 by John Raymond-Barker (RB
  Boatbuilding, Underfall Yard, Bristol) and is pictured in the Classic Boat article
  of November 2006, where she is described as a Looe fishing boat.</p>
full_description: "<p>Her lines are in fact, according to John, taken from a Portloe\
  \ boat &#39;Rose of Portloe&#39; and he built her for his own use in 2004 using\
  \ mahogany planking on oak. She carries a single French lug sail and interestingly\
  \ has no centreboard, apparently the point being that these boats traditionally\
  \ kept their bottoms &#39;fair&#39; so as to be run up beaches, as with the Beer\
  \ beach boats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of having no plate, she sails well, although\
  \ you need to have her moving when you want to come about. As she is quite narrow\
  \ (approx 4&#39;3&#39;&#39; to her 12&#39;3&#39;&#39; LOA) John has introduced lead\
  \ ballast below the floors and bolted inside the keel with the lead cast to the\
  \ form of the clinker planking forming her bilges. There is about 50kg of lead cast\
  \ in three sections and all three may be needed for single-handed sailing to avoid\
  \ being too tender on the water. To compensate for the lead, she carries bouyancy\
  \ bags.</p>"
