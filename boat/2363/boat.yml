full_description: "Susan J's first owners took her through the French canals and cruised\
  \ the\nMediterranean. She had a complete refit during 2001 - 2002 at Sandbanks Yacht\n\
  Company, Poole, including a new bowsprit, rigging, teak work and electrics.\n\n\
  With her second owners, the Shaws, she sailed to the Channel Islands, Normandy\n\
  and Brittany coasts, west coast of England and the Scilly Islands from her base\n\
  in the Solent. In 2003 she sailed around Britain and in 2013 took part in the\n\
  OGA Jubilee celebrations in Cowes. She attended the 10th Anniversary Tour with\n\
  the Dutch OGA in 2014.\n\nChanging hands in 2017, as her new owners, we took her\
  \ on the OGA Sou' by\nSou'West Cruise when she reached the Scilly Islands. She attended\
  \ the\_OGA 55\ncelebrations in Cowes and in 2019 cruised to\_North Brittany.\n\n\
  Her 27 year old Perkins engine was replaced with a Beta 28 in 2018, by David\nLlewellin\
  \ of DL Marine, St Just in Roseland. \_We have upgraded her 12 V charging\nsystems\
  \ and overhauled the Taylor parafin stove. \_Her Simpson Lawrence manual\nwindlass,\
  \ Taylor gas cooker (and supply) were overhauled, during the lockdown.\n\_Her spars\
  \ were removed, overhauled and rigging simplified in 2020/21 by David\nCarne and\
  \ team at Riggers UK in Penryn\n\nSince Covid, as well as the south coast of Devon\
  \ and Cornwall and the Isles of\nScilly most years, she has cruised to Guernsey\
  \ in 2021 and Milford Haven in May\n2022.\n\nWe are hoping that \u201CSusan J\u201D\
  \ will join the \_OGA60 Round Britain Cruise from\nPlymouth in May 2023.\n\n"

    A Heard 28 Falmouth Workboat hull, built by Gaffers and Luggers in 1991, and
    fitted out by Traditional Yacht Services in 1992 on the Isle of Wight. One
    previous owner, sleeps five. Sale includes extensive list of Raymarine
    instruments chartplotter/radar. VHF Navtex and more. Well equipped for cruising.

    GRP hull, ply covered deck, teak superstructure with painted Brazilian mahoganhy
    coachouse sides. Perkins Parama 30hp three cylinder diesel engine, fresh water
    cooled. LOD 28", LWL 26.6", Draft 5.3", LOA 41", Beam 9.9"

    We have had "Susan J" since October 1999. We have found her to be a very fast
    and stable cruising boat. Whether sailing with two or four people she has proved
    to be comfortable for a boat only 28" in length. Cruising ground includes
    sailing round Britain, frequent cruises to France and Holland. "Susan J" is a
    one off, built to a high standard on the Heard 28 hull. She is in very good
    order having had a major refit in 2002 and well maintained by professionals on
    an annual basis ever since. The boat has been wintered ashore every year. The
    professionally finished interior certainly makes this boat top of the list if
    you are looking for a modern boat with traditional styling and rig.

    Contact Dan Shaw for full specification: an exceptional boat with great interior
    and extensive list of extras.
