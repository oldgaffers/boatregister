  *Susan J* is a Heard 28, built in 1991 by Gaffers and Luggers and has cruised
  extensively.
full_description: |-
  *Susan J's* first owners took her through the French canals and cruised the
  Mediterranean. She had a complete refit during 2001 - 2002 at Sandbanks Yacht
  Company, Poole, including a new bowsprit, rigging, teak work and electrics.


  With her second owners, the Shaws, she sailed to the Channel Islands, Normandy
  and Brittany coasts, west coast of England and the Scilly Islands from her base
  in the Solent. In 2003 she sailed around Britain and in 2013 took part in the
  OGA Jubilee celebrations in Cowes. She attended the 10th Anniversary Tour with
  the Dutch OGA in 2014.


  Changing hands in 2017, as her new owners, we took her on the OGA Sou' by Sou'
  West Cruise when she reached the Scilly Islands. She attended the OGA 55
  celebrations in Cowes and in 2019 cruised to North Brittany.


  Her 27 year old Perkins engine was replaced with a Beta 28 in 2018, by David
  Llewellin of DL Marine, St Just in Roseland. We have upgraded her 12 V charging
  systems and overhauled the Taylor parafin stove. Her Simpson Lawrence manual
  windlass, Taylor gas cooker (and supply) were overhauled, during the lockdown.
  Her spars were removed, overhauled and rigging simplified in 2020/21 by David
  Carne and team at Riggers UK in Penryn Since Covid, as well as the south coast
  of Devon and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly most years, she has cruised to
  Guernsey in 2021 and Milford Haven in May 2022.


  We are hoping that *Susan J* will join the OGA60 Round Britain Cruise from
  Plymouth in May 2023.

    A Heard 28 Falmouth Workboat hull, built by Gaffers and Luggers in 1991, and
    fitted out by Traditional Yacht Services in 1992 on the Isle of Wight. One
    previous owner, sleeps five. Sale includes extensive list of Raymarine
    instruments chartplotter/radar. VHF Navtex and more. Well equipped for cruising.


    GRP hull, ply covered deck, teak superstructure with painted Brazilian mahoganhy
    coachouse sides. Perkins Parama 30hp three cylinder diesel engine, fresh water
    cooled. LOD 28", LWL 26.6", Draft 5.3", LOA 41", Beam 9.9"


    We have had "Susan J" since October 1999. We have found her to be a very fast
    and stable cruising boat. Whether sailing with two or four people she has proved
    to be comfortable for a boat only 28" in length. Cruising ground includes
    sailing round Britain, frequent cruises to France and Holland. "Susan J" is a
    one off, built to a high standard on the Heard 28 hull. She is in very good
    order having had a major refit in 2002 and well maintained by professionals on
    an annual basis ever since. The boat has been wintered ashore every year. The
    professionally finished interior certainly makes this boat top of the list if
    you are looking for a modern boat with traditional styling and rig.


    Contact Dan Shaw for full specification: an exceptional boat with great interior
    and extensive list of extras.
