full_description: "<p>On 12 May, 2017, &#39;Shireen&#39;, the restored 19/24 class\
  \ Clyde racing yacht was relaunched at Holy Loch Marina, Sandbank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based\
  \ on records kept by a previous owner, the Yachting Life article summarises some\
  \ of her early history. She appears in the 19/24 class book in 1932, owned by a\
  \ Mr Lawson who won the Royal Gourock Yacht Club Cup that year. During the Second\
  \ World War, she was kept on Inchmurrin, Loch Lomond. She was used to transport\
  \ animals and deliver the mail, with fuel being in short supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since\
  \ then she has had a chequered history and spent some time lying in the open which\
  \ led to the need for some major repairs done by Ronnie McGrouther of McKellars\
  \ slipway.</p>"
