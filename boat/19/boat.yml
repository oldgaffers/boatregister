  *Shireen* is a Clyde 19/24, built in 1900 in the Royal
  Burgh of Rutherglen by Ewing McGruer.
full_description: |-
  On 12 May, 2017, *Shireen*, the restored 19/24 class
  Clyde racing yacht was relaunched at Holy Loch Marina, Sandbank.
  
  Based on records kept by a previous owner, the Yachting Life article summarises some
  of her early history. She appears in the 19/24 class book in 1932, owned by a
  Mr Lawson who won the Royal Gourock Yacht Club Cup that year. During the Second
  World War, she was kept on Inchmurrin, Loch Lomond. She was used to transport
  animals and deliver the mail, with fuel being in short supply.
  
  Since then she has had a chequered history and spent some time lying in the open which
  led to the need for some major repairs done by Ronnie McGrouther of McKellars
  slipway.
