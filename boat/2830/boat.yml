full_description: |-
  Shortly after her build *Ragamuffin* was sold to The Netherlands,
  where she remained for many years. The boat and her owner played an important
  role in the OGA-NL history. In 2016, she changed hands and *Ragamuffin*
  was commissioned by Whaleboat for an overhaul with new paint finish, antifouling
  etc, completed in late 2018. She was sold and brought back to the UK in 2020.
