full_description: "<p><em>Dagmar</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;was built by James A Silver Ltd&nbsp;at\
  \ Rosneath on the Clyde in 1935, for Captain W Ivan Nicholson, of Blythe, Northumberland.\
  \ Her designer, John Bain, was best known for&nbsp;Motor boats, but Dagmar was not\
  \ his only auxiliary yacht.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometime during WW2 she came into the\
  \ ownership of EJA Freeman, MC, who kept her first at Ipswich and later at Maldon.\
  \ She remained in the area under the ownership of F Whitacker who bought her in\
  \ 1955, and kept her until at least 1973 after which she disappears from the Lloyds\
  \ register of Yachts. She was given her first engine change since new in this year,\
  \ with her original Stuart Turner being replaced by a reconditioned Vire.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p><em>Dagmar</em> was rescued from the mud in Fareham Creek in 1993, by Alan&nbsp;West\
  \ of Petersfield, who spent the next ten years renovating her, including fitting\
  \ a new Yanmar engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She came first in class in the Round the Island\
  \ Race in 2017, before being sold&nbsp; in 2019.</p>"
