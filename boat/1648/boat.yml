full_description: The owner of this craft acquired her in 1975, she was then just
  the hull of a smack named "Zareha".  During four years of rebuilding she had new
  deck beams, deck, bear, shelf, breast hook, mast and rigging plus spars.  She sank
  in a gale in 1980 but was refloated and has had a new rudder fitted.  Her history
  tells us that she was a smack yacht at Wallasea Island in the Crouch, her names
  have been Six Bells, Johnny Belinda and Zareha. She was towed into the Crouch in
  1954 by the Clacton Lifeboat when she was named Johnny Belinda, but the present
  owner is trying to find out more about her.
