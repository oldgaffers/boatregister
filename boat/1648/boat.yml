full_description: |-
  The owner of this craft acquired her in 1975, she was then just the hull of a
  smack named *Zareha*. During four years of rebuilding she had new deck beams,
  deck, bear, shelf, breast hook, mast and rigging plus spars. She sank in a gale
  in 1980 but was refloated and has had a new rudder fitted. Her history tells us
  that she was a smack yacht at Wallasea Island in the Crouch, her names have been
  *Six Bells*, *Johnny Belinda* and *Zareha*. She was towed into the Crouch in
  1954 by the Clacton Lifeboat when she was named *Johnny Belinda*, but the
  present owner is trying to find out more about her.
