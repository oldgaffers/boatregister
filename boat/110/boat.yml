full_description: |-
  Originally a dayboat, 'Devon Maid' had a coachroof added in the 1930s. During
  the Second World War she was sunk as part of a barrage.


  In 1958 she was found sailing in the Alderney Race with no-one on board and was
  taken to Guernsey by the pilots, one of whom was the father of David Bisson, who
  bought her in 2009. She took part in the first OGA Solent Race in 1959 under her
  then owner, Fiona Beale, who then took her to the Helford River, which has been
  her home port ever since.


  Fiona Beale owned her for 50 years.

    OFFERS   An enthusiast urgently sought to save Devon Maid. Back of an envelope
    conservative value of salvageable parts from iron keel upwards, including Beta
    20 engine (450hrs) tops £14,400. Teak covering board, toe rail and other parts
    removed available to replace. Sadly effects of a stroke prevent me from doing
    the work myself and the boatbuilder commissioned, having started, has decided to
    decline without carte blanche for a rebuild with ply deck instead of existing
    pitch pine planking which is almost wholly good for several more years. This
    would spoil her in my view and makes the job too expensive as said ill health
    forces me to part with the boat anyway. It breaks my heart to consider scrapping
    this beautiful old lady. If you persuade me you can love her as much as I have
    I’ll virtually give her away!


    Devon Maid was built as a gentleman’s day boat in 1914. Expect to be the centre
    of attention as she’s such a pretty classic, easily sailed by 2. The cabin was
    added in the 1930s, full standing headroom. In 2009 the interior was
    reconfigured to accommodate 2 berths and a small galley. Heads curtained off
    forward. Beta 20 engine fitted 2014. James Lawrence mainsail 2018, Mizzen SKB
    2010, both topsails new 2010. Trysail and mizzen staysails. S/s standing rigging
    and guard rails renewed 2009. Rudder tube and shaft replaced in s/s 2008. Garmin
    GPS chart plotter, Standard Horizon DSC VHF and all you need to cook and serve a
    feast for 4 on board. New winter and summer covers. Warps, fenders, main CQR
    anchor and CQR kedge with ropes and chains. Engine battery and 2 leisure
    batteries. New solar panel. Shore power connector in cupboard. Main mast
    unstepped 2021. Quotes from insurance survey 2021 “exceptionally good for her
    age” “has benefitted greatly from being owned and well maintained over the last
    several years by a professional boat builder.” Beken photograph of Devon Maid
