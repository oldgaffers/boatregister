full_description: "Gaff cutter 'Inanda' was built by Whisstocks in 1949 and is the\
  \ roomier version that had an extra plank added to her shear as most did after the\
  \ war. She is a sturdy little pocket cruiser in very good sound condition having\
  \ had much work done  to her over the years. The sails are excellent and set very\
  \ well. The engine is a  Volvo 10hp which has been utterly reliable and very economcal.\
  \ A new sump pan and engine mounts were fitted in 2017. The rigging is galvanised\
  \ wire and sound with running rigging and blocks replaced around 2010.\r\n\r\nDown\
  \ below there are two full length berths with room for one in the fo'c'sle.  To\
  \ port is a two burner Origo meths stove. To starboard there is a hanging locker.\
  \ 'Inanda' sails really well for her size and has competed successfully in local\
  \ OGA races."
