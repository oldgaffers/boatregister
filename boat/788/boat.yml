  \ well. The engine is a\_ Volvo 10hp which has been utterly reliable and very economcal.\
  \ A new sump pan and engine mounts were fitted in 2017.\_The rigging is galvanised\
  \ wire and sound with running rigging and blocks replaced around 2010.\r\n\r\nDown\
  \ below there are two full length berths with room for one in the fo'c'sle.\_ To\
  \ port is a two burner Origo meths stove. To starboard there is\_a hanging locker.\
  \ 'Inanda' sails really well for her size and has competed successfully in local\
  \ OGA races."
