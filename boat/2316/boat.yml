short_description: |-
  Launched with a sloop rig, during her first winter ashore a canoe stern and
  mizzen was added.
full_description: "*Maid of Lorne* was built at McKellar's Slipway, Kilcreggan in\
  \ 1908 to a design by Alfred Mylne. The yard later became McGrouthers.   \nAs originally\
  \ built, she was a transom stern sloop. She was altered to a canoe yawl in time\
  \ for the 1909 season, less than a year after McKellar's had launched her. One conceivable\
  \ inspiration for the change may have been that the Albert Strange, *Sheila* (1904)\
  \ was based on the Clyde in 1908. The two yawls have very similar dimensions, and\
  \ not dissimilar sail areas. However,her deck plan could not have been the same\
  \ as Mylne had drawn for the sloop, though there were photographs of it. A canoe\
  \ stern is visible as a hand-drawn addition to her original plans. There are butt\
  \ joints on her planking where the canoe stern was added.   \n*Maid of Lorn* was\
  \ owned for most of the 1930 by Gladys Coulson, who married Ian G Gilchrist, marine\
  \ photographer. Needless to say, from the 1930s to the 50s he contributed lots of\
  \ photographs of the boat to the yachting press. Later, the main was converted to\
  \ Bermudan and a rather unsightly cabin top was added to provide standing headroom\
  \ below.   \n John Blackie rescued her in the 1980s and restored her to her 1909\
  \ condition.   \nIn 2007, Mark Butler at James Lawrence made copies of a set of\
  \ her unusable vertically panelled tanned sails which had not been used since the\
  \ early 1950s.Cranfield (of Burnham on Crouch) had provided sails in 1930 and, assuming\
  \ this was indeed the case, their style and details indicate they were copies of\
  \ her first set.   \nToday, she is the sole small Edwardian cruising yacht of Mylne\
  \ design to survive. She is also the oldest yacht in sailing order on the Clyde.\
  \   \nAside from her liking for being cosseted, *Maid of Lorn* has a vice that can\
  \ be made to disappear simply enough. She carries weather helm when under full main,\
  \ but which is simply curable by taking in a single reef. She stays upright and\
  \ cuts through waves and happily sails under mizzen and jib alone."
