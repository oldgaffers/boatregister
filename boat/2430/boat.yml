  Built in 1922, 'Charm' is one of several boats with the same name attributed to
  Albert Strange. She has had a chequered history, with more than one restoration.
full_description: "### Restoring 'Charm' (2000 - 2006) by Russell Read\n\n\nFirst\
  \ published in Gaffers Log, September 2006\n\n\n\n> \n> In writing this piece it\
  \ occurs to me that others too may be tired of the\n> typical restoration write-up,\
  \ lovingly detailing each and every component\n> replaced and that an interesting\
  \ alternative might be a more human angle on the\n> trials and tribulations of the\
  \ owner/restorer, and perhaps a list of pitfalls\n> for the unwary. In other words\
  \ a resounding Don’t Do It! So here goes.\n> \n> \n> Considered rationally, ie my\
  \ wife’s view, it looked like a bad idea right from\n> the start Find a dilapidated\
  \ wooden boat which when restored would be unsuitable\n> for us, a retired couple\
  \ out of the archetypal mould; he enthusiastic, she wary\n> and happier in the garden;\
  \ pour into the project a huge amount of money (which\n> we didn’t possess of course)\
  \ far in excess of the vessel’s potential value;\n> continue living where we were,\
  \ far from the sea; and finally sign up as a sort\n> of superannuated apprentice\
  \ to a professional boat builder who would sensibly\n> regard that apprentice’s\
  \ role as being to make tea, sweep up, and only\n> eventually, grudgingly, allow\
  \ the most boring and menial tasks to be carried out\n> on the boat itself.\n> \n\
  > \n> Yes, this was to be a retirement project. A way of achieving a painless\n\
  > transition from a busy and stressful working life to a busy, stressful\n> retirement.\
  \ In this respect at least it couldn’t have been better.\n> \n> \n> ‘Charm’, already\
  \ known to me for many years, was rediscovered in a far corner of\n> an Essex boatyard,\
  \ looking forlorn and very wet. She was built in 1922, a 33ft\n> counter-stern gaff\
  \ yawl, and a slightly stretched version (by one-eighth) of the\n> Albert Strange\
  \ ‘Venture’ which was his last design (he died in 1917).\n> Potentially very pretty.\
  \ My wife, misunderstanding my sales pitch, commented\n> that if I were at last\
  \ to acquire charm she would indeed be delighted; so I\n> quickly took advantage\
  \ and handed over the modest purchase price.\n> \n> \n> Trundled home to our back\
  \ garden in rural Bucks., the boat proceeded to sit for\n> a year waiting for my\
  \ actual retirement. During that year I tackled a few tasks\n> like cleaning up\
  \ the name boards (very urgent that, anything to show that the\n> job was underway)\
  \ and chipping away ineffectively at many layers of (probably\n> lead-based) paint,\
  \ including the antifouling which a previous hopeful had\n> somewhat prematurely\
  \ applied.\n> \n> \n> Then, in the first 18 months of real retirement, came the\
  \ big push forward.\n> 'Charm' was moved to the boat builders’ shed, on an Essex\
  \ farm near Maldon, and\n> then for me began a commuting existence, inevitably via\
  \ the M25, and averaging\n> three days on and four off, time for partial recovery,\
  \ and whilst ‘on’ living in\n> an old caravan parked on the farm. An extract from\
  \ my diary at the time\n> describes something of life through the first winter:\
  \ “When the farmer first\n> showed us to our pitch he referred to the wonderful\
  \ sense of solitude we could\n> expect in this remote part of Essex. He spoke truly.\
  \ Tucked up inside the\n> caravan on this freezing winters evening, with something\
  \ shrieking outside\n> (could be owls; could be demented locals) there is solitude\
  \ to spare.”\n> \n> \n> A few other memories of the project at this time, during\
  \ which morale could be\n> quite difficult to sustain: the frequent sense at the\
  \ end of a very long day\n> that we were further away from a restored boat than\
  \ we had been that morning:\n> feeling that 90% of the tasks I was assigned (when\
  \ eventually deemed capable\n> enough) like making in-situ scarfe joints for instance,\
  \ would have been easier\n> had I not been left-handed, let alone cack-handed: and\
  \ thinking when endlessly\n> loading the pot-bellied stove, our only source of heat\
  \ during the winter, with\n> scrap wood - often discarded planking - that ‘Burning\
  \ your Boats’ was indeed a\n> relevant phrase.\n> \n> \n> But at the same time there\
  \ were compensations. Discovering that wooden boat\n> construction is fascinating:\
  \ a mix of often very crude technology (the lash-ups\n> we used for steaming timber\
  \ for instance) coupled with incredible skill, such as\n> shaping a plank to fit\
  \ precisely into a complex three-dimensional space between\n> two others. Slowly\
  \ even I acquired a few basic skills by watching the others at\n> work.\n> \n> \n\
  > At the end of this period both I and the original funds were exhausted, so a\n\
  > structurally-complete but far from finished hull returned to our back garden.\n\
  > Worse still, this was at about the time, nearly three years in, when the boat\n\
  > should have been out there and sailing, if things had gone according to plan.\n\
  > \n> \n> Another year passed. Slow, slow progress, without any helpful voice at\
  \ my elbow\n> to say ‘you’re doing it all wrong’. Amazingly however, in a village\
  \ 100 miles\n> from the coast, there was now another sea-going boat, a home-completion\
  \ Hunter\n> 31, right next door. So a fair amount of two-way moral and practical\
  \ support\n> ensued; better-still, this invaluable neighbour possessed a serious\
  \ workshop\n> equipped with a band saw, planer-thicknesser for a task involving\
  \ him, initially\n> at least, in GRP construction!\n> \n> \n> Furthermore the race\
  \ was on: who would be afloat first? [He was, dammit.]\n> \n> \n> Eventually, the\
  \ house re-mortgaged, holidays away a thing of the past, it was\n> the final push.\
  \ We were back down to Maldon for caulking, then painting,\n> painting and more\
  \ painting, and finally being dumped without much ceremony into\n> a mud-berth to\
  \ ‘take up’ (after perhaps 20 years out of the water). We took a\n> triumphant maiden\
  \ voyage, sans rig but under engine (a new Betamarine) and\n> almost leak-free,\
  \ down the Blackwater.\n> \n> \n> Then last summer, and after five long years, everything\
  \ else came together, and\n> surprisingly quickly; rigging, spars, and sails, the\
  \ latter a beautifully made\n> suit in Clipper canvas. Not that even then she was\
  \ really finished of course.\n> But there was nothing for it but to go out for a\
  \ proper sail, and hope for a few\n> admiring comments. Inevitably no-one said very\
  \ much: the East Coast is a bit\n> blasé about pretty boats. But for me; at last\
  \ it all seemed to have been\n> worthwhile.\n> \n> \n>"
