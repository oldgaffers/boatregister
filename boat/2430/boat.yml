full_description: "<h3>Restoring &#39;Charm&#39; (2000 - 2006) by Russell Read</h3>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>First published in Gaffers Log, September 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In\
  \ writing this piece it occurs to me that others too may be tired of the typical\
  \ restoration write-up, lovingly detailing each and every component replaced and\
  \ that an interesting alternative might be a more human angle on the trials and\
  \ tribulations of the owner/restorer, and perhaps a list of pitfalls for the unwary.\
  \ In other words a resounding Don&rsquo;t Do It! So here goes.</blockquote>\r\n\r\
  \n<blockquote>Considered rationally, ie my wife&rsquo;s view, it looked like a bad\
  \ idea right from the start Find a dilapidated wooden boat which when restored would\
  \ be unsuitable for us, a retired couple out of the archetypal mould; he enthusiastic,\
  \ she wary and happier in the garden; pour into the project a huge amount of money\
  \ (which we didn&rsquo;t possess of course) far in excess of the vessel&rsquo;s\
  \ potential value; continue living where we were, far from the sea; and finally\
  \ sign up as a sort of superannuated apprentice to a professional boat builder who\
  \ would sensibly regard that apprentice&rsquo;s role as being to make tea, sweep\
  \ up, and only eventually, grudgingly, allow the most boring and menial tasks to\
  \ be carried out on the boat itself.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Yes, this was\
  \ to be a retirement project. A way of achieving a painless transition from a busy\
  \ and stressful working life to a busy, stressful retirement. In this respect at\
  \ least it couldn&rsquo;t have been better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Charm&rsquo;,\
  \ already known to me for many years, was rediscovered in a far corner of an Essex\
  \ boatyard, looking forlorn and very wet. She was built in 1922, a 33ft counter-stern\
  \ gaff yawl, and a slightly stretched version (by one-eighth) of the Albert Strange\
  \ &lsquo;Venture&rsquo; which was his last design (he died in 1917). Potentially\
  \ very pretty. My wife, misunderstanding my sales pitch, commented that if I were\
  \ at last to acquire charm she would indeed be delighted; so I quickly took advantage\
  \ and handed over the modest purchase price.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Trundled\
  \ home to our back garden in rural Bucks., the boat proceeded to sit for a year\
  \ waiting for my actual retirement. During that year I tackled a few tasks like\
  \ cleaning up the name boards (very urgent that, anything to show that the job was\
  \ underway) and chipping away ineffectively at many layers of (probably lead-based)\
  \ paint, including the antifouling which a previous hopeful had somewhat prematurely\
  \ applied.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Then, in the first 18 months of real\
  \ retirement, came the big push forward. &#39;Charm&#39; was moved to the boat builders&rsquo;\
  \ shed, on an Essex farm near Maldon, and then for me began a commuting existence,\
  \ inevitably via the M25, and averaging three days on and four off, time for partial\
  \ recovery, and whilst &lsquo;on&rsquo; living in an old caravan parked on the farm.\
  \ An extract from my diary at the time describes something of life through the first\
  \ winter: &ldquo;When the farmer first showed us to our pitch he referred to the\
  \ wonderful sense of solitude we could expect in this remote part of Essex. He spoke\
  \ truly. Tucked up inside the caravan on this freezing winters evening, with something\
  \ shrieking outside (could be owls; could be demented locals) there is solitude\
  \ to spare.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A few other memories of the project\
  \ at this time, during which morale could be quite difficult to sustain: the frequent\
  \ sense at the end of a very long day that we were further away from a restored\
  \ boat than we had been that morning: feeling that 90% of the tasks I was assigned\
  \ (when eventually deemed capable enough) like making in-situ scarfe joints for\
  \ instance, would have been easier had I not been left-handed, let alone cack-handed:\
  \ and thinking when endlessly loading the pot-bellied stove, our only source of\
  \ heat during the winter, with scrap wood - often discarded planking - that &lsquo;Burning\
  \ your Boats&rsquo; was indeed a relevant phrase.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>But\
  \ at the same time there were compensations. Discovering that wooden boat construction\
  \ is fascinating: a mix of often very crude technology (the lash-ups we used for\
  \ steaming timber for instance) coupled with incredible skill, such as shaping a\
  \ plank to fit precisely into a complex three-dimensional space between two others.\
  \ Slowly even I acquired a few basic skills by watching the others at work.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>At the end of this period both I and the original funds were exhausted,\
  \ so a structurally-complete but far from finished hull returned to our back garden.\
  \ Worse still, this was at about the time, nearly three years in, when the boat\
  \ should have been out there and sailing, if things had gone according to plan.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<blockquote>Another year passed. Slow, slow progress, without any helpful\
  \ voice at my elbow to say &lsquo;you&rsquo;re doing it all wrong&rsquo;. Amazingly\
  \ however, in a village 100 miles from the coast, there was now another sea-going\
  \ boat, a home-completion Hunter 31, right next door. So a fair amount of two-way\
  \ moral and practical support ensued; better-still, this invaluable neighbour possessed\
  \ a serious workshop equipped with a band saw, planer-thicknesser for a task involving\
  \ him, initially at least, in GRP construction!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Furthermore\
  \ the race was on: who would be afloat first? [He was, dammit.]</blockquote>\r\n\
  \r\n<blockquote>Eventually, the house re-mortgaged, holidays away a thing of the\
  \ past, it was the final push. We were back down to Maldon for caulking, then painting,\
  \ painting and more painting, and finally being dumped without much ceremony into\
  \ a mud-berth to &lsquo;take up&rsquo; (after perhaps 20 years out of the water).\
  \ We took a triumphant maiden voyage, sans rig but under engine (a new Betamarine)\
  \ and almost leak-free, down the Blackwater.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Then\
  \ last summer, and after five long years, everything else came together, and surprisingly\
  \ quickly; rigging, spars, and sails, the latter a beautifully made suit in Clipper\
  \ canvas. Not that even then she was really finished of course. But there was nothing\
  \ for it but to go out for a proper sail, and hope for a few admiring comments.\
  \ Inevitably no-one said very much: the East Coast is a bit blas&eacute; about pretty\
  \ boats. But for me; at last it all seemed to have been worthwhile.</blockquote>"
