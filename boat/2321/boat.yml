short_description: <p>Norfolk Broads Yacht, &#39;Dragonfly&#39; was built by Bunn

full_description: "<p>First published in Gaffers Log, November 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\
  \n<p>&#39;Dragonfly&#39; was built 1905 Herbert Bunn, Wroxham, Norfolk to the highest\
  \ standards for Stanley Day a Norwich actuary. She was constructed of Russian redwood\
  \ on oak frames; mahogany cabin sides, well [cockpit] and interior. Part of the\
  \ brief was that &#39;Dragonfly&#39; be able to reach all the navigable waters of\
  \ the Norfolk Broads, meaning that she must go under Potter Heigham bridge, and\
  \ old Ludham bridge. This, given her length, accounts for her elegance, enhanced\
  \ by the unusual oval cabin deadlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was close going under Potter\
  \ Heigham, and we used to use the underneath of the arch to push her through. There\
  \ was a specially low crutch to support the lowered mast for low bridges. The hull\
  \ was of typical Broads &lsquo;skimming dish&rsquo; form, with fairly fine forward\
  \ sections. Off the wind, the bows would set down quite noticeably and it was exciting\
  \ to be on the foredeck and see the bow wave curling up to the level of the rail.\
  \ I remember Uncle George sometimes ordering the moveable lead counterweight slabs,\
  \ I suppose they each weighed about 28 lb, aft from the forepeak to place under\
  \ the well sole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical Broads lowering mast stepped well forward\
  \ in a massive tabernacle to allow as much space for accommodation as possible.\
  \ The forepeak was originally for the paid hand, Burton, who used to look after\
  \ &#39;Dragonfly&#39; in the winter. It contained a small galley and a pipe cot,\
  \ that became my berth, and the massive lead counterweight for the mast, to which\
  \ extra pieces could be added to adjust the balance. Even in our ownership, there\
  \ was no other galley, but there was a gas ring on a flexible connection in one\
  \ of the cockpit lockers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aft of the mast was the heads to port, and\
  \ a hatch to starboard. Then a sleeping cabin with bunks each side and a pretty\
  \ wash basin, draining into the centreplate casing in the next cabin. The coachroof\
  \ had a lifting section in the centre, but not hinged like some, it had folding\
  \ mahogany sides so it sat level when assembled. Aft of this was the saloon, which\
  \ also provided two berths. The drop-leaf table was built onto the centreplate casing,\
  \ with its tackle, using bronze blocks, on the bulkhead. Skylight over. All the\
  \ cabin panelling was in mahogany. Dragonfly was built without a bowsprit. I believe\
  \ Uncle Stanley raced her and I was told that mainly for this reason, he had a bowsprit\
  \ fitted within a couple of seasons, carrying a much larger foresail &ndash; she\
  \ was never cutter-rigged. The modification might also have been to try to correct\
  \ the marked weather helm when well heeled, presumably due to the changed waterplane.\
  \ The keel also had pieces added to the fore and aft edges.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\
