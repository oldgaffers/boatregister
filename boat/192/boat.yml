full_description: "<p>&#39;Bird of Dawning&#39; was launched in 1937 at Paglesham\
  \ in Essex, and was built by Frank Shuttlewood in the old black shed (constructed\
  \ partly out of the timber from Darwin&rsquo;s &#39;Beagle&#39;) that still stands\
  \ by the side of the river Roach. H Kemloe, her first owner, enjoyed only a couple\
  \ of years with her before the war that sadly killed him intervened. She spent the\
  \ war years on the beach at Whitstable in the yard of R J Dudley &amp; Perkins,\
  \ well covered up and maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shuttlewood family were builders\
  \ of smacks and Thames barges, but as the demand for those declined after the First\
  \ World War the family was forced to diversify, and in the growth of yachting they\
  \ seized an opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though &#39;Bird of Dawning&#39; looks to\
  \ all intents and purposes like an oyster smack, her underwater shape is more yacht\
  \ like, deeper and with outside ballast. With a fine entry and broad shoulders,\
  \ she is a fast and seaworthy vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1946 Julian Mannering&#39;s\
  \ father, John, bought her and sailed her, engineless, out of Dover for twenty years.\
  \ She was bought by Wilf James in 1966 who kept her on the Blackwater. He sold her\
  \ to John Harris in 1985 and she then passed to Chris and Sue Briggs in 1993.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She was purchased by Julian and Amanda Mannering in 1997 and has, since\
  \ then, been based at Hollowshore just off the River Swale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sails\
  \ are by Steve Hall of North Sea Sails in Tollesbury, and all traditionally finished.\
  \ Her cruising grounds are the Thames estuary, the Channel and the nearby continental\
  \ coasts.</p>"
