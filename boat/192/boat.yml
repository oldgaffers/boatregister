short_description: <p>&#39;Bird of Dawning&#39; is a smack yacht, built for H Kemloe
  and launched on 17 July 1937. She&#39;s designed on the lines of an Essex oyster
  smack.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Bird of Dawning&#39; was launched in 1937 at Paglesham
  in Essex, and was built by Frank Shuttlewood in the old black shed (constructed
  partly out of the timber from Darwin&rsquo;s &#39;Beagle&#39;) that still stands
  by the side of the river Roach. H Kemloe, her first owner, enjoyed only a couple
  of years with her before the war that sadly killed him intervened. She spent the
  war years on the beach at Whitstable in the yard of R J Dudley &amp; Perkins, well
  covered up and maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shuttlewood family were builders of
  smacks and Thames barges, but as the demand for those declined after the First World
  War the family was forced to diversify, and in the growth of yachting they seized
  an opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though &#39;Bird of Dawning&#39; looks to all intents
  and purposes like an oyster smack, her underwater shape is more yacht like, deeper
  and with outside ballast. With a fine entry and broad shoulders, she is a fast and
  seaworthy vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1946 Julian Mannering&#39;s father, John, bought
  her and sailed her, engineless, out of Dover for twenty years. She was bought by
  Wilf James in 1966 who kept her on the Blackwater. He sold her to John Harris in
  1985 and she then passed to Chris and Sue Briggs in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was
  purchased by Julian and Amanda Mannering in 1997 and has, since then, been based
  at Hollowshore just off the River Swale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sails are by Steve Hall of
  North Sea Sails in Tollesbury, and all traditionally finished. Her cruising grounds
  are the Thames estuary, the Channel and the nearby continental coasts.</p>"
