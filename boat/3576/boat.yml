full_description: <p>Like most Heard 28's, Freydis is a unique version of the popular
  Dalton design. With a well-balanced and easily handled powerful rig, and a seaworthy
  hull, she's a confidence inspiring, go anywhere boat. She is equipped with a separate
  head and spacious forward &nbsp;V berth and enjoys an airy interior due to the large
  lantern skylight. There is also a diesel powered cabin stove to keep her comfortable
  when living aboard.&nbsp;</p>
