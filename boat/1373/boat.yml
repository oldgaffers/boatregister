full_description: '<p>Ian Clarke summarises ownership from 1956: &quot;&#39;Straight
  Across&#39; was owned by my grandfather from 1956-1974, after which it was sold
  causing a big family rift! This was resolved by buying it back again in 1983, and
  we have owned it since, mainly on the upper Thames at Freebody&#39;s boatyard in
  Hurley, but for a few seasons have cruised the East Coast.&quot;</p>'
