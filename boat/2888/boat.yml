short_description: Bonify was built between 1980 and 1993 to the lines of the American
  Carol class cutter, designed in 1924 by John Hanna as a big sister to his more famous
  Tahiti ketch.
full_description: "<p>Bonify&#39;s hull is ferro cement but the decks are pitch pine\
  \ on oak and the spars are Douglas fir. So far (and who knows) Bonify has not been\
  \ rigged as a ketch. Based on the Tahiti Ketch, John Hanna&#39;s design for the\
  \ Carol in 1924 was for an ocean-worthy ketch. However, Bonify was built as a single\
  \ masted gaff cutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was built near Colchester, taking over 13\
  \ years to complete, and then went to the west coast of Scotland with a new owner.\
  \ By coincidence she is now kept in Ipswich only yards from where she was first\
  \ launched. Her current owners have added a cockpit and doghouse. Her relatively\
  \ shallow draft is very suitable for sailing on the East Coast of England and she\
  \ regularly crosses the North Sea to Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In\
  \ 2013 Bonify took part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge. Read the <a href=\"\
