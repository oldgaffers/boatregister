short_description: Bonify was built between 1980 and 1993 to the lines of the American
  Carol class cutter, designed in 1924 by John Hanna as a big sister to his more famous
  Tahiti ketch.
full_description: "<p>Bonify&#39;s hull is ferro cement but the decks are pitch pine
  on oak and the spars are Douglas fir. So far (and who knows) Bonify has not been
  rigged as a ketch. Based on the Tahiti Ketch, John Hanna&#39;s design for the Carol
  in 1924 was for an ocean-worthy ketch. However, Bonify was built as a single masted
  gaff cutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was built near Colchester, taking over 13 years to
  complete, and then went to the west coast of Scotland with a new owner. By coincidence
  she is now kept in Ipswich only yards from where she was first launched. Her current
  owners have added a cockpit and doghouse. Her relatively shallow draft is very suitable
  for sailing on the East Coast of England and she regularly crosses the North Sea
  to Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 Bonify took part in the OGA
  Round Britain Challenge. Read the <a href=\"http://www.classicboat.co.uk/news/sue-lewis-oga-blog/\"\
