full_description: "<p>&#39;Amanda&#39; is thought to have been built for Annan owners\
  \ in 1920, and may originally have been called &#39;Olive&#39;. Annan is on the\
  \ Solway Firth in Scotland and was an important fishing port with 70 boats in 1900.\
  \ Youngs make potted shrimps in the town. Shrimp trawling was started in Annan in\
  \ the 1850s by fishermen from Morecambe (or Poulton-le-Sands as it was known then\
  \ known). Crossfields made a number of boats for the Annan trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\
  \n<p>Since 1979 &#39;Amanda&#39; has been kept on the Wirral at West Kirby and used\
  \ for cruising. West Kirby is on the River Dee side of he Wirral and has become\
  \ one of the main sailing centres in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was purchased in\
  \ 2018 by a new&nbsp;owner who plans to bring her to Arnside in 2020 on her way\
  \ to Annan to celebrate her centenary.</p>"
