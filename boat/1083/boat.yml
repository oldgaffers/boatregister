short_description: '*Amanda* was built in 1920 by Crossfields of Arnside.'
full_description: "*Amanda* is thought to have been built for Annan owners\n in 1920,\
  \ and may originally have been called *Olive*. Annan is on the\n Solway Firth in\
  \ Scotland and was an important fishing port with 70 boats in 1900.\n\n Youngs make\
  \ potted shrimps in the town. Shrimp trawling was started in Annan in\n the 1850s\
  \ by fishermen from Morecambe (or Poulton-le-Sands as it was known then\n known).\n\
  \ \n Crossfields made a number of boats for the Annan trade. \n\n Since 1979 *Amanda*\
  \ has been kept on the Wirral at West Kirby and used\n for cruising. West Kirby\
  \ is on the River Dee side of he Wirral and has become\n one of the main sailing\
  \ centres in the area. She was purchased in\n 2018 by a new owner who planned to\
  \ bring her to Arnside in 2020 on her way\n to Annan to celebrate her centenary."
