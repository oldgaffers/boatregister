  *Amanda* was built in 1920 by Crossfields of Arnside.
full_description: |-
  *Amanda* is thought to have been built for Annan owners
   in 1920, and may originally have been called *Olive*. Annan is on the
   Solway Firth in Scotland and was an important fishing port with 70 boats in 1900.

   Youngs make potted shrimps in the town. Shrimp trawling was started in Annan in
   the 1850s by fishermen from Morecambe (or Poulton-le-Sands as it was known then
   known).
   
   Crossfields made a number of boats for the Annan trade. 

   Since 1979 *Amanda* has been kept on the Wirral at West Kirby and used
   for cruising. West Kirby is on the River Dee side of he Wirral and has become
   one of the main sailing centres in the area. She was purchased in
   2018 by a new owner who planned to bring her to Arnside in 2020 on her way
   to Annan to celebrate her centenary.
