full_description: "<p>&#39;Tammie&#39; was built for the sailmaker George Ratsey as\
  \ a gaff cutter. In the 1920s she was owned by Charles Nicholson and in the 1930s\
  \ by John Nicholson when she was sailed energetically in the Solent. By this stage\
  \ she had been converted to a Bermudan cutter. She was re-rigged for racing after\
  \ the Second World War. Originally she was flush-decked, with the companion way\
  \ and skylight and recorded as having little headroom. Even with the coachroof,\
  \ there is not much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, she was purchased by Nicholas Hall.\
  \ She was lying at Hayling Yacht Co. on a drying pontoon, where she had been for\
  \ many years. The Yanmar 2 QM engine has been removed for overhaul and the port\
  \ side has been re-caulked. The starboard side, coachroof and deck also need some\
  \ attention.</p>"

    The original Certificate of British Registry records the last owner as Guy Charles
    Garbett Hutton, from 19 July 1971. He had owned her with other members of his
    family from 1968. The document has suffered very much from damp so not all the
    entries are legible. It is interesting to see that she had an engine when first
    registered.
