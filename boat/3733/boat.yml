full_description: |-
  Falcon II was built in 1936 and remained available to hire until the early
  1960's. After passing into private ownership she was sailed on the Norfolk
  Broads regularly until 1997. During this time various alterations were made to
  her length and keel to improve her sailing qualities. In 1997 Falcon II was
  taken to the International Boat Building College in Lowestoft where she would
  remain for around 15 years. By 2012 her then owner had completed a major refit
  and restoration. Little is known of what happend over the next 7 years but by
  2019 and suffering from neglect, major work was needed once again. A change of
  ownership (only her 4th owner since leaving the hire fleet of John Loynes) and
  initial refurbishment works were completed by the summer of 2021 which included
  a new keel, planking and a new engine. Built with Oak Frames and Iroko Planking,
  she is unusal for a Broads Yacht due to her teak decks. The cabin side and
  cockpit are mahogony and the mast, boom, gaff and bow sprit are Douglas fir.
  With her restoration more or less complete, Falcon II is proffessionally
  maintained at a boatyard in Wroxham and is now regularly sailed on the broads
  once more.
