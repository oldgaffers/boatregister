full_description: "<p>&#39;Charles Henry Ashley&#39; was in service at Cemaes, Anglesey\
  \ 1907 - 1932, then in storage at Cemlyn in ownership of Captain Hewitt.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>She was sold by auction for &pound;600 to Alec Roberton and took to the water\
  \ in the 1970s after some renovation and motorisation by Alec helped by a group\
  \ of enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1990s she was taken ashore at Dulas\
  \ Bay, suffered slight hull damage, recovered, and was taken to a caravan park where\
  \ she was put on display. When the caravan park was sold she could have been burnt\
  \ but the Amlwch Heritage Trust secured her future, transferring her to Amlwch and\
  \ then to Cemaes in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006 a new team and &pound;2,500 from\
  \ a Wales Co-op grant, found much rotten wood and moved her to Bethel to be placed\
  \ under cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once more funds were raised, in 2007 she was awarded\
  \ a Heritage Lottery Grant with the restoration completed by Classic Sailboats in\
  \ 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2009 Charles Henry Ashley returned to Cemaes and\
  \ is moored in the harbour.</p>"
