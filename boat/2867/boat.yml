full_description: "The first\_of a new class of Norfolk One-Designs - a \xA365 racing\
  \ dinghy - was built in 1931 by Mr Herbert Woods of Potter Heigham as a protest\
  \ against the price of the 14ft International Class which was soaring to 150 guineas.\
  \  'The boats soon proved their worth, although they quickley attracted the attention\
  \ not only of young people but also of crack helmsmen, which, while disheartening\
  \ to the new hands, set a high standard of sailing which the younger school were\
  \ able to emulate.\_ Proof of their growing popularity was the commission of six\
  \ or seven new Norfolks each year unitl the commencement of war, and they continued\
  \ to be made at this rate from 1947 until 1951, with ten new ones in 1949.  In fact,\
  \ numbers of new boats wer lessening, for from 1951 until 1968 only nine more were\
  \ built.\_ The last was number 86 in 1968.\_ Tes Chamberlin picked out three young\
  \ helsmen who were already proving their ability in 1951, in spite of their youth.\_\
  \ The three young helmsmen were Ian Mackintosh, Martin Broom and Raymond Jeckells,\
  \ all of who are still sailing the identical boats they did all those years ago.\_\
  \ Ted Chamberlin commented \"It is a great credit to the builders of these boats\
  \ that Ian Mackintosh is getting winning guns in a boat that was built several years\
  \ before he was born, which just goes to prove what a high standard of craftsmanship\
  \ there is in the Norfolk boatyards.\"  One change, however, has been forced upon\
  \ the class since the war, and this was the replacement of bamboo with hollowed\
  \ spruce for spars and masts, due to the impossibility of obtaining suitable bamboo.\_\
  \ But there is still a few bamboo masts to be seen, as well as plenty of gaffs and\
  \ booms.\_ The boats were built of African mahogany, clench built, copper fastened,\
  \ with gunter rig, no spinnaker being allowed, and even no forestay or battens.\
  \  The \"B\" on the sail rather than \"N\" for Norfolks is confusing until one remembers\
  \ that the 12 foot Nationals, which were sailed frequently on these waters inter-war,\
  \ display the letter \"N\".\_ Therefore \"B\" for Broads was chosen."
