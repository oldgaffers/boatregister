  Tiernan Roe build completed July ‘23. Sea trials and getting to know her sailing
  idiosyncrasies to follow… Tiernan has done a fabulous job building this Ilur and
  very much looking forward to realising the potential in the boat. I believe the
  Ilur to be ideal for dinghy cruising on inshore Irish waters.
