short_description: <p>Annelis is a 40ft, ferrocement, gaff ketch. She was originally
  built and fitted out over a period of 12 years, spanning the 1980s. Her lines are
  based on a Falmouth pilot cutter, and she is rigged traditionally, with wooden spars
  and heavy sails. In 2013 young gaffers Josh Masters and Sam Doman began an extensive
  rebuild.</p>
full_description: "<p>Since 2000, &#39;Annelis&#39; has been owned and sailed by the\
  \ Masters family, primarily in the Mediterranean. However, she has spent the past\
  \ few years out of the water, in a boatyard, in Suffolk. Unfortunately showing her\
  \ age, and no longer seaworthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, young gaffers Josh Masters\
  \ and Sam Doman took on the project to return her to a seaworthy condition. They\
  \ will have to remove all of the old steel and concrete ballast, and replace it\
  \ with fresh steel and polyester resin (after making necessary repairs to the skin\
  \ of the hull). They plan to re-make all of the spars: two new masts, two booms,\
  \ a gaff, a topmast, and a bowsprit! Once the hull is sound, and re-ballasted, and\
  \ the new spars made, they will replace all the rigging, and re-fit the interior.\
  \ There are other, less major things to do along the way, such as over-hauling the\
  \ engine (a marinised Landrover engine), repairing and re-sheathing the decks, reconditioning\
  \ the paraffin stove and rebuilding the cockpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Josh has recently\
  \ finished his A-Levels, is an experienced sailor, and a capable engineer working\
  \ in the marine industry. Sam is qualified and works as a traditional boatbuilder,\
  \ and has sailed all over the globe. Between them, they have the skills necessary\
  \ to get &#39;Annelis&#39; back in the water, and sail her, aiming to take her across\
  \ the Atlantic, to Central America. From here, they plan on continuing down the\
  \ East coast of South America, around to Patagonia, and eventually around the world!</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>2016 sees great progress with the hull completely intact again, ballast,\
  \ engine and water tanks in and work underway with fitting out, on track for launching\
  \ in the summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ketch-annelis.tumblr.com/\" target=\"\
