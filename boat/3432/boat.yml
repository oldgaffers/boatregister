  According to Uffa Fox "Crystal is one of the best, if not the best, cruiser of
  her size and type ever designed."

  Although built in Scotland by Dickies of Tarbert her first owner immediately
  moved her to Rochester, where she stayed until 1933 when she was sold and taken
  to Burnham-on-Crouch. Her new owner added a doghouse, and reduced the length of
  her bowsprit, but he was obviously pleased with her as he replaced her original
  W.D.Fair petrol engine with a new Stuart Turner in 1948 and kept her until 1954.


  Her next owner Edwin Ker sailed Crystal single handed back to Scotland via the
  Forth and Clyde Canal and kept her first at Rothesay, then Tighnabruich, and
  latterly at Oban. He sailed her for long periods each summer from 1957 to the
  mid 1970s, going as far north as Stornaway, and habitually sailed round Kintyre
  rather than through the Crinan Canal. He preferred not to use the engine and in
  early days he often sailed alone, but latterly with various crew, either friends
  or undergraduated found for him by various means. One regular source of crew was
  his friend Sir Charles Evans, principal of University College of North Wales,
  Bangor. Crystal was also lent out to friends from the UK and Vancouver where her
  owner had spent time between the wars.


  Crystal was based for most of this time at Jimmy Smith's Yard at Tighnabruich,
  but after the yard closed in the mid 1970s Crystal was moved to Oban, where she
  had a mooring on the Brandy Stone moorings in the Sound of Kerrera. Edwin was in
  his 80s at this point and Crystal's standard of maintenance declined with some
  of her equipment (including her stay sail) being lost or stolen. Latterly
  Crystal was only rigged briefly each summer so friends and family could use her.


  After Edwin Ker's death in 1980 Crystal was sold to two of her old "student"
  crew, and she moved to South Shian, Argyll. Her Stuart Turner engine was
  replaced by a Yanmar in 1994, and her original, and now leaking, teak decks were
  replaced with glassed ply.


  Eventually maintaining a wooden boat proved too much, and Crystal was sold
  again. She was brought back to Essex on a road trailer and underwent
  a renovation which may have seen her with a new mast and certainly saw
  the removal of her 1930's doghouse. After sailing her for a few years she was
  put up for sale in 2002.


  Her next owner seems to have got a lot of use out of her, but we have no
  reliable information about this stage in her life and she passed into the
  ownership of Ivan Maskell who spent many years restoring her once again. He
  unfortunately died before finishing the work but enough had been done to show
  what a superb yacht she was, and the work was completed by a new owner in 2018,
  and she is now being sailed out of Bembridge IOW.


  Although initally a "one off" design, Crystal II now has a sister ship,
  Daydream, constructed using traditional methods in America in 2016.
