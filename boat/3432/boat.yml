  According to Uffa Fox "Crystal is one of the best, if not the best, cruiser of
  her size and type ever designed."

full_description: "Although built in Scotland by Dickies of Tarbert her first owner\
  \ immediately\nmoved\_her to\_Rochester, where she stayed until 1933\_when she was\
  \ sold and taken\nto\_Burnham-on-Crouch. Her new owner added a doghouse, and reduced\_\
  the length of\nher bowsprit, but he was obviously pleased with her as he replaced\
  \ her original\nW.D.Fair petrol engine with a new Stuart Turner in 1948 and\_kept\
  \ her until 1954.\n\n\nHer next\_owner Edwin Ker sailed Crystal single handed back\
  \ to Scotland via the\nForth and Clyde Canal\_and kept her first at Rothesay, then\
  \ Tighnabruich, and\nlatterly at Oban. He sailed her for long periods each summer\
  \ from 1957 to the\nmid 1970s, going\_as far north as Stornaway, and habitually\_\
  sailed\_round Kintyre\nrather than through the Crinan Canal. He\_preferred not to\
  \ use the engine and\_in\nearly days he often sailed alone, but latterly with various\
  \ crew, either friends\nor undergraduated found for him by various means. One regular\
  \ source of crew was\nhis friend Sir Charles Evans, principal of University College\
  \ of North Wales,\nBangor. Crystal was also lent out to friends from the UK and\
  \ Vancouver where her\nowner\_had spent time between the wars.\n\n\nCrystal was\
  \ based for most of this time at Jimmy Smith's Yard at Tighnabruich,\nbut after\
  \ the yard closed in the mid 1970s Crystal was moved to Oban, where she\nhad a mooring\
  \ on the Brandy Stone moorings in the Sound of Kerrera. Edwin was in\nhis 80s at\
  \ this point and Crystal's standard of maintenance declined with some\nof her equipment\
  \ (including her stay sail) being lost or stolen. Latterly\nCrystal was only rigged\
  \ briefly each summer so friends and family could use her.\n\n\nAfter Edwin Ker's\
  \ death in 1980 Crystal was sold to two\_of her old \"student\"\ncrew, and she moved\
  \ to South Shian, Argyll. Her Stuart\_Turner engine was\nreplaced by a Yanmar in\_\
  1994, and her original, and now leaking, teak decks were\nreplaced with glassed\
  \ ply.\n\n\nEventually maintaining a wooden boat proved too much, and Crystal was\
  \ sold\nagain. She was brought\_back to Essex on a road trailer and underwent\n\
  a\_renovation which may have seen her with a new mast and certainly saw\nthe\_removal\
  \ of\_her 1930's doghouse. After sailing her for a few years she was\nput up for\
  \ sale in 2002.\n\n\nHer next owner seems to have got a lot of\_use out of her,\
  \ but we have no\nreliable information about this stage in her life and she passed\
  \ into the\nownership of\_Ivan Maskell who\_spent many years restoring her once\
  \ again.\_He\nunfortunately died before finishing the work but enough had been done\
  \ to show\nwhat a superb yacht she was, and the work was completed by a new owner\
  \ in 2018,\nand she is now being sailed out of Bembridge IOW.\n\n\nAlthough initally\
  \ a \"one off\" design, Crystal II now has a sister ship,\nDaydream, constructed\
  \ using traditional methods in America in 2016.\n\n"
