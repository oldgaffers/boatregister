short_description: <p>According to Uffa Fox &quot;Crystal is one of the best, if not
  the best, cruiser of her size and type ever designed.&quot;</p>
full_description: "<p>Although built in Scotland by Dickies of Tarbert her first owner\
  \ immediately moved&nbsp;her to&nbsp;Rochester, where she stayed until 1933&nbsp;when\
  \ she was sold and taken to&nbsp;Burnham-on-Crouch. Her new owner added a doghouse,\
  \ and reduced&nbsp;the length of her bowsprit, but he was obviously pleased with\
  \ her as he replaced her original W.D.Fair petrol engine with a new Stuart Turner\
  \ in 1948 and&nbsp;kept her until 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her next&nbsp;owner Edwin\
  \ Ker sailed Crystal single handed back to Scotland via the Forth and Clyde Canal&nbsp;and\
  \ kept her first at Rothesay, then Tighnabruich, and latterly at Oban. He sailed\
  \ her for long periods each summer from 1957 to the mid 1970s, going&nbsp;as far\
  \ north as Stornaway, and habitually&nbsp;sailed&nbsp;round Kintyre rather than\
  \ through the Crinan Canal. He&nbsp;preferred not to use the engine and&nbsp;in\
  \ early days he often sailed alone, but latterly with various crew, either friends\
  \ or undergraduated found for him by various means. One regular source of crew was\
  \ his friend Sir Charles Evans, principal of University College of North Wales,\
  \ Bangor. Crystal was also lent out to friends from the UK and Vancouver where her\
  \ owner&nbsp;had spent time between the wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crystal was based for\
  \ most of this time at Jimmy Smith&#39;s Yard at Tighnabruich, but after the yard\
  \ closed in the mid 1970s Crystal was moved to Oban, where she had a mooring on\
  \ the Brandy Stone moorings in the Sound of Kerrera. Edwin was in his 80s at this\
  \ point and Crystal&#39;s standard of maintenance declined with some of her equipment\
  \ (including her stay sail) being lost or stolen. Latterly Crystal was only rigged\
  \ briefly each summer so friends and family could use her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Edwin\
  \ Ker&#39;s death in 1980 Crystal was sold to two&nbsp;of her old &quot;student&quot;\
  \ crew, and she moved to South Shian, Argyll. Her Stuart&nbsp;Turner engine was\
  \ replaced by a Yanmar in&nbsp;1994, and her original, and now leaking, teak decks\
  \ were replaced with glassed ply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually maintaining a wooden\
  \ boat proved too much, and Crystal was sold again. She was brought&nbsp;back to\
  \ Essex on a road trailer and underwent a&nbsp;renovation which may have seen her\
  \ with a new mast and certainly saw the&nbsp;removal of&nbsp;her 1930&#39;s doghouse.\
  \ After sailing her for a few years she was put up for sale in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>Her next owner seems to have got a lot of&nbsp;use out of her, but we have no\
  \ reliable information about this stage in her life and she passed into the ownership\
  \ of&nbsp;Ivan Maskell who&nbsp;spent many years restoring her once again.&nbsp;He\
  \ unfortunately died before finishing the work but enough had been done to show\
  \ what a superb yacht she was, and the work was completed by a new owner in 2018,\
  \ and she is now being sailed out of Bembridge IOW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although initally\
  \ a &quot;one off&quot; design, Crystal II now has a sister ship, Daydream, constructed\
  \ using traditional methods in America in 2016.</p>"
