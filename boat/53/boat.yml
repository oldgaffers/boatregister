  Lloyds Yacht Register from 1886 to 1965. Mentioned in Wherries & Waterways by R
  Maltster. She was built for Dr W A S Wynne of St Olave's Priory, Herringfleet,
  Gt Yarmouth. In her first season, Wynne entertained G L Watson himself on board
  at Oulton Broad Regatta. His log books and those of the second owner Aubrey
  Blake are extant and detail her life from the lofting of her lines in 1885 up to
  1893. Further details of her adventures while kept at Pin Mill in the early
  1930s in the ownership of Bill and Kitty Collett are also described, including a
  terrifying collision with a steamer on a pitch dark night below Pin Mill where
  injury and sinking were narrowly avoided. She later came to be based on the
  River Blackwater and took part in OGA races in the late 1960s/early 70s. while
  owned by Pat Barber. Bought by Jamie Clay in 1989 and kept well shored and
  covered pending rebuild.
