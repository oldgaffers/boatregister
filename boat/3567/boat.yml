full_description: |-
  Agnes Jayne is a fine example of a Gaffers & Luggers Clovelly Picarooner, built
  by Martin Heard of Tregatreath Yacht Yard in Mylor, near Falmouth, Cornwall. The
  Picarooner is a sturdy and well-built seaworthy 16’ gaff rig sailing dayboat,
  based on the old wooden fishing boats that sailed out of Clovelly to fish for
  the local ‘silver darlings’ or herring. The original mould was taken from one of
  these old lug-rigged sailing boats, and the rig converted to the more popular
  gaff rig and steel centreplate, for this GRP version. 


  She was brought from the West Country to Waldringfield on the River Deben and
  lives off the Maybush Pub. Her range is normally to one of the four other pubs
  on the River Deben for which there is convenient landing. I am grateful to the
  ECOGA who have inspired me and especially the husband of ECOGA Minutes Secretary
  who has helped maintain ‘Agnes Jayne’, mending broken gaff jaws, replacing a
  broken bowsprit and making a new tiller.
