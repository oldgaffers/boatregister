  Turtle. I originally tried to purchase Turtle in 1986 but my offer was rejected,
  in 2002 I came across her laying a wreck at Leigh on sea and bought her for £30.
  Due to her construction with vertical iron nails there was no option but to
  sheath her in GRP which has proved a great success, 2007 new decks, 2018 new
  sails by James Lawrence, 2020 new bulkhead and “yachty” refit. Turtle was
  rumoured to have been built in North America as a farm or smallholding boat and
  was obviously designed to carry weight, eg sheep, pigs or hay etc . Cheaply
  built and not expected to last more than a few years. Locals say she was shipped
  to Tilbury dock on a Liberty ship just after WW2. She was owned in the 50s & 60s
  by the Leigh on Sea marine artist Vic Ellis and was moored by the Essex Yacht
  Club. She has now been saved for many years of happy sailing.
