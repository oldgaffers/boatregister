full_description: "Turtle. I originally tried to purchase Turtle in 1986 but my offer\
  \ was rejected, in 2002 I came across her laying a wreck at Leigh on sea and bought\
  \ her for \xA330\\. Due to her construction with vertical iron nails there was no\
  \ option but to sheath her in GRP which has proved a great success, 2007 new decks,\
  \ 2018 new sails by James Lawrence, 2020 new bulkhead and \u201Cyachty\u201D refit.\
  \ Turtle was rumoured to have been built in North America as a farm or smallholding\
  \ boat and was obviously designed to carry weight, eg sheep, pigs or hay etc . Cheaply\
  \ built and not expected to last more than a few years. Locals say she was shipped\
  \ to Tilbury dock on a Liberty ship just after WW2\\. She was owned in the 50s &\
  \ 60s by the Leigh on Sea marine artist Vic Ellis and was moored by the Essex Yacht\
  \ Club. She has now been saved for many years of happy sailing."
