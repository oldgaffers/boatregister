short_description: <p><em>Mari</em> is a classic Hillyard yacht built in LIttlehampton</p>
full_description: '<p>Mari was built in Littlehampton 1924, &nbsp;and remained based
  there until 1961 when she moved to Weymouth. Unlike many Hillyards she was never
  converted to a Bermudan rig. In 1973 her owner moved her to Burnham on Sea where
  her original petrol engine was replaced by a diesel in 1976. She &nbsp;remained
  in Burnham until at least 1980. She was placed on the OGA register in 1999 by her
  owner at the time, who kept her at Chichester, but when he sold her in 2008 she
  went to Wales.</p>

  <p>She lay abandoned in a boat yard there until 2018, when she was bought with the
  intention of turning her into a "Glamping Pod". This did not happen, and her current
  owners bought her in late 2020.</p>

  <p>She is currently undergoing a comprehensive restoration.</p>'
