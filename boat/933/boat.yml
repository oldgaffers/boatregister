  of the planking, tiller, mast and boom remain.
full_description: "<p>Kestrel is believed to have been built in 1891 by John White\
  \ of Cowes as a yacht. Her dimensions would have allowed her to have raced in the\
  \ 25ft waterline class popular in the 1880s or perhaps in the 2.5 rating class popular\
  \ in the 1890&#39;s. Her Lloyds registration certificate dates back to 1917 and\
  \ Lloyds registers of Yachts include a Kestrel of very similar dimensions back to\
  \ 1904, always being based on the East Coast. Any earlier history is unknown.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Past owners include the nautical authors George Arnott, Harvey Benham and\
  \ Richard Woodman. Kestrel reached her 100th year in a rather sorry state of repair.\
  \ By the 1960s she was leaking badly and in an effort to preserve her she was sheathed\
  \ in glass fibre. This enabled her to continue sailing until 1991 when she was deemed\
  \ too&nbsp;unsound to continue afloat. Her engine was Coventry Victor, Petrol, 3.5\
  \ of 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchased by James Palmer for &pound;1 in 1997 she was\
  \ largely rebuilt over the next four years. Kestrel is constructed of teak planking\
  \ on oak timbers. Originally built without a ballast keel, a ton of lead was bolted\
  \ to the original elm keel prior to 1930 along with various lead infills presumably\
  \ to improve her stability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She now has an opepe keel supporting the\
  \ same lead ballast. The deck was replaced and constructed of Russian deal on plywood,\
  \ the lay of the deck being similar to that removed and typical of the period. Of\
  \ the original boat only two thirds of the planking, tiller, mast and boom remain.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Kestrel&#39;s current rig (2013) is around 620 square ft. Enlarged slightly\
  \ from the 1991 rig it is still somewhat smaller than the 800 square ft listed in\
  \ 1904. Kestrel took part in the first East Coast Old Gaffers Race in 1963 and the\
  \ 2013 OGA Jubilee Celebrations in Cowes and East Coast Race.</p>"
