short_description: |-
  *Undine* was built 1889 at Menai Straits, by G Edwards to the design of the
  original owner J.H. Cousins. Typical of her time, she was a 'plank on edge' gaff
  cutter, with clipper bow, narrow beam and heavy lead keel to keep her upright.
  Her original length on deck was 33', increased to 35' by the addition of 2' to
  her counter.

  *Undine* was originally kept at Caernarfon by her first owned J.H.Cousins. She
  remained in the Mersey area until 1905, when she changed hands and moved to
  Burnham-on-Crouch. The following year she was sold to Army captains stationed at
  Fort Albert in Alderney, and was kept in Braye Harbour for three years. She then
  spent three further years in Portsmouth until 1912 until being bought by two new
  owners who kept her at Burnham. In 1914 she was sold to John A. Denny and during
  the first world war her lead keel was removed to make bullets.


  Between the wars *Undine* lay on the shore at West Mersea, used as a houseboat,
  with windows cut into her topsides and a henhouse on deck. It was in this sorry
  state that two young engineers from Ipswich found her and decided to get her
  sailing again. They bought her for Â£12, had her towed to the Orwell Yacht Club
  at Ipswich, then spent several years rebuilding her, interrupted for a while by
  the second world war.


  They replaced the lost lead keel with a cast iron one, rebuilt the decks,
  superstructure, interior and did major repairs to the hull. They replaced the
  gaff rig with a Bermudan; the fashion of the day. They gave her a very tall
  heavy mast that had already seen service in a big fishing smack. They retained
  the bowsprit and cutter rig providing a total sail area of 580 sq. ft.


  After the war *Undine* was seen sailing once more after 20 years out of
  commission. She made a fine sight in the local club races out of the Orwell and
  was known for her habit of 'laying over' in a breeze.


  In 1956 she was sold to A.W.F. Hunt and K Cocksedge, who continued to keep her
  at Ipswich, using her for family cruising. They sold her in 1962 to the rather
  improbably sounding Polish Yacht Club of Great Britain, and she was kept in
  Gravesend and Walton.


  In 1967 Nick and Chris Temple found her in a mud berth opposite the Walton and
  Frinton Yacht Club in a fairly derelict state and decided to take her over and
  put her back in commission. They had often seen her sailing on the Stour when
  she was under the ownership of Ken Cocksedge, and had always thought her to be a
  beautiful boat.


  They took her round to Wrabness and had her on the beach for several weeks
  before getting her sailing later in the season. They kept her at Wrabness and
  greatly enjoyed the attention she received around the local rivers. Longshoremen
  in dinghies would drop their oars and gaze in disbelief, muttering "Well, if 'at
  in't the old Un-dine. I never knew she war still afloot."


  In 1971 she was given a major refit, which involved building a cradle and
  slipway on the beach at Wrabness to haul her above the high water mark. The
  Bermudan mast was condemned because of extensive rot and they decided to change
  back to gaff rig whilst they were about it. A reasonably straight larch tree was
  found at a local timber yard, rescued in the nick of time from being turned into
  larch lap fencing. It was shaped into a quite presentable pole mast in a few
  days, and the boom was lenghtened by 2'. The spreaders and the lower standing
  rigging from the Bermudan rig were re-used to save making up a new set. A gaff
  mainsail from a pre-war Broards cruiser was convenietly to hand and re-cut to
  fit the new rig with a good coat of tan dressing.


  The new rig was delightfully simple and very much lighter than the complicated
  Bermudan/Marconi set up with diamond stays, jumper struts and a standing
  backstay. The sail area was kept to 580 sq.ft. and 60 sq. ft. of this was in the
  form of a jib headed topsail. The mast was 10' shorter so there was less weight
  aloft despite the addition of a 15/ larch gaff.


  *Undine* performed better under her original rig, heeling less, and pointing
  just as high with added speed off the wind. Admittedly the long boom could touch
  the water on a reach in brisk weather with a sea running, but generally the boat
  became much easier to manage, and was very snug with a couple of reefs tied down
  and the jib taken off. The further advantage was *Undine* was now eligible to
  join in the East Coast Gaffers events and she took part in 1971 and 1972 races.
  Chris and Nick offended some of the more sober members by showing off Undine's
  windward performance in luffing matches, something quite unheard of in those
  days.


  *Undine* cruised to the Solent in 1971 and Chris spent that winter living aboard
  whilst moored on the Itchen. The Tortoise stove in the saloon was very highly
  valued during those months.


  In the autumn of 1982 Chris and Nick very reluctantly decided to sell *Undine*
  because of other committments. She went to Bristol where she lay at Pill. The
  new owner remedied a certain looseness of the counter by putting a saw through
  it about 2' from the stern.


  Moving on a few years, *Undine* had been lying at Downs Road Boatyard, Maldon,
  Essex and the yard wanted to dispose of her so Nick Temple bought her back in
  2018 and is moving her to his mill in Suffolk.


  Unfortunately she then "went up in smoke" and is no more. Reported 2025
