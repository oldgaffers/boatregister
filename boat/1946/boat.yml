    Kittiwake II was built for me in 1988. She was the first boat built commercially
    by Roger Wilkinson of Kittiwake Boats, Macclesfield.   Her ‘clinker-look’ lines,
    and the wealth of mahogany and iroko trim, together with the sail configuration,
    give Kittiwakes a truly traditional look and draws much admiration wherever we
    go.


    Kittiwake II is a gaff-rigged yawl of 14' 3" on deck, 21' LOA and 14' LWL with a
    beam of 5'.  Draft is 9" with the centreplate up and 3' with the plate down.


    The green and white hull is sturdy GRP and originally had built in buoyancy fore
    and aft.  Subsequently Roger added built in buoyancy for me beneath the side
    benches incorporating two very useful lockers each side.  He also fitted a new
    mast with tabernacle.


    Included with the boat are a Snipe road trailer with winch and rear light board;
    heavy duty boat cover; two rudders – one fixed plate and one drop plate; a pair
    of oars with rowlocks; a Yamaha Malta outboard; separate fuel tank; manual bilge
    pump; anchor and line; mooring lines.


    Kittiwake II has always been meticulously maintained; thoroughly washed down in
    fresh water after each use and kept in a garage when not on the water. 


    She has been trailed around England, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany, and sailed
    on rivers, lakes and sea.  She’s crept up creeks and estuaries with the
    centreplate up, pulled up on sandy beaches for picnics and won the Fowey
    Classics two years running.


    An excellent family boat providing endless hours of fun for us, our children and
    grandchildren, but now sadly needs a new home.
