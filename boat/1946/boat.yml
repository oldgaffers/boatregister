  sales_text: "Kittiwake II was built in 1988. She was the first boat built commercially
    by\nRoger Wilkinson of Kittiwake Boats, Macclesfield.   Her ‘clinker-look’ lines,\n
    and the wealth of mahogany and iroko trim, together with the sail configuration,\n
    give Kittiwakes a truly traditional look and draws much admiration wherever we\n
    go.\n\n\nKittiwake II is a gaff-rigged yawl of 14' 3\" on deck, 21' LOA and 14'
    LWL with a\nbeam of 5'.  Draft is 9\" with the centreplate up and 3' with the
    plate down.\n\n\nThe green and white hull is sturdy GRP and originally had built
    in buoyancy fore\nand aft.  Subsequently Roger added built in buoyancy for me
    beneath the side\nbenches incorporating two very useful lockers each side.  He
    also fitted a new\nmast with tabernacle.\n\n\nIncluded with the boat are a Snipe
    road trailer with winch and rear light board;\nheavy duty boat cover; two rudders
    – one fixed plate and one drop plate; a pair\nof oars with rowlocks; a Yamaha
    Malta outboard; separate fuel tank; manual bilge\npump; anchor and line; mooring
    lines.\n\n\nKittiwake II has always been meticulously maintained; thoroughly washed
    down in\nfresh water after each use and kept in a garage when not on the water. \n
    \n\nShe has been trailed around England, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany, and sailed\n
    on rivers, lakes and sea.  She’s crept up creeks and estuaries with the\ncentreplate
    up, pulled up on sandy beaches for picnics and won the Fowey\nClassics two years
    running.\n\n\nAn excellent family boat providing endless hours of fun for us,
    our children and\ngrandchildren, but now sadly needs a new home."
