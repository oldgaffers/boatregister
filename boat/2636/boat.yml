full_description: "From NMMC: &ldquot;This RNSA (Royal Naval Sailing Association)\
  \ type of sailing dinghy was a modified version of the 14 ft One-Design Island Class,\
  \ designed by Charles Nicholson and Uffa Fox in 1935.<p>In 1937 the Admiralty adopted\
  \ the class, with some modifications, specifically to adapt it for use aboard the\
  \ Navy\u2019s warships. Its purpose was to provide the crew with an opportunity\
  \ to go sailing in boats other than the heavy service cutters and whalers. The gunter\
  \ rig allowed the mast and sails to be stowed within the length of the hull itself,\
  \ saving space aboard ship. Its heavy and sturdy clinker construction made it ideal\
  \ for launching off a beach.&rdquot;<p>Samfire was restored by Andrew Matchett around\
  \ 2003/2004. When he got her she had an improvised rig on a GP14 mast. He was looking\
  \ into restoring her original gunter rig design but also looked at the Uffa Fox\
  \ Bermudan racing rig with 25' mast and 10' boom."
