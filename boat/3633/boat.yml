full_description: |-
  The 11 foot long Scow originated in the 1920s as a sailing tender for larger
  cruising yachts, but over the years, has become popular as a single-handed
  sheltered water racing dinghy. The rig is a single balanced lug, with the mast
  and spars designed to fit within the length of the boat. There are many slight
  variations of the basic design in the Solent area and beyond, with the Avon Scow
  being the standard Scow dinghy in use at the Christchurch Sailing Club.
