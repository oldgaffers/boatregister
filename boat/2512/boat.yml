full_description: "<p>&#39;Kan an Mor&#39; is a Falmouth workboat built as an open\
  \ boat 1979-82. She was registered as FH73 and originally called &#39;Heritage of\
  \ Mylor&#39;. She was found to be too big and was later registered for trawling\
  \ and angling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has been rebuilt from the bare hull with 11 rotting\
  \ planks since 1998; a little done every week by her owner! She has been fitted\
  \ out for long distance short-handed cruising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was re-registered\
  \ when relaunched in 2000 with her present name &#39;Kan an Mor&#39; which is &#39;Song\
  \ of the Sea&#39; in Cornish.</p>"
