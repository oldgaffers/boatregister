  sales_text: <p>This is your chance to acquire a great family boat. A gaff cutter
    with a large self-draining cockpit for all the family plus a two berth cabin for
    the odd night away. Designed and built by Malcolm Goodwin, originally for his
    own family, Sara is No. 2 in the mini fleet of three. The plywood hull is treated
    with Wests throughout. It has a steel centreplate and is fun to sail. More like
    a big dinghy than a cabin cruiser! The full gaff-cutter rig, with topsail, provides
    endless fun. Now ashore at Brightlingsea for the winter.</p>
