full_description: |-
  Built in 1906, she was found, serving as a houseboat, in the early 1970s by John
  Rigby and an almost complete rebuild was carried out by John Milgate, assisted
  by Graham Elcock at Peldon.


  Unfortunately, she was lost to the sands of the estuary shortly into her new
  career. As a result, her garboards were sprung and a considerable amount of work
  was required to return her to sailing condition. She was subsequently bought by
  Souter Harris who campaigned her locally and around the south and east coast
  with some success until 1999/2000 when James Bardrick took up ownership.


  She has been sailed hard over this period and certain parts of her structure
  were in need of attention in order for her to carry on to her 100th birthday.
  James has undertaken the mammoth task of restoring her centre line, deck and
  deckshelf and powerplants, both mechanical and windpowered, to their former
  glory.
