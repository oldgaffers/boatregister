short_description: <p>Originally built at Brightlingsea in 1906 she was rebuilt 2001
  - 2009 at Tollesbury, by Paul Drake.</p>
full_description: "<p>Built in 1906, she was found, serving as a houseboat, in the\
  \ early 1970s by John Rigby and an almost complete rebuild was carried out by John\
  \ Milgate, assisted by Graham Elcock at Peldon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, she\
  \ was lost to the sands of the estuary shortly into her new career. As a result,\
  \ her garboards were sprung and a considerable amount of work was required to return\
  \ her to sailing condition. She was subsequently bought by Souter Harris who campaigned\
  \ her locally and around the south and east coast with some success until 1999/2000\
  \ when James Bardrick took up ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has been sailed hard\
  \ over this period and certain parts of her structure were in need of attention\
  \ in order for her to carry on to her 100th birthday. James has undertaken the mammoth\
  \ task of restoring her centre line, deck and deckshelf and powerplants, both mechanical\
  \ and windpowered, to their former glory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/colmolaoi/with/14394546619\"\
