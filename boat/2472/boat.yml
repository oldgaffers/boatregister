full_description: |-
  'Excelsior' was built in Lowestoft, Suffolk, 1921and started work as a smack
  before being sold and taken to Norway. In 1971, John Wylson brought her back to
  Lowestoft with the intention of undertaking a full restoration to her original
  sailing appearance.


  By 1988 the restoration was complete and she was commissioned by HRH the
  Princess Royal as a sail training ship. Ten years later she started to trawl
  again under skipper Stuart White and in 1999 was entered into the National
  Register of Historic Vessels.
