  \ started work as a smack before being sold and taken to Norway. In 1971, John Wylson\
  \ brought her back to Lowestoft with the intention of undertaking a full restoration\
  \ to her original sailing appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1988 the restoration was\
  \ complete and she was commissioned by HRH the Princess Royal as a sail training\
  \ ship. Ten years later she started to trawl again under skipper Stuart White and\
  \ in 1999 was entered into the National Register of Historic Vessels.</p>"
