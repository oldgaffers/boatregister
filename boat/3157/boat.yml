  Built in 1930 by Harry Feltham, 'Random' is a one-off, originally Bermudan
  rigged. In 2011 she was converted to gaff rig. Sadly, she suffered in a fire in
  2016. She was bought by an enthusiast despite the insurance company writing her
  off, and she sails again from her home port in Brightlingsea.
full_description: |-
  'Random' was 'found' on Eel Pie Island, 1990, in a very sorry state.


  Considerable work was carried out including 90 new frames, 14 full length
  planks, over 4000 copper fastenings, new deck and beams, new cabinsides, new
  cockpit and combings, new engine and much more.


  Since her rebuild she cruised extensively and was ery active with the OGA on the
  East Coast, converting to gaff rig in 2011.


  Sadly, in 2016, she was declared a total loss following a fire at the yard where
  she was kept.Â 


  She was bought by an enthusiast despite the insurance company writing her off,
  and she sails again from her home port in Brightlingsea.
