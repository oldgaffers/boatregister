  cruiser/racing yacht.
full_description: "Abandoned in 1990 in a field, with the lid chopped off, one of\
  \ three Panda 711s\nbuilt. Although balsa core sandwich construction, they were\
  \ built in a female\nmould. One is in the Clyde and another in N. Wales still with\
  \ their original\nrig, a huge Bermudan main with a tiny jib.\n\nMick Kneale was\
  \ given the remains of the hull, the top having been chopped off\nalong the sheerline\
  \ and a big hole where the keel had been removed. He has\nraised the the freeboard\
  \ to make it into a dayboat. The watertight raised floor\nis made of 9mm Robins\
  \ Elite ply, glassed over. \n\nShe is a gaff sloop rig with alloy spars and the\
  \ fixed keel has a 315 kg bulb drawing 2.15m."
