  Genesta II, previously known as Ching Ching, was originally built as a small
  cruiser/racing yacht.
full_description: |-
  Abandoned in 1990 in a field, with the lid chopped off, one of three Panda 711s
  built. Although balsa core sandwich construction, they were built in a female
  mould. One is in the Clyde and another in N. Wales still with their original
  rig, a huge Bermudan main with a tiny jib.

  Mick Kneale was given the remains of the hull, the top having been chopped off
  along the sheerline and a big hole where the keel had been removed. He has
  raised the the freeboard to make it into a dayboat. The watertight raised floor
  is made of 9mm Robins Elite ply, glassed over.

  She is a gaff sloop rig with alloy spars and the fixed keel has a 315 kg bulb
  drawing 2.oom.

    Gaff LOA 26’ Designed by: Nick Wyatt and Peter Whipp Built by Freedom Yachts
    Re-built by Mick Kneale. Abandoned in 1990 in a field, with the lid chopped off,
    one of three Panda 711s built. Although balsa core sandwich construction, they
    were built in a female mould. One is in the Clyde and another in N. Wales still
    with their original rig, a huge Bermudan main with a tiny jib.

    Mick Kneale was given the remains of the hull, the top having been chopped off
    along the sheerline and a big hole where the keel had been removed. He has
    raised the the freeboard to make it into a dayboat. The watertight raised floor
    is made of 9mm Robins Elite ply, glassed over. She is a gaff sloop rig with
    alloy spars and the fixed keel has a 315 kg bulb drawing 2.15m.

    Sails: Mainsail, Genoa, jib, staysail, 2 x asymmetric spinnakers plus a superb
    Parasail. Boat is a fully rigged dayboat with all lines, compass, anchor,
    fenders, sail covers etc. 6hp Tohatsu outboard (2 tanks), Novasail NS360+
    instrument, Banks winter boat cover and cradle.

    In local racing, we find it sails on average slightly quicker than a Bolero and
    slightly slower than a First Class 8. Photo albums of Genesta II and its rebuild
