short_description: Genesta II, previously known as Ching Ching, was originally built
  as a small cruiser/racing yacht.
full_description: "<p>Abandoned in 1990 in a field, with the lid chopped off, one\
  \ of four&nbsp;Panda&nbsp;711s&nbsp;built. Although sandwich construction, they\
  \ were built in a female mould. One is in the Clyde and another in N. Wales still\
  \ with their original rig, a huge Bermudan main with a tiny jib. Another was crushed\
  \ by a ship in Ramsey Harbour and was broken up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mick Kneale was given\
  \ the remains of the hull, the top having been chopped off along the sheerline and\
  \ a big hole where the keel had been removed. He has raised the the freeboard to\
  \ make it into a dayboat. The watertight raised floor is made of 9mm Robins Elite\
  \ ply, glassed over. She is a gaff&nbsp;sloop rig with alloy spars and daggerboard\
  \ has a 315 kg bulb drawing 2m.</p>"
