  cruiser/racing yacht.
full_description: |-
  Abandoned in 1990 in a field, with the lid chopped off, one of three Panda 711s
  built. Although balsa core sandwich construction, they were built in a female
  mould. One is in the Clyde and another in N. Wales still with their original
  rig, a huge Bermudan main with a tiny jib.


  Mick Kneale was given the remains of the hull, the top having been chopped off
  along the sheerline and a big hole where the keel had been removed. He has
  raised the the freeboard to make it into a dayboat. The watertight raised floor
  is made of 9mm Robins Elite ply, glassed over. She is a gaff sloop rig with
  alloy spars and the fixed keel has a 315 kg bulb drawing 2.15m.
