full_description: VIXEN (813) 17' half decker, Gunter rig with bowsprit.  In 1937
  Uffa Fox was commissioned to design a boat suitable for estuary and coastal sailing.  He
  produced Vixen, to be light in weight and easily handled for beaching.  Built in
  Dublin 1938, she made several long voyages being transported by steamer to the West
  Coast of Scotland and to Southampton.  Large storage area below foredeck for camping
  equipment & use of cockpit tent allows 2 people to sleep on board.  Hull & deck
  have been completely restored over 3 years using the West epoxy resin saturation
  technique and is now completely impervious to the ingress of water.  Galvanised
  steel centre plate operated by Chinese windlass.  Tanned cotton mainsail, roller
  reefing genoa & ghoster plus larger mainsail & light weight spars for use in light
  airs.  Light weight hull & style of rigging make this boat an ideal trailer sailer.
