full_description: |-
  Sometimes spelled *Gighia*, *Gigha* is a one-off Alfred Mylne designed
  centre-board sloop, design number 294. Owned first in the Clyde and then from
  1956 in Northumberland, home port in the 1970's was Amble. Took part in the NW
  area race in 1976.  Described in the 1976/3 log as a "Myne designed Scottish
  Island's class 26 footer", but this was a mistake as the Scottish Island class
  is larger and dates from 1929.


  Undergoing restoration in 2022. Transom replaced by 2023, with with work ongoing
  on the side decks and planking near the stern.
