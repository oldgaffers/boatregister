short_description: <p>Built in 1904, Dolphin of Leith has cruised extensively around
  the world. She is now based in New Zealand, having sailed there from the Solent,
  arriving February 2014.</p>
full_description: "<p>Cruised by J Lowrie and family to South Africa via West Africa
  and S America and back 1974 -75. Cruising in 1988 via South Atlantic Islands, Carribbean,
  Bermuda and Azores. &#39;Dolphin of Leith&#39; was built for W C Cranford and used
  as day sailer with engine installed in 1908. Her second owner, Victor Dawson, converted
  her to a cruiser. She was bought by John Davis in 1961 from her previous owner&#39;s
  estate. John Lowrie passed the boat on to son Iain who with his wife Vicki and their
  two young children sailed her to New Zealand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>March 2015: Auckland,

  in Gaffers Log, March 2012, just before the family departed for New Zealand.</h4>\r
  \n\r\n<p>Dolphin&rsquo;s first outing, after the major refit we completed before
  leaving to cruise to New Zealand, was to the Solent Old Gaffers Annual Race at the
  end of August last year. Famous now for being the year of &lsquo;The Squall&rsquo;,
  the race to Portsmouth showed us we had some significant stowage issues. In a nutshell,
  despite best efforts everything we owned ended up on the saloon floor en route.
  So it ended up being three weeks later and not the planned one that we finally sailed
  away, without much fanfare, from our home port of Marchwood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took
  a lot of hard work and some ingenious stowing but on 17th September we ventured
  out into the Solent bound for Lymington, and made it as far as Newport. A few days
  later we bade farewell to Iain&rsquo;s parents at Lymington, and headed west. It
  was only once we were through the Needles Channel on that flat-calm early morning
  that we really felt we were on our way and finally out of our back yard.</p>\r\n
  \r\n<p>Dolphin of Leith is a 1904 gaff cutter, built as a one-off on Scottish Fishing
  Boat lines. She&rsquo;s a mere 28ft, and we are her 5th owners. The previous owners
  were Iain&rsquo;s parents, who bought her in 1973 and cruised her to South Africa
  with Iain as a toddler and back again in 1988 with two teenage sons. So when we
  decided to emigrate to New Zealand after we took over the boat, there was really
  only one way to get her there. Sail. With our two children, Finn aged 27 months
  and Petra, aged 9 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So after a beautifully calm run to Weymouth,
  followed by a tumultuous crossing of Lyme Bay, we eventually crossed the Channel
  from Torquay to Trebuerden, and then slowly made our way round the North West corner
  of France via the Chenal du Four and the Raz du Sein to Audierne, where we waited
  for the weather window for Biscay. It finally came at the very end of October. It
  was not the easiest of crossings: the, er, &lsquo;highlight&rsquo; was bailing with
  a bucket out the forehatch after the forward bilge pump failed about 11pm on the
  first night because Vicki had helpfully left the plug out of the sink. Which won&rsquo;t
  happen a second time. The remainder of the crossing was a little less eventful,
  and we could finally enjoy some open ocean sailing in the sunshine.</p>\r\n\r\n
  <p>After 4 nights at sea we arrived in Gijon feeling much buoyed up by the experience
  and glad that possibly one of the hardest (certainly most anticipated) legs of the
  journey was over. Dolphin handled the crossing beautifully, as did the children
  - a lot better than we did! From Gijon we coast-hopped in legs of 2-3 days around
  Cabo Finisterre and down the Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal. More than once
  we had the pleasure of dolphins playing in Dolphin&rsquo;s bow wave, which brightens
  up any mood. We experienced a gale in the marina at Bayona, which sustained some
  damage to the topsides, but fortunately nothing so strong at sea (a mere F7 whilst
  bailing in Biscay!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon rounding Cabo Sao Vicente onto the Algarve
  at the beginning of December we experienced the joy of flat calm seas, brilliant
  sunshine and a broad reach. For about 2 hours. The final leg from Portimao on the
  Algarve to Gibraltar, where we are now, was perhaps the most eventful. It started
  with being becalmed in the late afternoon as we left, and just as night fell we
  got some wind, and at the same time saw what we assumed were 2 parachute flares
  off our port beam. We changed course accordingly and saw another vessel heading
  in a similar direction &ndash; only that vessel turned out to be the Portuguese
  Navy who then boarded us for an inspection. Which we passed with flying colours
  and were such good mates by the end of it that Iain had them sign the guest book.
  And we never did find out any more about the flares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast,
  night 2 of that passage saw us running at 4 knots under staysail only and getting
  seriously drenched from waves and rain whilst hand-steering&nbsp; through the Straits
  of Gibraltar in a system that we had not seen coming on any forecast we had looked
  at! Dolphin balances well on her sails&nbsp; when running or on the wind using basically
  a rolling hitch and a few well-placed shock cords, but when the wind is on the beam
  there&rsquo;s no option but to hang on to the tiller. Something we hope to rectify
  over the coming months. Thus it was a long night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We finally arrived
  in Gibraltar in time for family visits and Petra&rsquo;s first birthday, and have
  enjoyed Christmas and New Year celebrations here with new-found friends. All along
  the way we have been delighted to find that the cruising community is indeed like
  a village &ndash; people are so friendly and willing to help, or just have a chat
  over a drink. A lot like the Gaffers really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do however now know
  more people in this marina than we ever did on our street in London! From here,
  we are Africa-bound. We have run out of spaces and hidey-holes to store any more
  food or juice - we probably have enough to get us all the way to NZ - the rigging
  has all been checked and some more adjustments made, so it&rsquo;s time to move
  on. We plan a couple of short stays on the African mainland before heading to the
  Canaries, then Cape Verdes which is our planned jump-off point for the Atlantic,
  most likely now in early March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, well, we&rsquo;ll just
  have to see where the wind is blowing. We would both like to say a huge thank-you
  to all the Gaffers that supported and helped us during all the planning and preparation
  for this trip. Without a lot of the advice, expertise, general labour, beds, dinners
  and babysitting not to mention spare bits of kit and useful gifts from so many of
  them we suspect we would be planning on racing at Yogaff again this year rather
  than enjoying tropical sunshine. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those that are interested,
