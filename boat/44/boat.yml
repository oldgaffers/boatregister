  \ and S America and back 1974 -75. Cruising in 1988 via South Atlantic Islands,\
  \ Carribbean, Bermuda and Azores. &#39;Dolphin of Leith&#39; was built for W C Cranford\
  \ and used as day sailer with engine installed in 1908. Her second owner, Victor\
  \ Dawson, converted her to a cruiser. She was bought by John Davis in 1961 from\
  \ her previous owner&#39;s estate. John Lowrie passed the boat on to son Iain who\
  \ with his wife Vicki and their two young children sailed her to New Zealand.</p>\r\

  \n<h4>First published in Gaffers Log, March 2012, just before the family departed\
  \ for New Zealand.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Dolphin&rsquo;s first outing, after the major\
  \ refit we completed before leaving to cruise to New Zealand, was to the Solent\
  \ Old Gaffers Annual Race at the end of August last year. Famous now for being the\
  \ year of &lsquo;The Squall&rsquo;, the race to Portsmouth showed us we had some\
  \ significant stowage issues. In a nutshell, despite best efforts everything we\
  \ owned ended up on the saloon floor en route. So it ended up being three weeks\
  \ later and not the planned one that we finally sailed away, without much fanfare,\
  \ from our home port of Marchwood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took a lot of hard work and\
  \ some ingenious stowing but on 17th September we ventured out into the Solent bound\
  \ for Lymington, and made it as far as Newport. A few days later we bade farewell\
  \ to Iain&rsquo;s parents at Lymington, and headed west. It was only once we were\
  \ through the Needles Channel on that flat-calm early morning that we really felt\
  \ we were on our way and finally out of our back yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dolphin of\
  \ Leith is a 1904 gaff cutter, built as a one-off on Scottish Fishing Boat lines.\
  \ She&rsquo;s a mere 28ft, and we are her 5th owners. The previous owners were Iain&rsquo;s\
  \ parents, who bought her in 1973 and cruised her to South Africa with Iain as a\
  \ toddler and back again in 1988 with two teenage sons. So when we decided to emigrate\
  \ to New Zealand after we took over the boat, there was really only one way to get\
  \ her there. Sail. With our two children, Finn aged 27 months and Petra, aged 9\
  \ months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So after a beautifully calm run to Weymouth, followed by\
  \ a tumultuous crossing of Lyme Bay, we eventually crossed the Channel from Torquay\
  \ to Trebuerden, and then slowly made our way round the North West corner of France\
  \ via the Chenal du Four and the Raz du Sein to Audierne, where we waited for the\
  \ weather window for Biscay. It finally came at the very end of October. It was\
  \ not the easiest of crossings: the, er, &lsquo;highlight&rsquo; was bailing with\
  \ a bucket out the forehatch after the forward bilge pump failed about 11pm on the\
  \ first night because Vicki had helpfully left the plug out of the sink. Which won&rsquo;t\
  \ happen a second time. The remainder of the crossing was a little less eventful,\
  \ and we could finally enjoy some open ocean sailing in the sunshine.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>After 4 nights at sea we arrived in Gijon feeling much buoyed up by the experience\
  \ and glad that possibly one of the hardest (certainly most anticipated) legs of\
  \ the journey was over. Dolphin handled the crossing beautifully, as did the children\
  \ - a lot better than we did! From Gijon we coast-hopped in legs of 2-3 days around\
  \ Cabo Finisterre and down the Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal. More than once\
  \ we had the pleasure of dolphins playing in Dolphin&rsquo;s bow wave, which brightens\
  \ up any mood. We experienced a gale in the marina at Bayona, which sustained some\
  \ damage to the topsides, but fortunately nothing so strong at sea (a mere F7 whilst\
  \ bailing in Biscay!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon rounding Cabo Sao Vicente onto the Algarve\
  \ at the beginning of December we experienced the joy of flat calm seas, brilliant\
  \ sunshine and a broad reach. For about 2 hours. The final leg from Portimao on\
  \ the Algarve to Gibraltar, where we are now, was perhaps the most eventful. It\
  \ started with being becalmed in the late afternoon as we left, and just as night\
  \ fell we got some wind, and at the same time saw what we assumed were 2 parachute\
  \ flares off our port beam. We changed course accordingly and saw another vessel\
  \ heading in a similar direction &ndash; only that vessel turned out to be the Portuguese\
  \ Navy who then boarded us for an inspection. Which we passed with flying colours\
  \ and were such good mates by the end of it that Iain had them sign the guest book.\
  \ And we never did find out any more about the flares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast,\
  \ night 2 of that passage saw us running at 4 knots under staysail only and getting\
  \ seriously drenched from waves and rain whilst hand-steering&nbsp; through the\
  \ Straits of Gibraltar in a system that we had not seen coming on any forecast we\
  \ had looked at! Dolphin balances well on her sails&nbsp; when running or on the\
  \ wind using basically a rolling hitch and a few well-placed shock cords, but when\
  \ the wind is on the beam there&rsquo;s no option but to hang on to the tiller.\
  \ Something we hope to rectify over the coming months. Thus it was a long night.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>We finally arrived in Gibraltar in time for family visits and Petra&rsquo;s\
  \ first birthday, and have enjoyed Christmas and New Year celebrations here with\
  \ new-found friends. All along the way we have been delighted to find that the cruising\
  \ community is indeed like a village &ndash; people are so friendly and willing\
  \ to help, or just have a chat over a drink. A lot like the Gaffers really.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>We do however now know more people in this marina than we ever did on our\
  \ street in London! From here, we are Africa-bound. We have run out of spaces and\
  \ hidey-holes to store any more food or juice - we probably have enough to get us\
  \ all the way to NZ - the rigging has all been checked and some more adjustments\
  \ made, so it&rsquo;s time to move on. We plan a couple of short stays on the African\
  \ mainland before heading to the Canaries, then Cape Verdes which is our planned\
  \ jump-off point for the Atlantic, most likely now in early March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After\
  \ that, well, we&rsquo;ll just have to see where the wind is blowing. We would both\
  \ like to say a huge thank-you to all the Gaffers that supported and helped us during\
  \ all the planning and preparation for this trip. Without a lot of the advice, expertise,\
  \ general labour, beds, dinners and babysitting not to mention spare bits of kit\
  \ and useful gifts from so many of them we suspect we would be planning on racing\
  \ at Yogaff again this year rather than enjoying tropical sunshine. Thank you.</p>\r\
