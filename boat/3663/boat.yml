  The look of a traditional clinker hull and a lugsail rig, with the benefit of
  GRP construction.
full_description: |-
  *Pilgrim* is used as a day sailer but is also the vehicle for two experimental
  modifications.  The standard centreplate box has been replaced by a wider one
  which contains a NACA 0010 profiled centreboard that is free to pivot within the
  box a few degrees upwind, generating lift to windward.  The board pivots
  naturally from one tack to the other, without intervention from the helmsman.


  The other experiment involves changes to the rigging that allow the lugsail to
  be ‘dipped’ from one side of the mast to the other, whilst still retaining a
  boom at the foot of the sail.  (Traditional dipping lugs were always
  loose-footed sails).  The objective is to assess the benefit of having the sail
  always to leeward, clear of airflow interference from the mast.  (Lugsails are
  known to have a ‘good tack’ and a ‘bad tack’ due to back-winding when the sail
  is to windward of the mast).  See www.essexsmacksboatpilgrim.com
