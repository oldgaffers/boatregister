  The look of a traditional clinker hull and a lugsail rig, with the benefit of
  GRP construction.

full_description: "*Pilgrim* is used as a day sailer but is also the vehicle for two\
  \ experimental\nmodifications. \_The standard centreplate box has been replaced\
  \ by a wider one\nwhich contains a NACA 0010 profiled centreboard that is free to\
  \ pivot within the\nbox a few degrees upwind, generating lift to windward. \_The\
  \ board pivots\nnaturally from one tack to the other, without intervention from\
  \ the helmsman.\n\nThe other experiment involves changes to the rigging that allow\
  \ the lugsail to\nbe \u2018dipped\u2019 from one side of the mast to the other,\
  \ whilst still retaining a\nboom at the foot of the sail. \_(Traditional dipping\
  \ lugs were always\nloose-footed sails). \_The objective is to assess the benefit\
  \ of having the sail\nalways to leeward, clear of airflow interference from the\
  \ mast. \_(Lugsails are\nknown to have a \u2018good tack\u2019 and a \u2018bad tack\u2019\
  \ due to back-winding when the sail\nis to windward of the mast).\n\n"
