full_description: "<blockquote>&ldquo;Designed and built by Harry Feltham at Portsmouth\
  \ in 1930 as a Bermudan cutter. Laid up at Birdham Canal during the war. Re-rigged\
  \ as a gaff cutter in the 1960s. Found her way round to the Thames where she was\
  \ acquired by Martin Hiley in 1976.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Description from\
  \ the Drake 400, Plymouth, 1980 programme</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Hiley and his wife\
  \ cruised the boat extensively in the 1970s and early 1980s with their small family,\
  \ attending a number of OGA events along the South Coast. &#39;Nepenthe&#39; was\
  \ noted for her ability to leak, the children putting on their wellies to go below!\
  \ They had a curious habit of pushing matchsticks and plasticine into the top of\
  \ the garboard seam from the inside! In those days she was painted dark green and\
  \ had a pushpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At&nbsp;University, Arabella,&nbsp;one of her current\
  \ owners saw a photograph of Nepenthe and immediately asked about her. &nbsp;Robert\
  \ Fisher had apparently bought her as an insurance write off after she had been\
  \ sat upon by another boat in the 1987 storm, she was by then on the South East\
  \ coast. &nbsp;Full details are not known but it is assumed that her coach roof\
  \ sides and cockpit were then replaced, as was&nbsp;the&nbsp;interior. &nbsp;Much\
  \ of the work was probably&nbsp;done by Robert Fisher himself who showed some skill\
  \ as a carpenter&nbsp;- the chart table is particularly lovely.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hull\
  \ appears to have been largely unaffected although there are some sister ribs that\
  \ may have been added&nbsp;following the storm damage. Robert sailed her extenisvely\
  \ with&nbsp;his wife and son James.&nbsp;She was based on the East Coast around\
  \ Brightlingsea and Woodbridge&nbsp;and made voyages to France,&nbsp;the Baltic\
  \ and through the Dutch canals. &nbsp;Arabella was invited aboard for two summer\
  \ East Coast cruises. &nbsp;She&nbsp;later lost contact with the family but&nbsp;fondly\
  \ remembered&nbsp;the beautiful Nepenthe. &nbsp;No leaks by the way, this problem\
  \ must have&nbsp;been cured somewhere along the line, perhaps when being re-fitted\
  \ after the storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, she was spotted for sale and Arabella\
  \ and her husband Roderick bought her&nbsp;at entirely the wrong time.....the same\
  \ year as their first child was born! &nbsp;She was transported to Falmouth and\
  \ has remained in the Roseland Peninsula ever since, currently moored in St Mawes.\
  \ &nbsp;Young children and a natural cautiousness&nbsp;have dictated some conservative\
  \ inshore sailing in the area. &nbsp;She&nbsp;has been kept in good shape along\
  \ the way and is as fast as you would expect off the wind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name\
  \ Nepenthe derives from a Greek weed or herb said to grant oblivion from all ills.\
  \ &nbsp;Whilst headaches have been indeed been&nbsp;caused by owning Nepenthe (or\
  \ shall we just call them hangovers?)&nbsp;it is true to say that when you step\
  \ aboard somehow all ones cares appear to be washed away. &nbsp;</p>"
