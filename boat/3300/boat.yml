    *Calypso* was winner of the Bermudan section of OGA Solent 50th celebrations
    in 2013.
   
    She is a beautiful 18' Bermudan cutter, 3/4 rig. Built by Ponsharden Shipyard,
    Falmouth in the 1930s, reputedly to a design by Warrington Smyth.
    
    Carvel construction, pitch pine on oak, copper fastened, lead keel.
    
    Her draft is 4'2" and she sails like a dream. Complete with 12hp Dolphin direct
    drive engine. SSR registered.
    
    Whilst the accommodation is perhaps limited for extended cruising, she has two
    berths (one settee, one comfortable pipe cot - both 6 foot) and has carried her
    owners safely over many cruises between Weymouth and Eastbourne.
    
    She comes omplete with everything - right down to the cutlery and crockery as it all fits
    in nicely - as well as more essential bits like radio, etc.!
