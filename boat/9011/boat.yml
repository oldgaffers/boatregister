full_description: <p>Zinnia is the first of the Zinnia Class designed by Ed Burnett
  in conjunction with Nigel Irens. Her hull was built by the Elephant Boatyard and
  then fitted out by Fred Kemp with help from her owner Ian. She was launched in 1998,
  without an engine. Her owners Ian and Sue Pople then sailed her to the Caribbean
  via the Cape Verde Islands in 1999. She entered the 2000 Antigua Classic regatta
  with great success and sailed back home that year.</p><p>She finally succumbed to
  the allure of an inboard engine in 2003. She has regularly raced in the Solent with
  great success.</p>
