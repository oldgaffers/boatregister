full_description: "<p>Built in Fowey, 1894, &#39;Airy Mouse&#39; was designed by a\
  \ Cornish artist, Edwin Brett, in 1891 for the Commodore of the Royal Fowey Yacht\
  \ Club, Mr. Edward Atkinson. Originally a cutter, she was converted to a gaff ketch\
  \ sometime before 1988 when she was being restored by Alan Tate who wrote a letter\
  \ to the OGA Gaffers Log seeking information about her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Airy\
  \ Mouse&#39; spent most of her life prior to the 1980s on the south coast of England\
  \ with a short period in Guernsey where she was rescued from being burnt for her\
  \ copper fastenings by John Clluett. Her figurehead (a bat, &#39;Airy Mouse&#39;\
  \ being Cornish for bat) is in the Royal Fowey YC.</p>"
