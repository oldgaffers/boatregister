full_description: |-
  *Rosa & Ada* was built at Whitstable, Kent in 1908 as an oyster smack. The last
  and biggest smack built by Collar Bros., she worked with the Seasalter and Ham
  Oyster Co. at Whitstable until 1963. In 1921, a petrol-paraffin engine was
  installed and she was requisitioned as a supply tender in the Thames during the
  Second World War.


  During the 1950s whe was restored and used for racing in Kent. She was
  advertised for sale in the OGA Newsletters 1979 and 1980 by A R Winter of
  Faversham: "All spars, rigging and sails overhauled 1978-79. No engine. Vessel
  re-rigged 1972 and returned to original appearance. Asking price Â£13,000."


  She was sold to a Scottish owner who installed an engine and took her to
  Scotland where she has been sailed as a charter vessel since 1981.


  Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to
  be in the 1970s, showing 'Rosa and Ada', F105, taking part in the annual Thames
  Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend to Billingsgate.
