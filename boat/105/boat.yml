full_description: "<p>&#39;Rosa &amp; Ada&#39; was built at Whitstable, Kent in 1908\
  \ as an oyster smack. The last and biggest smack built by Collar Bros., she worked\
  \ with the Seasalter andHam Oyster Co. at Whitstable until 1963. In 1921, a petrol-paraffin\
  \ engine was installed and she was requisitioned as a supply tender in the Thames\
  \ during the Second World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1950s whe was restored and\
  \ used for racing in Kent. She was advertised for sale in the OGA Newsletters 1979\
  \ and 1980 by A R Winter of Faversham: &quot;All spars, rigging and sails overhauled\
  \ 1978-79. No engine. Vessel re-rigged 1972 and returned to original appearance.\
  \ Asking price &pound;13,000.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sold to a Scottish owner\
  \ who installed an engine and took her to Scotland where she has been sailed as\
  \ a charter vessel since 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at this archive video from\
  \ British Movietone, undated but likely to be in the 1970s, showing &#39;Rosa and\
  \ Ada&#39;, F105, taking part in the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend\
  \ to Billingsgate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"\
