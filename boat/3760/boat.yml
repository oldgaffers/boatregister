full_description: |-
  35′ bermudan sloop designed by Jack Laurent Giles, built by JJ Bickford Ltd of
  Topsham, Devon in 1956.      The basis for the Rambler design which was slightly
  smaller in length but otherwise very similar.      Designed and built for the
  director of Seagull outboard engines, her original build was to a very high
  standard using the best available materials.  He wanted a safe and comfortable
  offshore cruising boat that could be easily handled, and although never designed
  to win races, she has proved to be both safe and capable with several thousand
  miles of cruising in the current ownership.  The original specification and full
  set of construction drawings are available to confirm her provenance.
  After purchasing the boat in 2014, the current owner has taken part in various classic
  regattas and sailed her across the Atlantic, around the Caribbean and back to
  the UK via Bermuda and the Azores.  Subsequently cruised north to Scotland,
  Faroe Islands and on to the east coast of Iceland.  The crew experienced some
  severe weather conditions during these various voyages the boat performed
  admirably the whole time taking the storms in her stride and looking after the
  crew.
  
  This is a really lovely and seemingly sound cruising boat, well
  proven in recent years with money spent in all the right places by the current
  owner. Copper fastened to heavy sawn oak frames with 3 steamed oak intermediate timbers at 7” centres.
