full_description: |-
  35′ bermudan sloop designed by Jack Laurent Giles, built by JJ Bickford Ltd of
  Topsham, Devon in 1956. The basis for the Rambler design which was slightly
  smaller in length but otherwise very similar. Designed and built for the
  director of Seagull outboard engines, her original build was to a very high
  standard using the best available materials.  He wanted a safe and comfortable
  offshore cruising boat that could be easily handled, and although never designed
  to win races, she has proved to be both safe and capable with several thousand
  miles of cruising in the current ownership.  The original specification and full
  set of construction drawings are available to confirm her provenance. After
  purchasing the boat in 2014, the current owner has taken part in various classic
  regattas and sailed her across the Atlantic, around the Caribbean and back to
  the UK via Bermuda and the Azores.  Subsequently cruised north to Scotland,
  Faroe Islands and on to the east coast of Iceland.  The crew experienced some
  severe weather conditions during these various voyages the boat performed
  admirably the whole time taking the storms in her stride and looking after the
  crew.


  This is a really lovely and seemingly sound cruising boat, well proven in recent
  years with money spent in all the right places by the current owner. Copper
  fastened to heavy sawn oak frames with 3 steamed oak intermediate timbers at 7”
  centres. External lead ballast keel of 3 tons fastened with bronze keel bolts.
  Bronze strap floors on each of the heavy sawn frames fastened through the hull
  with bronze bolts. Foredeck and aft deck are straight laid T&G cedar fastened to
  the deck beams, overlaid with epoxy glass cloth sheathing and finished in grey
  deck paint. Varnished teak king plank and covering boards on the foredeck. Deck
  is raised midships to the level of the top of the toe rail to give some more
  volume and headroom to the saloon without visually disturbing the sheer line. 
  This midships deck is epoxy sheathed marine plywood. All bronze deck fittings.
  Substantial varnished teak forehatch. Coachroof finishes aft of the mast with
  low coamings, stepping up to a raised doghouse aft.  Varnished teak coamings
  with bronze framed windows.  Small butterfly skylight andgrab rails in varnished
  teak.  Sprayhood on the doghouse. Deep self draining cockpit well sheltered by
  the dog house and sprayhood.    Laid varnished teak thwarts.  Bronze boom
  gallows at the aft end of the cockpit sits on massive sampson posts. Tiller
  steering, bronze rudder stock completely new in 2019 with emergency tiller
  facility.  Masthead Bermudan sloop rig on a deck stepped painted aluminium mast.
  Varnished wooden slab reefing boom with a double tailed mainsheet to a stainless
  horse on the aft deck.  New gooseneck fitting in 2015. Stainless steel standing
  rigging, all new in 2016, to external bronze chain plates. Twin lower shrouds
  and a single cap shroud over a single set of spreaders. Single standing
  backstay. Removable inner forestay fitted in 2016 allowing for a storm jib or to

  system on the forestay. Twin alloy booming out poles fitted to tracks on the

  LED lighting throughout. Steps down over the engine box with a large quarter
  berth either side, easily accessed. Galley to starboard and chart desk to port.
  Galley has a Nelson 2 burner stove with oven and grill, installed with new gas
  pipes in 2016.  Vented gas locker under aft deck.  Single stainless sink with
  pressurised hot water. Forward facing chart desk with a small set at the level
  of the quarter berth.  Switch panel outboard under the deck head with nav
  instruments within easy reach. Hand holds along the length of the coamings for
  support when moving through the boat. Half height bulkheads separate off the
  main saloon.  Port and starboard settee berth with trotter boxes at the forward
  end and lee cloths.  Shelves outboard under the deck head. Centreline dropleaf
