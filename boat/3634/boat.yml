full_description: |-
  The Deben Lugger is a traditionally styled dayboat built in GRP with 2-pack foam
  buoyancy and oiled Iroko hardwood trim. The hull form has been designed to give
  superior performance over more more dated designs. The rig, fully complementing
  the hull, is incredibly efficient. Internally, comfort and versatility are
  assured offering space for onboard  picnicking and overnight camping with
  purpose built storage areas.


  The cockpit has ample room for six adults and kit and is CE rated for category C
  waters


  The rig is light and easily handled with a balanced lug mainsail and mizzen .
  This proven rig keeps the center of effort low making a powerful stable boat.
  Being un-stayed the carbon fibre rig is quick and easy to raise and  lower and
  allows the boat to be de-powered off the wind.


  Conventional slab reefing is used for reducing sail. The whole rigs stows within
  the length of the boat for easy, safe trailing and storage.


  She has a shallow long keel with centre plate that gives her great stability and
  enables her to sail in the shallows in as little as 16”. Coupled with excellent
  windward performance it makes her ideal for exploring estuaries and creeks. Her
  sealed centre plate is housed in the central locker maximizing space in the
  cockpit, increasing stiffness to the case and deck structure. The plate
  mechanism is easy to operate with its 10:1 gearing and is housed neatly out of
  harms way at the forward end of the locker.


  The forward spray rail has been designed to accommodate a spray hood that covers
  the flat area above the storage lockers making a great lounging area or with the
  optional camping tent, extension slats and an air mattress produces a very
  comfortable 6ft wide sleeping platform. She can also be sailed with the hood up
  unlike a lot of her competition.


  Her small aft locker is vented and is designed to take either a single burner
  camping stove or a 12L remote fuel tank whose fuel line passes into the outboard
  well, The outboard well is off-set to port and allows for a modern 4 stroke
  outboard engine of up to 6hp to be mounted and tilted clear of the water when
  sailing or left moored afloat


  Down either side of the cockpit she has two substantial iroko rails for securing
  safety harnesses, fenders and warps. The helm seats are removable allowing for
  the helm to get out of the wind and shelter low down on the sole boards. The
  same seats also store the fire extinguisher and can accommodate canvas storage
  bins, for sail ties, warps etc. Alternatively, they can be ordered as additional
  sealed storage lockers .


  A CQR or Danforth anchor can be stored on chocks on the foredeck with its warp
  being stowed in its own well behind the main mast, the 2-part oars slide forward
  up tubes on the starboard side of the centre plate casing while the blades stow
  in the locker against the casing.


  Her substantial New England stlye ‘Barn Door’ type rudder gives a light balanced
  feel with minimal weather helm, it is the same depth as the keel allowing it to
  be left mounted while beaching, sailing in the shallows or leaving on a mooring.


  Launching and recovery could not be easier on her A frame multi roller swing
  beam trailer.
