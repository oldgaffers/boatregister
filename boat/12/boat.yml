short_description: <p>&#39;Gypsy&#39; was built in Southampton by J. Ackett, probably
  in 1895. She has spent most of her life on the East Coast.</p>
full_description: "<p>Based on Mike Illingworth&#39;s research when he purchase &#39;Gypsy&#39;\
  \ in 1978, it appears she was owned at one time by two brothers named Thompson of\
  \ Hull, one of whom was over 80 years old and living in Bridlington in 1961.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>They sold &#39;Gypsy&#39; to a Merchant Navy Captain and she was taken\
  \ over by his son Mr. Albert Mason, a director of Beadles, a wholesale electrical\
  \ supplier. He sold her to OGA member Mr. Peers for &pound;200, who sold her to\
  \ Richard Bernard in 1976 after she had suffered extensive damage to her stern.\
  \ Following M. Illingworth&#39;s ownership, she was bought in January 1985 by R.\
  \ A. Eberhard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an aged photograph of &#39;Gipsy&#39; in the\
  \ Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club, Bridlington, taken in the 1924 regatta. The boat is\
  \ clearly not new and has an elongated counter tapering off to a chisel edge. It\
  \ seems &#39;Gipsy&#39; has spent all her life on the East Coast and the best estimate\
  \ of her construction date is 1895.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was class II winner in the\
  \ East Coast Old Gaffers Annual Race in 1974 and 1977.</p>"
