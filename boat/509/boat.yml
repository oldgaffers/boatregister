  *Severn* is one of ten Rivers Class Yachts built by William Crossfield and Sons
  for the Royal Mersey Yacht Club. In 2018 she was bought by Arnside Sailing Club
  and returned to the village where she was built.

full_description: "*Severn* was built in Arnside in Cumbria in 1912 by William Crossfield\
  \ & Sons.\nIn 2018 she was bought by Arnside Sailing Club with the help of a Heritage\n\
  Lottery grant to have an example of a Crossfield\u2019s boat in the village.\n\n\
  Crossfields were the leading builders of Morecambe Bay Prawners. They also built\n\
  yachts, rowing boats and dinghies, including Arthur Ransome\u2019s *Swallow* and\n\
  *Coch-y-bonddhu*. There were two boatyards operated by Crossfields in Arnside.\n\
  Beach Walk on the shore was run by William where *Severn* was built and Top Shop\n\
  on Church Hill which was run by his younger brothers and then his nephews as\nCrossfield\
  \ Brothers.\n\n*Severn* is one of ten Rivers Class Yachts built by William Crossfield\
  \ and Sons\nfor the Royal Mersey Yacht Club. Six were built in 1912 with a further\
  \ four in\n1914. If it was not for the First World War it is probable that more\
  \ would have\nbeen built. Four other Rivers Class yachts are thought to be still\
  \ in existence:\n[*Deva*](https://www.oga.org.uk/boat_register/boat/?oga_no=268),\n\
  [*Dart*](https://www.oga.org.uk/boat_register/boat/?oga_no=2041),\n[*Styx*](https://www.oga.org.uk/boat_register/boat/?oga_no=781)\
  \ (all on the OGA\nRegister) and *Esk*.\n\nThe Rivers Class were used largely for\
  \ evening racing with a season running from\nMay to July, with regatta race in July.\
  \ The boats were also raced in August at\nthe Straits Regatta on Anglesey. They\
  \ were raced for prize money. In 1914 prize\nmoney was \xA344 when the average wage\
  \ was \xA367. The Royal Mersey Yacht Club was\nbased in Rock Ferry, a then prosperous\
  \ area of Birkenhead with large houses\noverlooking the river.\n\nThe design was\
  \ based upon the Blackpool and Fleetwood Jewel Class. The boats\nwere originally\
  \ opened decked. They had a crew of three. The boats cost \xA350 each\ndelivered\
  \ afloat with a further \xA314 18s for the sails.\n\nOriginal owners of Rivers Class\
  \ boats included members of the Liverpool merchant\nelite, three silver medallists\
  \ in the 1908 Olympics, one of whom was also a\nRugby Union International and a\
  \ British Lions manager. In 1925 the 17th Earl of\nDerby, who was Commodore of the\
  \ Royal Mersey Yacht Club and Secretary of State\nfor War 1916-18 and a leading\
  \ racehorse breeder brought *Ogwen*, followed by\n*Deva* in 1926. The Derby in the\
  \ title refers to the West Derby area of\nLancashire, which includes Liverpool \_\
  rather than the city.\n\n*Severn* was originally called *Elwy* after a river in\
  \ North Wales. \_Her first\nowner was Lionel Yates Stott (1879 \u2013 1944) of West\
  \ Kirby. His father, who owned\nan iron foundry in Rossendale, died when Lionel\
  \ was 10 leaving \xA327,266 (about\n\xA33.5 million). Lionel had a master mariner\u2019\
  s certificate. Along with three other\nRiver Class owners, Lionel signed up as a\
  \ Lieutenant in RNR on August 5th 1914,\nthe day after the war broke out*. Elwy*\
  \ was the joint winner of the 1913 Rivers\nClass series, winning the Belcher Cup.\
  \ Her prize money for the year was \xA310 10s\n(\xA31200 in 2020 prices).\n\nIn\
  \ 1914 she was sold to Captain Harvey Broadbent RNR of HMS Conway, a merchant\n\
  navy training ship anchored off Rock Ferry and a stern disciplinarian. She was\n\
  named *Ribble*, after the river that flows through Preston. *Ribble* capsized\n\
  iand sunk in a Royal Mersey Race on 23 July 1914 just 11 days before the\noutbreak\
  \ of World War One in very windy conditions when rounding a racing mark\nby the\
  \ Herculaneum Dock near Toxteth on the Liverpool side of the estuary . Her\ncrew\
  \ made up of Commander Broadbent and two cadets who were wearing lifebelts\nwere\
  \ rescued.\n\nIn 1927 she was discovered on the bed of the River Mersey and raised\
  \ to the\nsurface by the Mersey Docks Board salvage boat *Salvor*. She was found\
  \ to be in\ngood condition and sold by the Receiver of Wrecks to Joe Wallace, aged\
  \ 25 of New\nBrighton, a member of the West Cheshire Yacht Club for \xA325. Joe\
  \ Wallace named\nthe boat *Severn*. He is known to have sailed *Severn* with friends\
  \ to Rhyl at\nWhitsun 1928 and to Mostyn the following year camping out in the boat.\
  \ \_It is\nthought that Joe Wallace did not keep her for very long, moving on to\
  \ bigger\nyachts. Joe went onto become Commodore of West Cheshire Yacht Club. *Severn*\
  \ is\nnext recorded in 1939 winning a race at the West Cheshire Regatta at New\n\
  Brighton and coming second in a race at Blundellsands near Formby north of\nLiverpool.\n\
  \nBy the 1960s Severn was kept at Porthmadog in North Wales owned by Bill\nSowerbutts\
  \ and his wife, who were in their late 60s. They made surprising long\njourneys\
  \ in Severn, perhaps even to France and Spain, but more evidence of this\nis needed.\
  \ In 1967 she was sold to Robin and Lesley Kyffin who kept Severn at\nPorthmadog.\
  \ Robin worked at Trawsfynydd nuclear power station, which became\nfully operational\
  \ in 1968. Robin then sells Severn to Alec Taylor, a work\ncolleague and buys a\
  \ bigger boat. Robin and Alec often sailed in convoy along\nthe Welsh coast to Abersoch\
  \ at weekends, with Alec's children staying in Robin's\nboat overnight as it was\
  \ bigger.\n\nIn 1972 *Severn* was advertised for sale by Alec Taylor of Plas Mor,\
  \ Borth y\nGest, a village on a sheltered bay south of Portmadog in Wales overlooked\
  \ by the\nhills of Snowdonia for \xA3650. Severn was brought by John Gaynor of Leigh\
  \ on Sea\nnear Southend. Severn was briefly known as *Rosevern*.\n\nMr Gaynor did\
  \ not keep *Severn* for all that long, advertising her for sale for\n\xA31100 in\
  \ 1976, Boat details include a cooker and tiolet. She was brought by Ken\nTomlinson\
  \ of Hockley, north of Southend. Around 1980 *Severn* featured in an\narticle in\
  \ the Longshoreman Magazine. *Severn* was kept at Paglesham on the\nRoach Estuary.\n\
  \nIn 1984.Ken Tomlinson advertised her for sale for \xA32000. She was brought by\
  \ a\nyoung American lady with two children for \xA3750 at Heybridge Basin who used\
  \ her\nas a family boat and for racing enjoying many splendid adventures. Eventually\n\
  she sold *Severn* on to a senior Fire Officer.\n\nJon Wainwright, owner of *Deva*,\
  \ another Rivers Class yacht, mentions competing\nagainst *Severn* in a race in\
  \ 1986 on the River Blackwater in his book \u201COnly so\nMany Tides\u201D. *Deva*\
  \ beat *Severn*. In 1987 *Severn* was recorded as been kept at\nHeybridge on the\
  \ Blackwater Estuary near Maldon in an article about *Styx*\nanother Rivers Class\
  \ yacht.\n\nAround 1999 *Severn* was moved to the River Medway in Kent. In 2013\
  \ after\nseveral years of neglect, she was taken back to Essex to the Roach Estuary\
  \ north\nof Southend where she was restored over a two year period.\n\nIn 2018 she\
  \ was bought by Arnside Sailing Club for \xA35500 funded by a Heritage\nLottery\
  \ grant and returned to the village where she was built. Moored in the\nKent Estuary\
  \ at Arnside, she lies at the top of Morecambe Bay in summer just 300\nyards away\
  \ from where she was built.\n\nPartly as a result of buying *Severn*, Arnside Sailing\
  \ Club were selected as RYA\nNorth West Sailing Club of the Year \_2019 and shortlisted\
  \ for the national award\n.\n\nA video was made of her return to Arnside.\n\nA song\
  \ has been written about *Severn* by Mike Greenwood, whose uncle was a\nfriend of\
  \ Joe Wallace.\n\nFolk duo Luna were filmed singing the song in front of *Severn*\
  \ for a BBC\nVillages by the Sea programme in 2021. A video of them singing the\
  \ song during a\nVirtual Concert during the 2020 lockdown can be seen below.\n\n\

  \nA picture of *Severn* appeared in the Sunday Times' article naming Arnside as\n\
  one of the best places to live in March 2021\n\nIn 2022 work started on a major\
  \ restoration of the boat at David Moss' boatyard\nat Skippool near Blackpool funded\
  \ by grants of \xA358,000 from National Lottery\nHeritage Fund, \xA35000 from Headley\
  \ Trust\_ (Sainsbury Family), \xA32500 Arnside\nSilverdale Grant Fund, and \xA3\
  650 Barnes Trust, Arnside. She is being returned to\nher original 1912 appearance\
  \ with an open deck. The main work is replacing her\ninternal framework which was\
  \ in poor condition. She should be back in the water\nin 2024.\n\nA Friends Group\
  \ has been set up to maintain, fund and sail her.   [Contact the\nFriends by\nemail](mailto:crossfieldyachtsevern@gmail.com?subject=Yacht%20Severn%20listed%20on%20the%20OGA%20website)\n\
