full_description: |-
  Her first owner was Whilloughby John Bean, an East Coast landowner who also
  owned Clacton Pier and used her as a pleasure boat for the pier. She was
  registered for fishing in 1905. Frederick Westhorpe Mole (born 1882) of West
  Mersea fished her as CK46. Frederick was killed when the naval stores ship
  *Industry* was torpedoed in the Irish Sea 18 October 1918. After the war she was
  bought by the Pitt family and fished out of Maldon as MN4 by Alfred and Roy
  Pitt.

  She won the West Mersea Town Cup in 1938. She fished until the 1950s as MN4 when
  she was taken out of fishing and used as a floating pontoon. David Wager
  purchased her as a wreck dug from the mud in Essex and re-built her in
  Tollesbury 1977-1983. He moved her to the Isle of Wight in 1985 and cruised her
  to Amsterdam and to Brest.

  In November 2022 she was purchased by new owners, brought back to West Mersea by
  lorry and relaunched June 2023.

  She now resides in Tollesbury.
