short_description: <p>Tramontana is a Harrison Butler Cayuca design built in 1934.</p>
full_description: "<p>When Tramontana&nbsp;changed hands in December 2012, her new\
  \ owner, Martin Hansen, wrote, &quot;I looked at eight other boats before stepping\
  \ aboard Tramontana&nbsp;in Ipswich Marina and knew right away that she was the\
  \ boat for me&quot;. For his first summer afloat,&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;took Tramontana&nbsp;up\
  \ the Thames to Tower Bridge, and along the English Channel as far as Elderberry\
  \ Cove in Torbay, where he anchored for a week, before returning to Ipswich. The\
  \ following summer, 2014, Martin again headed west along the English Channel but\
  \ this time on a one way trip, ending up in Penarth Marina, Cardiff. Along the way\
  \ he met up with eight other Harrison Butler boats in the Solent, took part in Plymouth&#39;s\
  \ Classic Boat Regatta, and called into The Isles of Scilly. The 2015 cruise saw\
  \ Tramontana&nbsp;head north to Fort William, then back south to Conwy. A new engine\
  \ was installed in 2016. The summers of 2017, 2018 and 2019 have seen Tramontana\
  \ cruising&nbsp;the Irish Sea and Southern Ireland.&nbsp;Martin hopes to explore\
  \ Northern Ireland and the Clyde in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Built in 1934, renamed\
  \ in 1953</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Staley, boatbuilder with Anderson, Ridgen &amp; Perkins,\
  \ has been in touch to say that &#39;Morena&#39;, as she was then, was built at\
  \ a total cost of &pound;1,370 6s 1d. A dinghy was built as a tender to go with\
  \ her for &pound;27 9s 6d. The Lloyd&#39;s survey for the Register of Shipping was\
  \ carried out on 16 May 1934. &#39;Morena&#39; was renamed &#39;Tramontana&#39;\
  \ in 1953. In the same year, she was in Thomas&#39;s yard Falmouth for alterations\
  \ to her accommodation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about &#39;Tramontana&#39; on\
