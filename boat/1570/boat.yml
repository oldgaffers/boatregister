full_description: She has a jib head topsail which is easily handled. The mainsail
  has 3 slab reefs, 1 in the staysail and the jib is on a Wykham-Martin furler with
  a smaller no 2 option.  With a slippery hull, new sails and a feathering propeller,
  she is very competitive when racing and a fast, dry cruising boat.  She sleeps 5,
  a double in the forepeak, 2 full length settee berths and a pilot berth in the saloon
  yet is easily single handed with a tiller pilot and the excellent sea feather winvane
  steering gear.  The saloon seats 6 around the drop leaf table, the galley has a
  2 burner cooker with grill and oven, a sink and cold water pump, and ample storage.
  The heads is uncommonly aft, handy underway and more private than amidships at night.
