short_description: "Built in 1925 for 'under \xA3300' Ariel is a well constructed\
  \ and practical small cruising gaff cutter designed by Albert Strange."
full_description: "<p>Ariel is a cutter from that doyen of yawl designers, Albert\
  \ Strange. In actual fact she is sister ship to Cherub III which was designed to\
  \ have a transom stern, but was built with a canoe stern, although still a yawl.\
  \ In 1930 another yawl rigged version, Galatea, was also built. Ariel probably remains\
  \ Strange&#39;s only cutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her early history is well documented\
  \ as her first owner JB Kirkpatrick wrote extensively about her in Yachting Monthly\
  \ between 1925 and 1933. One trip (engineless and single-handed!) was from Heybridge\
  \ to the Channel Islands and back in a week. She also sailed to Spain across Biscay\
  \ as detailed in Kirkpatrick&#39;s book &quot;Little Ship Wanderings&quot; (1933).</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In 1930 she was second in The Little Ship Club&#39;s inaugural Brightlingsea\
  \ to Ostend race. This was their first ever handicap race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998\
  \ she was substantially restored by Peter and Jim Maynard. This included a redesigned\
  \ sail plan by Gayle Heard which has radically altered her performance.</p>"
