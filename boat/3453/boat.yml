full_description: Described as a keel / centreboard day sailer designed by Joel White,
  she is in fact a development of a design by Nat Herreshoff know as the Buzzards
  Bay 12.5 from 1914. The 12.5 relates to the waterline length, in feet. The White
  design reduced the overall draft and incorporated a centre plate which dropped through
  the 600lb lead keel. The original design was of carvel construction with 1/2 cedar
  planks screwed to steam bent oak ribs; the Widget design has been further modified
  to allow cedar strip and epoxy construction which has been glass sheathed.
