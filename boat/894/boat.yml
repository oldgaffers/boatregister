full_description: "**History**\n\n**1930 to 1948** My Quest was built in 1930 to lines\
  \ published in Yachting\nMonthly in August 1929. The article was an account by yachting\
  \ author of \u201CTern\u201D\nfame, Claud Worth, of the maiden voyage of a small\
  \ half decker he had had built\nfor single-handed day sailing. The designer was\
  \ George Cozens, described by\nWorth as \u201C*the late Arthur Payne\u2019s draughtsman*\u201D\
  \ and Worth comments that the\nplans are \u201C*the work of a master*\u201D. That\
  \ first hull was \u201CSwift\u201D, built in Kent,\nand Worth ends his article:\
  \ *\u201C\u2026she is perfectly suited to the purposes for which\nshe was built\
  \ and, with a small well and well-arched cabin top, would make an\nadmirable little\
  \ single-handed cruiser*\u201D.\n\nHis advice was followed that same winter by Ernest\
  \ L Woods (boat builder in\nHorning, Norfolk) who built My Quest for Mr H.J. Suffling\
  \ and launched her in\nthe spring of 1930. Her name was Melody then, changed to\
  \ Quest the following\nyear, and some years later to My Quest. She is of carvel\
  \ construction, pitch\npine on steamed oak frames, with solid oak floors and a lead\
  \ keel.\n\nH.J. Suffling kept Quest (as she then still was) until his death aged\
  \ 75 in\n1948.\n\n**1949 to 1967**Suffling\u2019s widow advertised the boat for\
  \ sale the following year\nand she was purchased by Mr. William H Taylor from Derby.\
  \ An old friend of\nTaylor\u2019s who sailed with him believes the price paid for\
  \ the boat in 1949 was in\nthe region of \xA3800. Mr.Taylor initially registered\
  \ the boat with Lloyds as\n\u201CQuest\u201D (as Suffling had before him) but there\
  \ may have been some issue with a\nduplication of names because the following year\
  \ she had been renamed \u201CMy Quest\u201D.\nShe continued to be kept at the yard\
  \ she\u2019d been built in at Horning in Norfolk\nbut was sailed to Oulton Broad\
  \ in the summer.\n\nWilliam Taylor sold the boat in 1967. The engine (2 cylinder\
  \ Ailsa Craig) needed\nreplacing and he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to do\
  \ this without causing\nstructural damage.\n\n**1967 to 1969**The new owner was\
  \ Mr Terry Ward, living at that time in Norwich.\nMr Ward had admired My Quest for\
  \ many years in Oulton Broad, and once he had\nacquired her, he successfully replaced\
  \ the engine with an Albin built in 1965\n(no damage done!) Terry Ward sailed My\
  \ Quest to Woodbridge where he kept her in\nthe Tidemill Marina for a couple of\
  \ years until 1969 when Mr Taylor bought her\nback.\n\n**1969 to 1978**William Taylor\
  \ again! He had tried owning a newer Bermudan\nrigged boat but didn\u2019t keep\
  \ it for long and clearly My Quest was his real love -\nalthough by the time he\
  \ bought her back he was already over 80 years old. Photos\nand memories from his\
  \ grandsons seem to indicate that he kept her on the Deben\nhereafter and he was\
  \ 90 when he sold her again in 1978. At some point in that\ntime, as well as local\
  \ cruising, he made a crossing to the Netherlands with a\nfamily member. Taylor\u2019\
  s owning and maintaining the boat for a total of 27 years\nno doubt contributed\
  \ significantly to her longevity.\n\n**1979 to 1983**The next owner remains a mystery\
  \ so far \u2013 his name was John D.\nParfitt and his address on the Lloyds Register\
  \ is given as Sevenoaks in Kent. He\ngave his profession on the documents as \u201C\
  diamond mounter\u201D but he hasn\u2019t been\ntracked down yet. He moved My Quest\
  \ to Heybridge Basin in Essex and she had\napparently not been lying there long\
  \ when she was spotted by her next owner.\nIt\u2019s not known what use Parfitt\
  \ had of the boat. The hull, having been cream in\ncolour when known in Norfolk\
  \ and in Woodbridge, had by 1983 acquired the pale\nblue colour which she then kept\
  \ for over 30 years.\n\n**1983 to 1984**Mark Wakelin acquired her in 1983 but kept\
  \ her for only one\nseason as he had a tough and discouraging solo experience on\
  \ board which lead to\nhim putting the boat up for sale again.\n\n**1984 to 2014**\
  \ My Quest was lucky enough to be acquired next by Richard Gavin\nwho restored,\
  \ maintained and sailed her for the next 30 years. She became a\nwell-known sight\
  \ at East Coast OGA events where he sailed her skilfully and\nwithout any engine\
  \ back-up (as he had removed the Albin in 1996). Richard\ncruised her extensively,\
  \ visiting the Scilly Isles, Brest and Douarnenez, the\nChannel Islands and went\
  \ as far north as Den Helder. Richard parted with her\nreluctantly in 2014.\n\n\
  **2014 to 2018**Nick Howells was next \u2013 he had My Quest lifted out at Woodbridge\n\
  Boatyard (Eversons) where he repainted her pale blue hull a bright pea green and\n\
  installed a Yanmar engine. Unfortunately Nick\u2019s circumstances changed and he\
  \ was\nnever able to get My Quest launched. She stayed ashore for 4 years until\n\
  acquired by her current owners.\n\n**2018 - present**Howard Wheelton, Sue Lewis\
  \ and Barry Edwards are joint owners.\nHer hull is cream in colour again. She attended\
  \ Ostend at Anchor in 2019,\nrevisited her birthplace in the Norfolk Broads in 2020\
  \ and she regularly sails\nthe east coast rivers from her base in Harwich or from\
  \ Walton-on-the-Naze.\_\n\nSources:\n\nYachting Monthly Aug 1929\n\nEastern Daily\
