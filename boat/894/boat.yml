full_description: "<p><strong>History</strong></p><p><strong>1930 to 1948</strong>\
  \ My Quest was built in 1930 to lines published in Yachting Monthly in August 1929.\
  \ The article was an account by yachting author of \u201CTern\u201D fame, Claud\
  \ Worth, of the maiden voyage of a small half decker he had had built for single-handed\
  \ day sailing. The designer was George Cozens, described by Worth as \u201C<em>the\
  \ late Arthur Payne\u2019s draughtsman</em>\u201D and Worth comments that the plans\
  \ are \u201C<em>the work of a master</em>\u201D. That first hull was \u201CSwift\u201D\
  , built in Kent, and Worth ends his article: <em>\u201C\u2026she is perfectly suited\
  \ to the purposes for which she was built and, with a small well and well-arched\
  \ cabin top, would make an admirable little single-handed cruiser</em>\u201D.</p><p>His\
  \ advice was followed that same winter by Ernest L Woods (boat builder in Horning,\
  \ Norfolk) who built My Quest for Mr H.J. Suffling and launched her in the spring\
  \ of 1930. Her name was Melody then, changed to Quest the following year, and some\
  \ years later to My Quest. She is of carvel construction, pitch pine on steamed\
  \ oak frames, with solid oak floors and a lead keel.</p><p>H.J. Suffling kept Quest\
  \ (as she then still was) until his death aged 75 in 1948.</p><p><strong>1949 to\
  \ 1967</strong>Suffling\u2019s widow advertised the boat for sale the following\
  \ year and she was purchased by Mr. William H Taylor from Derby. An old friend of\
  \ Taylor\u2019s who sailed with him believes the price paid for the boat in 1949\
  \ was in the region of \xA3800. Mr.Taylor initially registered the boat with Lloyds\
  \ as \u201CQuest\u201D (as Suffling had before him) but there may have been some\
  \ issue with a duplication of names because the following year she had been renamed\
  \ \u201CMy Quest\u201D. She continued to be kept at the yard she\u2019d been built\
  \ in at Horning in Norfolk but was sailed to Oulton Broad in the summer.</p><p>William\
  \ Taylor sold the boat in 1967. The engine (2 cylinder Ailsa Craig) needed replacing\
  \ and he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without causing structural\
  \ damage.</p><p><strong>1967 to 1969</strong>The new owner was Mr Terry Ward, living\
  \ at that time in Norwich. Mr Ward had admired My Quest for many years in Oulton\
  \ Broad, and once he had acquired her, he successfully replaced the engine with\
  \ an Albin built in 1965 (no damage done!) Terry Ward sailed My Quest to Woodbridge\
  \ where he kept her in the Tidemill Marina for a couple of years until 1969 when\
  \ Mr Taylor bought her back.</p><p><strong>1969 to 1978</strong>William Taylor again!\
  \ He had tried owning a newer Bermudan rigged boat but didn\u2019t keep it for long\
  \ and clearly My Quest was his real love - although by the time he bought her back\
  \ he was already over 80 years old. Photos and memories from his grandsons seem\
  \ to indicate that he kept her on the Deben hereafter and he was 90 when he sold\
  \ her again in 1978. At some point in that time, as well as local cruising, he made\
  \ a crossing to the Netherlands with a family member. Taylor\u2019s owning and maintaining\
  \ the boat for a total of 27 years no doubt contributed significantly to her longevity.</p><p><strong>1979\
  \ to 1983</strong>The next owner remains a mystery so far \u2013 his name was John\
  \ D. Parfitt and his address on the Lloyds Register is given as Sevenoaks in Kent.\
  \ He gave his profession on the documents as \u201Cdiamond mounter\u201D but he\
  \ hasn\u2019t been tracked down yet. He moved My Quest to Heybridge Basin in Essex\
  \ and she had apparently not been lying there long when she was spotted by her next\
  \ owner. It\u2019s not known what use Parfitt had of the boat. The hull, having\
  \ been cream in colour when known in Norfolk and in Woodbridge, had by 1983 acquired\
  \ the pale blue colour which she then kept for over 30 years.</p><p><strong>1983\
  \ to 1984</strong>Mark Wakelin acquired her in 1983 but kept her for only one season\
  \ as he had a tough and discouraging solo experience on board which lead to him\
  \ putting the boat up for sale again.</p><p><strong>1984 to 2014 </strong>My Quest\
  \ was lucky enough to be acquired next by Richard Gavin who restored, maintained\
  \ and sailed her for the next 30 years. She became a well-known sight at East Coast\
  \ OGA events where he sailed her skilfully and without any engine back-up (as he\
  \ had removed the Albin in 1996). Richard cruised her extensively, visiting the\
  \ Scilly Isles, Brest and Douarnenez, the Channel Islands and went as far north\
  \ as Den Helder. Richard parted with her reluctantly in 2014.</p><p><strong>2014\
  \ to 2018</strong>Nick Howells was next \u2013 he had My Quest lifted out at Woodbridge\
  \ Boatyard (Eversons) where he repainted her pale blue hull a bright pea green and\
  \ installed a Yanmar engine. Unfortunately Nick\u2019s circumstances changed and\
  \ he was never able to get My Quest launched. She stayed ashore for 4 years until\
  \ acquired by her current owners.</p><p><strong>2018 - present</strong>Howard Wheelton,\
  \ Sue Lewis and Barry Edwards are joint owners. Her hull is cream in colour again,\
  \ she attended Ostend at Anchor in 2019 and she should be seen sailing east coast\
  \ waters again once Covid allows.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Yachting Monthly Aug 1929</p><p>Eastern\
