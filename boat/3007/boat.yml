full_description: <p>There is evidence that, like Heard's early Picarooners, Selkie
  had a mizzen mast on the port quarter and may have been lug-rigged. She then had
  a taller mast, longer bowsprit and a gaff rig. She may have had an outboard well
  installed and was kept on a swinging mooring in the West Country.</p><p>She was
  bought in 2006 by a Mr Bullough, in Bere Ferris, who launched her twice. Oliver
  and Susan Nares purchased her in 2010 and have carried out much work. They have
  installed a hatch in the foredeck and both the fore and afterdecks now have laid
  iroko decking. Buoyancy tanks have been made for each side with side benches above.
  The cockpit has a slatted iroko floor and the running rigging has been improved.
  She retains her original tan main, but now has a slightly larger cream jib.</p>
