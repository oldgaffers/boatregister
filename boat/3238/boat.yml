full_description: She is currently lying in Santa Cruz de Teneriffe having been sailed
  from Cowes to Lanzarotte in 2017 by her current owner. She has many unique modern
  touches to add to her classic hull and rig. In particular her hybrid diesel engine
  /generator/electric propulsion system which makes her extremely convenient as a
  live- aboard. She is fitted out for blue water cruising and is an excellent passage
  maker.
