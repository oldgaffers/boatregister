short_description: <p>The Rigmor von Gluckstadt is the oldest seaworthy sailing ship
  in Germany, originally built as a customs cutter in 1853 she is now a museum ship
  based on the River Elbe.</p>
full_description: "<p>Built as &#39;Zollkreuzer no.5&#39; (customs cruiser) by Johann\
  \ Paul Schroeder in 1853, she was seized by the Prussians and decommissioned in\
  \ 1864. Re-named Treue (Fidelity) in 1874 by her new owner G J Matzen, she became\
  \ a &#39;Austerntransport&#39; (cargo vessel) before being sold to a Danish owner.\
  \ Once more re-named, Manna, she was used as a &#39;Frachtschiff&#39; (cargo ship)\
  \ for many years. Following several changes of ownership, she was converted in 1917,\
  \ under the new name Rigmor, to a &#39;Steinfischer&#39; (stone fisher).</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>During the 1980s, having been sold as a leisure sailing craft when she was\
  \ no longer viable for dredging, Rigmor began to deteriorate. A group was established\
  \ to buy and restore the ship, returning her to Gluckstadt in 1992. For more information,\
