full_description: |-
  *Chough* was purchased by Graham Coggins as a bare hull from Gaffers and Luggers
  in 1976. He is a very skilled carpenter and finished her off beautifully with
  teak laid side decks etc. including making all the masts and rigging. Sails were
  made by SKB and on the main was Tosher 14. Graham then registered her as a
  fishing boat and obtained the number BR14 which is a Bridgwater Somerset
  registration. *Chough* changed hands in 1980 and kept the fishing registration
  going until 2003 when she was sold. Under this ownership she cruised to Brittany
  before being brought back to the UK.


  After a period of neglect in Surrey *Chough* was offered back to the second
  owner gratis at Christmas 2022. Her engine had seized solid, and there are plans
  to replace it in the Autumn of 2024, while the rest of her is being restored to
  her former glory by her second owner with help from Graham Coggins, her original
  owner.
