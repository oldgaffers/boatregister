  is a Morecambe Bay Prawner. In 2019, she is undergoing a major restoration in the
  midlands
full_description: "Oral history tells that *Charlotte* was built by Crossfield\n of\
  \ Arnside in 1893. She is likely to have been constructed as a fishing\n vessel\
  \ though her overall proportions and rakish stem might suggest lines of a yacht;\n\
  \ or at least having been rebuilt along\n the lines of a yacht in later life. Of\
  \ course, Crossfield was known to produce\n both fishing boats and yachts, and whilst\
  \ the archives have yet to reveal *Charlotte's*\n earliest history, her construction\
  \ with robust grown oak frames, long keel and\n shallow draught speak of working-boat\
  \ heritage in the north west coastal region\n of England.\n \n What is sure is that\
  \ by 1975 she was lying on her side\n in a boat yard at Watermouth Cove, North Devon.\
  \ Julian Lamb recalls that,\n as a young lad, he fell in love with *Charlotte&rsquo;s*\
  \ elegant abandoned\n hull and spent many hours playing on her decks and in the\
  \ cockpit during regular\n camping holidays from the Midlands.  Returning each year,\
  \ he went looking\n for *Charlotte*.  In 1977, he discovered she had been renovated:\n\
  \ fresh paint, new rigging, and upright once more.  In 1979, she was afloat\n and\
  \ moored in the cove, but in 1980 she had gone: and Julian didn&rsquo;t see\n her\
  \ again at Watermouth. \n \n *Charlotte* had been bought by brothers Ray and Mike\
  \ Johnson in Cardiff and in 1980\n she was on a 'trot mooring' at Cardiff Yacht\
  \ Club.  Graham Cuthill, a long-term friend\n of the brothers recalls that *Charlotte*\
  \ was actually in poor condition\n and a third brother, Jim, was appalled at the\
  \ state of her.  Work was carried-out\n to keep her afloat including some new planking\
  \ and reinforcement of cracked frames.  \n During this period, her decks and cabin\
  \ were also rebuilt and her sheer aft raised\n by several inches.\n \n When Ray\
  \ Johnson died aged in his 50s, brother\n Jim stepped in to help Mike continue with\
  \ the boat.  Ray&rsquo;s ashes were\n placed in a purpose made wooden box and, together\
  \ with another box containing\n the ashes of a sailing friend, Fred Patterson, they\
  \ were wedged into *Charlotte&rsquo;s*\n deck beams.  Whilst *Charlotte* was occasionally\
  \ under sail she was\n often used as a place for the friends to gather and drink\
  \ tea with her ex-British\n Rail coal stove providing warmth on cold days.\n \n\
  \ By 2015 she was still\n afloat but very tired.  When the last Johnson brother\
  \ died a plan was devised\n by local gaffer enthusiasts to save and restore her.\
  \  The Charlotte Restoration\n Group was formed &ndash; soon to be known as the\
  \ Charlotteers &ndash; and accommodation\n was found in the workshop at World of\
  \ Boats in Cardiff.\n \n Hope was\n high that she could be returned to the water\
  \ with only light recommissioning work. \n However, as is often the case, close\
  \ inspection revealed that she needed major\n rebuilding of frames and planking.\
  \ The Charlotteers committed to the rebuild and\n she was stripped and dissembled\
  \ with all usable parts placed into storage. \n One or two planks at the sheer line\
  \ were left in place with a scaffold of stout\n batons to ensure her hull remained\
  \ in shape.  Her frames were removed one\n at a time and remade using green oak\
  \ obtained from Coedcochwyn Park near Cardiff\n and her stern post was remade using\
  \ wood from a lock gate. Regrettably, World\n of Boats ceased trading in 2018 and\
  \ the future for *Charlotte* became\n uncertain. Options to relocate *Charlotte*\
  \ were explored but none seemed\n ideal.  Work continued into 2019 and by some remarkable\
  \ happenstance a new\n custodian stepped forward: Julian Lamb &ndash; the lad who\
  \ had played on her decks\n over forty years earlier.\n \n *Charlotte* had gained\
  \ something\n of a folklore status in Julian's family - she was his first love after\n\
  \ which many restoration projects followed: classic cars, houses and even an aeroplane.\
  \ \n One Sunday afternoon in 2019 Julian recounted the story of *Charlotte*\n to\
  \ his youngest son, Ted, who then searched her out on the internet.  Julian\n was\
  \ astonished to discover she still existed and was in need of assistance. \n Contact\
  \ was established with the Charlotteers and a trip to Cardiff was arranged\n to\
  \ see *Charlotte* again.  Several return trips followed, including\n one with an\
  \ 18-ton HIAB lorry!  Over the autumn of 2019 *Charlotte*\n was transported to the\
  \ Midlands to start the next phase of her restoration.  \n\nJulian has a background\
  \ in engineering and industrial archaeology and says\n that enjoyment of *Charlotte&rsquo;s*\
  \ restoration is the most important\n objective: it is not about a rush to the finish\
  \ line.  Having said this,\n he plans to sail her from Watermouth Cove sometime\
  \ between 2025 and 2030 to\n mark fifty years since he played on her decks as a\
  \ child. \n \n If you know anything about *Charlotte&rsquo;s* life prior to 1975\
  \ Julian would\n be delighted to hear from you. \""
