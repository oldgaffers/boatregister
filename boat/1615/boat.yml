short_description: <p>Designed and built by Crossfield of Arnside&nbsp;in 1893, &#39;Charlotte&#39;
  is a Morecambe Bay Prawner. In 2019, she is undergoing a major restoration in the
  midlands</p>
full_description: "<p>Oral history tells that &#39;Charlotte&#39; was built by Crossfield\
  \ of Arnside in 1893.&nbsp; She is likely to have been constructed as a fishing\
  \ vessel &ndash; a Morcambe Bay Prawner &ndash; though her overall proportions and\
  \ rakish stem might suggest lines of a yacht; or at least having been rebuilt along\
  \ the lines of a yacht in later life.&nbsp; Of course, Crossfield was known to produce\
  \ both fishing boats and yachts, and whilst the archives have yet to reveal &#39;Charlotte&rsquo;s&#39;\
  \ earliest history, her construction with robust grown oak frames, long keel and\
  \ shallow draught speak of working-boat heritage in the north west coastal region\
  \ of England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is sure is that by 1975 she was lying on her side\
  \ in a boat yard at Watermouth Cove, North Devon.&nbsp; Julian Lamb recalls that,\
  \ as a young lad, he fell in love with &#39;Charlotte&rsquo;s&#39; elegant abandoned\
  \ hull and spent many hours playing on her decks and in the cockpit during regular\
  \ camping holidays from the Midlands.&nbsp; Returning each year, he went looking\
  \ for &#39;Charlotte&#39;.&nbsp; In 1977, he discovered she had been renovated:\
  \ fresh paint, new rigging, and upright once more.&nbsp; In 1979, she was afloat\
  \ and moored in the cove, but in 1980 she had gone: and Julian didn&rsquo;t see\
  \ her again at Watermouth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Charlotte&#39; had been bought\
  \ by brothers Ray and Mike Johnson in Cardiff and in 1980 she was on a &lsquo;trot\
  \ mooring&rsquo; at Cardiff Yacht Club.&nbsp; Graham Cuthill, a long-term friend\
  \ of the brothers recalls that &#39;Charlotte&#39; was actually in poor condition\
  \ and a third brother, Jim, was appalled at the state of her. &nbsp;Work was carried-out\
  \ to keep her afloat including some new planking and reinforcement of cracked frames.&nbsp;&nbsp;\
  \ During this period, her decks and cabin were also rebuilt and her sheer aft raised\
  \ by several inches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Ray Johnson died aged in his 50s, brother\
  \ Jim stepped in to help Mike continue with the boat.&nbsp; Ray&rsquo;s ashes were\
  \ placed in a purpose made wooden box and, together with another box containing\
  \ the ashes of a sailing friend, Fred Patterson, they were wedged into &#39;Charlotte&rsquo;s&#39;\
  \ deck beams.&nbsp; Whilst &#39;Charlotte&#39; was occasionally under sail she was\
  \ often used as a place for the friends to gather and drink tea with her ex-British\
  \ Rail coal stove providing warmth on cold days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2015 she was still\
  \ afloat but very tired.&nbsp; When the last Johnson brother died a plan was devised\
  \ by local gaffer enthusiasts to save and restore her.&nbsp; The Charlotte Restoration\
  \ Group was formed &ndash; soon to be known as the Charlotteers &ndash; and accommodation\
  \ was found in the workshop at World of Boats in Cardiff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope was\
  \ high that she could be returned to the water with only light recommissioning work.&nbsp;\
  \ However, as is often the case, close inspection revealed that she needed major\
  \ rebuilding of frames and planking. The Charlotteers committed to the rebuild and\
  \ she was stripped and dissembled with all usable parts placed into storage.&nbsp;\
  \ One or two planks at the sheer line were left in place with a scaffold of stout\
  \ batons to ensure her hull remained in shape.&nbsp; Her frames were removed one\
  \ at a time and remade using green oak obtained from Coedcochwyn Park near Cardiff\
  \ and her stern post was remade using wood from a lock gate. Regrettably, World\
  \ of Boats ceased trading in 2018 and the future for &#39;Charlotte&#39; became\
  \ uncertain. Options to relocate &#39;Charlotte&#39; were explored but none seemed\
  \ ideal.&nbsp; Work continued into 2019 and by some remarkable happenstance a new\
  \ custodian stepped forward: Julian Lamb &ndash; the lad who had played on her decks\
  \ over forty years earlier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Charlotte&#39; had gained something\
  \ of a folklore status in Julian&rsquo;s family &ndash; she was his first love after\
  \ which many restoration projects followed: classic cars, houses and even an aeroplane.&nbsp;\
  \ One Sunday afternoon in 2019 Julian recounted the story of&nbsp;&#39;Charlotte&#39;\
  \ to his youngest son, Ted, who then searched her out on the internet.&nbsp; Julian\
  \ was astonished to discover she still existed and was in need of assistance.&nbsp;\
  \ Contact was established with the Charlotteers and a trip to Cardiff was arranged\
  \ to see &#39;Charlotte&#39; again.&nbsp; Several return trips followed, including\
  \ one with an 18-ton HIAB lorry!&nbsp; Over the autumn of 2019 &#39;Charlotte&#39;\
  \ was transported to the Midlands to start the next phase of her restoration.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Julian has a background in engineering and industrial archaeology and says\
  \ that enjoyment of &#39;Charlotte&rsquo;s&#39; restoration is the most important\
  \ objective: it is not about a rush to the finish line.&nbsp; Having said this,\
  \ he plans to sail her from Watermouth Cove sometime between 2025 &ndash; 2030 to\
  \ mark fifty years since he played on her decks as a child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\
  \ know anything about &#39;Charlotte&rsquo;s&#39; life prior to 1975 Julian would\
  \ be delighted to hear from you.</p>"
