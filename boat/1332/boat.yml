full_description: |-
  Her name at the time of launching is not known. She was built as a smack and was
  refitted and converted from sail to motor in 1935. She came into the possession
  of Mr. Charles Chase of Kings Lynn in 1912, and was re-named *Charles
  Josephine*. In 1945 she was re-named *Mermaid*, by Worfolk Bros., Kings Lynn,
  who refitted and sold her to T. Lineham of Sutton Bridge. She fished the Wash
  until 1980.


  Bought by Jack Waterhouse & his son of Woodrolfe Boatyard, Tollesbury, Essex,
  they rebuilt her back to her early state of sail, (Tan main, white headsails and
  topsail). They started to rebuild her in October 1981 renewing frames & floors.
  70% of the planking, covering boards, stanchions etc. also mast spars sand
  rigging. The sails are by Tailors of Maldon. The next owners had known her for
  thirty years and always admired her. They farmed by the river 'Nene at Sutton
  Bridge where she was berthed and saw her most days passing by to fish in the
  Wash.
