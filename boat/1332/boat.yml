  the possession of Mr. Charles Chase of Kings Lynn in 1912, and was re-named 'Charles
  Josephine.  She was re-named in 1945 Mermaid, by Worfolk Bros., Kings Lynn, who
  refitted and sold her to T. Lineham of Sutton Bridge.  She fished the Wash until
  1980.  Bought by Jack Waterhouse & his son of Woodrolfe Boatyard, Tollesbury, Essex,
  who rebuilt her back to her early state of sail, (Tan main, white headsails and
