full_description: Her name at the time of launching is not known.  She was built as
  a smack and was refitted and converted from sail to motor in 1935.  She came into
  the possession of Mr. Charles Chase of Kings Lynn in 1912, and was re-named 'Charles
  Josephine.  She was re-named in 1945 Mermaid, by Worfolk Bros., Kings Lynn, who
  refitted and sold her to T. Lineham of Sutton Bridge.  She fished the Wash until
  1980.  Bought by Jack Waterhouse & his son of Woodrolfe Boatyard, Tollesbury, Essex,
  who rebuilt her back to her early state of sail, (Tan main, white headsails and
  topsail) in 1980 from Tony Lineham.  They started to rebuild her in October 1981
  renewing frames & floors. 70% of the planking, covering boards, stanchions etc.
  also mast spars sand rigging.  The sails are by Tailors of Maldon.  The next owners
  had known her for thirty years and always admired her.  They farmed by the river
  'Nene at Sutton Bridge where she was berthed and saw her most days passing by to
  fish in the Wash.
