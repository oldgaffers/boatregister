full_description: '<p>Dudley Dix had a design brief to create a small yacht in the
  style of a traditional working boat. The boat had to be a trailer sailer, with minimal
  draft; offering respectable sailing performance under sail.<br>

  The first 55 boats were built in South Africa before production moved to the UK
  in 2004. There is an active class association.</p>'
