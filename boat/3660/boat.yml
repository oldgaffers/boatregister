    A beautiful sailing dinghy in yellow cedar strip plank with classic lug rig in
    tan Clipper Canvas. Glassed inside and out so all the charm of a wooden boat
    with the strength and low maintenance of epoxy sheathing. Built at the
    Boatbuilding Academy in 2023. Thwart, decks, gunwale and transom in iroko and
    sapele. Quality gunmetal bronze fittings by Davey. Bespoke combi trailer by
    Admiral and bespoke cover by Exe Sails (both as new). A delightful and much
    admired dayboat – stable, spacious and easy to sail. Materials, sails and
    trailer cost in excess of £10,000 and took around 2,400 man-hours to build.
    Viewable at Cargreen Yacht Club. Yacht purchase forces reluctant sale.
