short_description: |-
  One off design probably based on the Poole fishing boats/pilot boats of the
  time. Cruised to the Baltic before First World War and taken down through the
  French canals in the winter of 1919-20 returning back to South Coast of England
  in 1920. Moved to East Coast just before Second World War and thought to have
  spent the war at Pin Mill. Converted to Bermudan in 1950 and back to gaff in
  1982. Moved back to the South Coast in 1983 and underwent a major refit 1984-7,
  Lone Wolf has been a regular participant in Solent area events ever since.

  Nothing other than a name is known about her first owner but much is written
  about the cruises of her second owner Henry Carson and his sister Beryl. They
  bought the boat in 1911 and cruised her around the Solent and down the West
  Country. In 1912 they sailed up to the Baltic to Copenhagen. The trip is
  recorded in the CA Bulletin and an original log.


  In May 1913 they returned and sailed her up to Russia at Kronstadt before
  returning to Cowes on September 23rd. They met Erskine Childers in Kalmar on
  July 29th. Both Carson and Childers record the meeting in their logs. Carson won
  the CA's Love Cup in 1912 and 1913 for their cruise and the RCC's Romola Cup in
  1913. In October 1919 they sailed from Cowes to Le Havre, taking the boat down
  the French Canals to the Mediterranean arriving in January 1920. Carson then
  sailed the boat to Sete and took her through the Canal du Midi to Bordeaux. From
  there in August 1920 he and Beryl sailed the boat back to England. This trip is
  described in 6 Yachting Monthly articles published in 1921 and 1922. They sold
  the boat in January 1922.


  After Carson she had three owners in quick succession but in 1932 she was bought
  by Joseph Mew, a brewer on the Isle of Wight. He sailed her in the early Round
  the Island Races. A Beken photograph survives from this time.


  In 1939 she was sold and taken to the East Coast. In 1950 she was converted to
  Bermudan at Dan Web and Feesey, then bought by Edgar Traylen in 1960. Whilst on
  the slip being fitted out she was recognised by Carson's daughter and this is
  how her history came to light. Traylen kept her on the Walton Backwaters for 20
  years before selling her to Richard Barnard who converted her back to a gaff
  cutter using the Bermudan mast. However the rig was not powerful and the boat
  needed a good breeze to get her going.


  Pat and Dick Dawson bought her in 1983 and sailed her back to the South Coast.
  She leaked a lot on this trip, resulting in a three year refit In 1989 the
  Dawsons replaced the rig based on the dimensions of her original rig recorded in
  her 1911 log. In their ownership she has cruised the south coast of England from
  Ramsgate to the Helford river in Cornwall, across the Channel to Normandy, the
  Channel Islands and the North Brittany coast.
