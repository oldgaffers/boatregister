short_description: <p>One off design probably based on the Poole fishing boats/pilot
  boats of the time. Cruised to the Baltic before First World War and taken down through
  the French canals in the winter of 1919-20 returning back to South Coast of England
  in 1920. Moved to East Coast just before Second World War and thought to have spent
  the war at Pin Mill. Converted to Bermudan in 1950 and back to gaff in 1982. Moved
  back to the South Coast in 1983 and underwent a major refit 1984-7, Lone Wolf has
  been a regular participant in Solent area events ever since.</p>
full_description: "<p>Nothing other than a name is known about her first owner but\
  \ much is written about the cruises of her second owner Henry Carson and his sister\
  \ Beryl. They bought the boat in 1911 and cruised her around the Solent and down\
  \ the West Country. In 1912 they sailed up to the Baltic to Copenhagen. The trip\
  \ is recorded in the CA Bulletin and an original log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 1913\
  \ they returned and sailed her up to Russia at Kronstadt before returning to Cowes\
  \ on September 23rd. They met Erskine Childers in Kalmar on July 29th. Both Carson\
  \ and Childers record the meeting in their logs. Carson won the CA&#39;s Love Cup\
  \ in 1912 and 1913 for their cruise and the RCC&#39;s Romola Cup in 1913. In October\
  \ 1919 they sailed from Cowes to Le Havre, taking the boat down the French Canals\
  \ to the Mediterranean arriving in January 1920. Carson then sailed the boat to\
  \ Sete and took her through the Canal du Midi to Bordeaux. From there in August\
  \ 1920 he and Beryl sailed the boat back to England. This trip is described in 6\
  \ Yachting Monthly articles published in 1921 and 1922. They sold the boat in January\
  \ 1922.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Carson she had three owners in quick succession but\
  \ in 1932 she was bought by Joseph Mew, a brewer on the Isle of Wight. He sailed\
  \ her in the early Round the Island Races. A Beken photograph survives from this\
  \ time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1939 she was sold and taken to the East Coast. In 1950\
  \ she was converted to Bermudan at Dan Web and Feesey, then bought by Edgar Traylen\
  \ in 1960. Whilst on the slip being fitted out she was recognised by Carson&#39;s\
  \ daughter and this is how her history came to light. Traylen kept her on the Walton\
  \ Backwaters for 20 years before selling her to Richard Barnard who converted her\
  \ back to a gaff cutter using the Bermudan mast. However the rig was not powerful\
  \ and the boat needed a good breeze to get her going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pat and Dick\
  \ Dawson bought her in 1983 and sailed her back to the South Coast. She leaked a\
  \ lot on this trip, resulting in a three year refit In 1989 the Dawsons replaced\
  \ the rig based on the dimensions of her original rig recorded in her 1911 log.\
  \ In their ownership she has cruised the south coast of England from Ramsgate to\
  \ the Helford river in Cornwall, across the Channel to Normandy, the Channel Islands\
  \ and the North Brittany coast.</p>"

   The 1905 gaff cutter *Lone Wolf* is in search of pastures new.  It’s time for her to move on, in company with
   enthusiastic new owners who can give her the love and care she deserves. Dick & Pat Dawson found her
   in Rowhedge in 1983, just returned to gaff rig after a Bermudian interlude.  After a refit she has
   given nearly 40 years of cruising joy in return for Dick & Pat’s support.
   *Lone Wolf* was built by Ashton & Kilner in Poole, 26.4 ft on deck, pine on oak, bronze fastened with
   lead keel.

   A Yanmar 3GM diesel is fitted. 

   In 1912/13 she cruised the Baltic, and just after the First World War the Mediterranean via the French canals.
   More recently she has remained in English and French waters, cruising the English Channel from her home for
   the last few decades in Bursledon’s Elephant Boatyard and latterly in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight.
   Since the early 1980s she has been a regular participant in Solent Gaffer events, with a sprinkling of
   race trophies but, more importantly, a serious reputation as a party boat at gaffer and historic boat
   events on both sides of the Channel.

   She has a wealth of historical information and some early owners’ writings are classics of the genre.

   She is a comfortable and biddable boat; spacious for 2 and comfortable for 4, always a joy to sail.
