full_description: "<p>Nothing other than a name is known about her first owner but\
  \ much is written about the cruises of her second owner Henry Carson and his sister\
  \ Beryl. They bought the boat in 1911 and cruised her around the Solent and down\
  \ the West Country. In 1912 they sailed up to the Baltic to Copenhagen. The trip\
  \ is recorded in the CA Bulletin and an original log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 1913\
  \ they returned and sailed her up to Russia at Kronstadt before returning to Cowes\
  \ on September 23rd. They met Erskine Childers in Kalmar on July 29th. Both Carson\
  \ and Childers record the meeting in their logs. Carson won the CA&#39;s Love Cup\
  \ in 1912 and 1913 for their cruise and the RCC&#39;s Romola Cup in 1913. In October\
  \ 1919 they sailed from Cowes to Le Havre, taking the boat down the French Canals\
  \ to the Mediterranean arriving in January 1920. Carson then sailed the boat to\
  \ Sete and took her through the Canal du Midi to Bordeaux. From there in August\
  \ 1920 he and Beryl sailed the boat back to England. This trip is described in 6\
  \ Yachting Monthly articles published in 1921 and 1922. They sold the boat in January\
  \ 1922.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Carson she had three owners in quick succession but\
  \ in 1932 she was bought by Joseph Mew, a brewer on the Isle of Wight. He sailed\
  \ her in the early Round the Island Races. A Beken photograph survives from this\
  \ time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1939 she was sold and taken to the East Coast. In 1950\
  \ she was converted to Bermudan at Dan Web and Feesey, then bought by Edgar Traylen\
  \ in 1960. Whilst on the slip being fitted out she was recognised by Carson&#39;s\
  \ daughter and this is how her history came to light. Traylen kept her on the Walton\
  \ Backwaters for 20 years before selling her to Richard Barnard who converted her\
  \ back to a gaff cutter using the Bermudan mast. However the rig was not powerful\
  \ and the boat needed a good breeze to get her going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pat and Dick\
  \ Dawson bought her in 1983 and sailed her back to the South Coast. She leaked a\
  \ lot on this trip, resulting in a three year refit In 1989 the Dawsons replaced\
  \ the rig based on the dimensions of her original rig recorded in her 1911 log.\
  \ In their ownership she has cruised the south coast of England from Ramsgate to\
  \ the Helford river in Cornwall, across the Channel to Normandy, the Channel Islands\
  \ and the North Brittany coast.</p>"
