  for the Page brothers of West Mersea mainly for spratting.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Shamrock&#39; joined the Colchester Oyster Fishing fleet\
  \ and for many years was watch boat for the Mersea and Tollesbury Oyster Fishery\
  \ Co. Ltd. During the winter 1962/63 she was moored on the River Blackwater. On\
  \ a particularly cold night in January 1963 she was wrecked by ice borne in on the\
  \ tide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salvaged by Cecil Stebbins, she was rebuilt and converted\
  \ to a gaff cruising yacht by Brian K Thomas, 1967-71. When offered for sale in\
  \ the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter, 1980, by Tony James of Exmouth, Devon,\
  \ she was described as a &#39;classic smack conversion, maintained to highest standard,\
  \ based on the Exe&#39;:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Constant renewal and restoration\
  \ 1970/80. Over &pound;6,000 spent on maintenance and improvements since 1974, inc.\
  \ new 70 hp Ford diesel, new boom, bowsprit, running rigging. Excellent survey May\
  \ 1980. Refastened and recaulked 1970. Immaculate condition for her age. Fully equipped\
  \ for extansive cruising. Winner Class 1, 1980, South West Old Gaffers Race.</blockquote>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>She is known to have formed part of the Exeter Maritime Museum collection,\
  \ but in 1996 the Museum was closed and the collection dispersed. Around 2004, she\
  \ was seen at Southwold needing a major rebuild, she was also reported to have been\
  \ seen in a yard in Lowestoft around 2011, just opposite the International Boatbuilding\
  \ Training College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span data-ft=\"{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}\"\
  ><span class=\"UFICommentBody _1n4g\"><span><span>In 2016 her whereabouts were reported\
  \ as unknown via Facebook. Several people remained interested in her and posts confirmed&nbsp;</span></span></span><span\
  \ class=\"UFICommentBody\"><span>she was at Lowestoft Marina, having been there\
  \ &#39;for a few years!</span></span><span class=\"UFICommentBody _1n4g\"><span><span>&#39;\
  \ In March 2017, she was purchased and returned to within a few miles of Brightlingsea,\
  \ with the intention to undertake a full restoration.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\
