short_description: |-
  'Shamrock' was built at Brightlingsea, 1900, by Aldous for the Page brothers of
  West Mersea mainly for spratting.
full_description: |-
  'Shamrock' joined the Colchester Oyster Fishing fleet and for many years was
  watch boat for the Mersea and Tollesbury Oyster Fishery Co. Ltd. During the
  winter 1962/63 she was moored on the River Blackwater. On a particularly cold
  night in January 1963 she was wrecked by ice borne in on the tide.


  Salvaged by Cecil Stebbins, she was rebuilt and converted to a gaff cruising
  yacht by Brian K Thomas, 1967-71. When offered for sale in the Old Gaffers
  Association Newsletter, 1980, by Tony James of Exmouth, Devon, she was described
  as a 'classic smack conversion, maintained to highest standard, based on the
  Exe':



  > Constant renewal and restoration 1970/80. Over £6,000 spent on maintenance and improvements since 1974, inc. new 70 hp Ford diesel, new boom, bowsprit, running rigging. Excellent survey May 1980. Refastened and recaulked 1970. Immaculate condition for her age. Fully equipped for extansive cruising. Winner Class 1, 1980, South West Old Gaffers Race.


  She is known to have formed part of the Exeter Maritime Museum collection, but
  in 1996 the Museum was closed and the collection dispersed. Around 2004, she was
  seen at Southwold needing a major rebuild, she was also reported to have been
  seen in a yard in Lowestoft around 2011, just opposite the International
  Boatbuilding Training College.


  In 2016 her whereabouts were reported as unknown via Facebook. Several people
  remained interested in her and posts confirmed she was at Lowestoft Marina,
  having been there 'for a few years!' In March 2017, she was purchased and
  returned to within a few miles of Brightlingsea, with the intention to undertake
  a full restoration.


  She is listed on the [World of Boats website,
  Eyemouth](http://www.worldofboats.org/boats/view/tsw_shamrock/65/smack).


  Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to
  be in the 1970s, showing her win the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race from
  Gravesend to Billingsgate, skippered by architect Brian Thomas.
