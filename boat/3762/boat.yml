  Building began in the spring of 2010, the hull constructed within 6 months in a
  tent. Construction stopped with the collapse of the tent. Following the
  construction of a barn to replace the tent work crawled along for another 8
  years.

  *Acorn* was launched in 2019 from Harwich and dovercourt sailing club. She spent a
  year sailing from Brightlingsea before taking up residence at Shotley. From
  there we have sailed her south as far as Chatham (2020) and north as far as
  Amble, an ongoing adventure attempting to sail round England
