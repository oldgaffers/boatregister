full_description: "<p>The<em> </em>&#39;Deirdre&#39; (pronounced &#39;daredra&#39;)\
  \ was built in 1935 by Alexander Gostelow of Boston to a design by Dennis Jacobs.\
  \ Her hull was constructed from 1&frac14;in. American redwood on 3in. sawn oak frames\
  \ at 2&rsquo;6&rdquo; centres and 1&frac12;&rdquo;x 1&rdquo; steamed oak ribs at\
  \ 10&rdquo; centres. Her keelson and deadwood were elm. The foredeck was 1&frac14;&rdquo;\
  \ teak and the stern deck 1&frac14;&rdquo; pine. The long keel is &frac12; ton cast\
  \ iron and there are an additional 1&frac14; tons of cast iron and lead internal\
  \ ballast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Displacement, in cruising trim, is estimated at a little\
  \ over 4 tons. The pine mast is deck stepped in a tabernacle which extends to the\
  \ keel. The mast can be easily raised and lowered by one person using the sheer\
  \ pole and tackle. Standing rigging is galvanised steel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Refurbishment</h3>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Bought by Kit Platten in 1998, she has subsequently been restored to a\
  \ high standard and at considerable expense, with over &pound;25,000 spent on professional\
  \ assistance between 2011 - 2015. The cabin and cockpit have been completely rebuilt,\
  \ the stern deck sheathed with 6mm ply and 8mm teak caulked with Sikaflex and the\
  \ existing teak foredeck refastened with A4 stainless steel screws and re-caulked.\
  \ The engine was repositioned and she was given a new stainless steel stern tube\
  \ and prop shaft, bronze propeller and stern glands. She was sailing again in 2004\
  \ and has been extensively cruised along the East Coast during the summer whilst\
  \ the internal refurbishment continued during the winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011\
  \ she underwent a major structural overhaul which included burning off the hull,\
  \ raking out all seams, stripping out any rotten planking and drenching all exposed\
  \ timber with wood preservative. Frames were doubled with Iroko and ribs with steamed\
  \ oak. She was re-planked with 1&frac14;&rdquo; larch and completely refastened\
  \ with bronze screws or copper nails and roves. Seams were re-caulked with cotton\
  \ and red lead putty. The rudder was rebuilt, the keel bolts replaced and a new\
  \ galvanised steel stem band fitted. She also has a new bowsprit and boom gallows.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Jabsco Standard toilet with bronze skin\
  \ fittings is installed in the forepeak. There is ample racking for sail bags and\
  \ easy access to the chain locker with 30m of galvanised chain spliced to 30m of\
  \ 14mm anchorplait warp. The 20lb CQR bower anchor is stowed on the foredeck. There\
  \ is also a 15lb CQR kedge anchor with 30m of 12mm anchorplait. There is one bulkhead\
  \ mounted 12v lamp and wiring is in place for a second lamp if required. A &ldquo;modesty\
  \ curtain&rdquo; separates the forepeak from the saloon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comfortable\
  \ saloon extends the full width of the boat, has 5&rsquo;6&rdquo; headroom with\
  \ full standing headroom under the skylight and ample locker and shelf space. The\
  \ saloon table is demountable and can be stored against the forward bulkhead. There\
  \ are two bulkhead mounted 12v lamps and a 12v LED reading lamp at the head of the\
  \ starboard berth. The 4&rdquo; thick berth cushions were new in 2013 and have a\
  \ memory foam topping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spacious galley is fitted with a gimballed\
  \ Techimpex two burner gas cooker with oven (new in 2012) and there is a deep stainless\
  \ steel sink with bronze water pump and faucet fed from a 25litre container in the\
  \ forepeak. Additional water containers are stored under the saloon berths. Waste\
  \ water is discharged overboard by an electric pump. There is generous work top\
  \ space and plenty of drawers, lockers and shelves. There is a full set of china\
  \ and plastic crockery, polycarbonate glasses, stainless steel cutlery and galley\
  \ utensils as well as pots, pans, a pressure cooker, chopping boards, storage containers\
  \ etc. etc. A fluorescent lamp is mounted on the beam shelf above the cooker &nbsp;and\
  \ there is a 13a 220v twin socket for use when shore power is available. There is\
  \ even an electric kettle and toaster! The engine box acts as a useful seat when\
  \ working in the galley. A fire blanket is mounted adjacent to the sink and a fire\
  \ extinguisher on the port side of the companionway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The navigation\
  \ area has a large chart table with ample stowage for spare charts and pilot books.\
  \ The bulkhead between the table and the saloon is faced with cork pin board and\
  \ there is a useful bookshelf above. All instruments are within easy reach. There\
  \ is a fluorescent lamp fixed to the port beam shelf as well as a flexible chart\
  \ table lamp. A 13a 230v twin socket and 12v socket are mounted on the outboard\
  \ bulkhead. The navigator sits on the head of the quarter berth with ample knee\
  \ room under the chart table. Two 110 amp/hour sealed batteries are situated under\
  \ the navigator&rsquo;s seat. The switchboard is mounted on the face of a locker\
  \ fitted to the cockpit bulkhead with wiring easily accessible from inside the locker\
  \ that also contains the shore powered battery charger and a16a 230v CCU. The locker\
  \ has a separate space for the first aid kit, medicine box, spare fuses and torches\
  \ etc. All 12v wiring is marine grade and concealed within or behind bulkheads and\
  \ easily accessible via removable panels. There is a 220v ring main with twin socket\
  \ outlets in the navigation and galley areas with provision for a third socket in\
  \ the forward Saloon bulkhead if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ducati engine is easily\
  \ accessed via a removable cover that also acts as the companionway and as a useful\
  \ seat for the galley. The engine is extremely reliable, has always started first\
  \ time and, being air-cooled, is ideal for use in the shoal waters of the East Coast.\
  \ It has proved very economical and burns practically no oil. The fuel tank holds\
  \ 12 gallons (55 litres) and is housed under the stern deck accessible via a hatch.\
  \ Above the engine and under the bridge deck is a large locker for life jackets,\
  \ safety harnesses spare hats etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On Deck</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The cockpit\
  \ has a large locker with lift up lid to starboard with ample room for fuel cans,\
  \ engine accessories, fenders etc. There is a smaller locker with lift up lid to\
  \ port for mooring warps and 3 open fronted bins for furling ties, spare lines,\
  \ and drinks bottles. The stern coaming is drilled for tiller pegs and the fittings\
  \ for mounting the Autopilot are on the stern deck. There are two strong points\
  \ for attaching safety harnesses. The boom gallows are mounted on adjustable posts.\
  \ The upper position allows for full standing headroom under the boom and the lower\
  \ position is used for sailing. The cockpit is self-draining and there are removable\
  \ oak gratings and a hatch giving access to the engine fuel filter and further storage\
  \ space. The engine controls are recessed to avoid potential tangling with sheets.\
  \ The cockpit tent and mainsail cover were new in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;Deirdre&#39;\
  \ has been rigged for single handed sailing. All halyards and control lines for\
  \ the sails (except the topsail and potential spinnaker) lead aft to the cockpit\
  \ and there are &ldquo;on/off&rdquo; cleats for the sheets. There are no winches\
  \ fitted but the staysail and jibs have two part purchases and are easily controlled\
  \ even in strong winds (there are two pairs of winches available if wanted!). As\
  \ she is a &ldquo;classic boat&rdquo; there are no guardrails but permanent fore\
  \ and aft safety lines are rigged on the cabin top and the foredeck to which a safety\
  \ harness can be clipped.</p>"
