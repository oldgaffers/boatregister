full_description: "<p>Halewyn is a bermudan rigged&nbsp;centreboarder, her hull mahogany\
  \ and her deck and cockpit teak. She has 4 berths and comes with VHF and other crusing\
  \ equipment as well as a suit of sails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has been in the current\
  \ ownership since 1991. She underwent a 3 year rebuild at that time and was relaunched\
  \ in 1994. She&#39;s been a much-loved family cruising boat since then, participating\
  \ in gaffer rallies in the north of France,&nbsp;but sadly ill health and now the\
  \ sad passing of one owner means she must be sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&#39;s currently\
  \ in a yard in Calais but soon to be returned to her home port of Dunkerque.</p>"
