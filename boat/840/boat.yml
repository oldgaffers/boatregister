full_description: "<p>&#39;Stadats&#39; was built by S.E. Saunders of Cowes for the\
  \ RNLI in 1921, then named &#39;Frederick &amp; Emma&#39;,&nbsp;as a sailing lifeboat\

  \ in 1985 as a bare hull and he fitted her out with new deck and coachroof, engine,\

  \ yacht, cruising the East Coast rivers and taking part in traditional regattas\
  \ and OGA events.&nbsp;Never at the front of the fleet, she was always there no\
  \ matter what the weather.</p>"
