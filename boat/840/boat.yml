full_description: "<p>&#39;Stadats&#39; was built by S.E. Saunders of Cowes for the\
  \ RNLI in 1921, then named &#39;Frederick &amp; Emma&#39;,&nbsp;as a sailing lifeboat\
  \ with auxiliary power.&nbsp;She first served at the new lifeboat station in Wick\
  \ until 1939. She then went to Amble until 1952.&nbsp;During her service for the\
  \ RNLI she saved 98 lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was purchased by a professional shipwright\
  \ in 1985 as a bare hull and he fitted her out with new deck and coachroof, engine,\
  \ rig and interior fitout. For many years, she was used as a liveaboard and family\
  \ yacht, cruising the East Coast rivers and taking part in traditional regattas\
  \ and OGA events.&nbsp;Never at the front of the fleet, she was always there no\
  \ matter what the weather.</p>"
