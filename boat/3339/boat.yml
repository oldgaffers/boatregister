short_description: <p>'Verity' is an Oysterman 16 built in 1984, No. 15 in a series
  of boats built by Riverside Projects in Penryn.</p>
full_description: <p>The inboard engine was installed by the manufacturer and was
  ballasted to suit. In 2021 the boat had a furling headsail replaced with a Furlex
  5 capable of being furled and reefed more efficiently. However, as the forestay
  is part of the standing rigging, withdrawing the bowsprit in harbour is not an option.&nbsp;</p>
