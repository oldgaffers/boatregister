full_description: <p>The inboard engine was installed by the manufacturer and was
  ballasted to suit. In 2021 the boat had a furling headsail replaced with a Furlex
  5 capable of being furled and reefed more efficiently. However, as the forestay
  is part of the standing rigging, withdrawing the bowsprit in harbour is not an option.&nbsp;</p>
