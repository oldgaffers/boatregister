full_description: "<p>Pierce Eye was the seventh centreboard One Design built by Brooke\
  \ and Hall for the Walton &amp; Frinton Yacht Club. She was designed by Morgan Giles,\
  \ built in 1921 with sail no. 7 on white sails with an emerald green hull.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Pierce Eye was badly damaged over the years, and purchased jointly in the\
  \ 1980s, with the decision to build a replica from ballast keel up. Robin Williams\
  \ was given copies of the Morgan Giles drawings by John Hall, boatyard owner in\
  \ Walton-on-the-Naze. On the sad passing of co-owner, Les Bowen, Robin was bequeathed\
  \ mast, spars, some rigging and sails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sail has enabled us to\
  \ confirm the record in the Boat Register, curiously having the &#39;7&#39; in a\
  \ different and older fabric. The last One Design to be built was No.&#39;7&#39;\
  \ and on joining the OGA the boat was given boat no. 473, which became her new sail\
  \ number, we can only assume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rebuild is still underway at Robin&#39;s\
  \ workshop in Buckfastleigh, Devon, with her original ballast keel, bronze fittings\
  \ and spars (except the boom), based on the original drawings.</p>"
