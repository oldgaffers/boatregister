short_description: Built in 1898, Playmate was a 30' gaff cutter. Few wooden boats
  of her size last over 100 years and, probably the oldest boat still sailing in the
  Bristol Channel, she was broken up in 2010 after being declared 'unseaworthy'.
full_description: "<h3>Playmate&#39;s last cruise, by Viv Head (Bristol Channel Area)</h3>\r\
  \n\r\n<h4>First published in the Gaffers Log: March 2011</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Playmate\
  \ has graced the Bristol Channel for a number of years now, often to be seen nosing\
  \ out of Bristol or more latterly Portishead, early in the season. A gaff cutter\
  \ of a little over thirty feet, perhaps &lsquo;graced&rsquo; may be the wrong word,\
  \ but her unmistakable lines gave her a special charm that was all her own. Built\
  \ in Poole Harbour around 1898, she was originally an open fishing boat but was\
  \ commissioned as a yacht in 1908 when she acquired the name Playmate. In 1924 she\
  \ was decked and a cabin added and later still, in 1965, she had a doghouse fitted.\
  \ Her skipper, John Maxwell, has owned her for twenty-four years, nearly a quarter\
  \ of her life, initially sailing out of Gravesend. Then in 1989 Playmate arrived\
  \ in Bristol from where she twice sailed to Brittany. In 2001 John moved her to\
  \ Portishead when the new marina opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playmate was built every\
  \ inch as a working boat and she retained that character for the rest of her days;\
  \ there was never anything bright and shiny about her decks or down below! But then\
  \ perhaps the same could be said of her skipper&rsquo;s philosophy - if something\
  \ still works, even if it does need a little coaxing, why does it need replacing?\
  \ In many ways the boat and her skipper were made for each other - both have long,\
  \ traditional sailing backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2010 turned out to be a seminal\
  \ year for Playmate. In May there came a splendid early season cruise in company,\
  \ the story of which will be related in the June edition of Gaffers Log. The next\
  \ month Playmate made passage to Cardiff Bay for an OGA gathering. On the way, with\
  \ an inexperienced helmsman, she came rather too close to a starboard mark and gave\
  \ the stern a bit of a clout but temporary repairs saw her safely home. Then in\
  \ late summer came the Holms Race, starting at Portishead, sailing down channel\
  \ to pass between Flat Holm and Steep Holm and back with the tide. On the outward\
  \ leg, the lee decks were under and she started taking in water faster than it could\
  \ be pumped out. The water in the cabin became so deep that it got into the electrics\
  \ and the crew were unable to start the engine. A call for assistance went out and\
  \ Playmate was towed back into Portishead by the lifeboat where she was immediately\
  \ craned onto the hard. It was her last outing. Removal of soft planks revealed\
  \ rotten frames and ribs. Some of the remaining planks started to drop because the\
  \ screws simply pulled out of the frames. The deck beams were no longer securely\
  \ attached to the hull - obviously a major factor in why she was leaking and explained\
  \ why she was permanently damp down below. The surveyor declared her unseaworthy\
  \ and advised a minimum of &pound;20,000 of repair work to make her safe - more\
  \ than twice her value even as a seaworthy vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few wooden boats\
  \ of her size last over a hundred years without a lot of money being spent. For\
  \ many years repairs had been carried out by her skipper at little cost - sadly\
  \ her time had come, despite all the joy she had brought, there was little option\
  \ but for her to be broken up. A sad end indeed for what may have been the oldest\
  \ boat still sailing the Bristol Channel.</p>"
