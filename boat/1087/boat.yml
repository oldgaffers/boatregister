short_description: Built in 1898, Playmate was a 30' gaff cutter. Few wooden boats
  of her size last over 100 years and, probably the oldest boat still sailing in the
  Bristol Channel, she was broken up in 2010 after being declared 'unseaworthy'.
full_description: "<h3>Playmate&#39;s last cruise, by Viv Head (Bristol Channel Area)</h3>\r
  \n\r\n<h4>First published in the Gaffers Log: March 2011</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Playmate
  has graced the Bristol Channel for a number of years now, often to be seen nosing
  out of Bristol or more latterly Portishead, early in the season. A gaff cutter of
  a little over thirty feet, perhaps &lsquo;graced&rsquo; may be the wrong word, but
  her unmistakable lines gave her a special charm that was all her own. Built in Poole
  Harbour around 1898, she was originally an open fishing boat but was commissioned
  as a yacht in 1908 when she acquired the name Playmate. In 1924 she was decked and
  a cabin added and later still, in 1965, she had a doghouse fitted. Her skipper,
  John Maxwell, has owned her for twenty-four years, nearly a quarter of her life,
  initially sailing out of Gravesend. Then in 1989 Playmate arrived in Bristol from
  where she twice sailed to Brittany. In 2001 John moved her to Portishead when the
  new marina opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playmate was built every inch as a working boat
  and she retained that character for the rest of her days; there was never anything
  bright and shiny about her decks or down below! But then perhaps the same could
  be said of her skipper&rsquo;s philosophy - if something still works, even if it
  does need a little coaxing, why does it need replacing? In many ways the boat and
  her skipper were made for each other - both have long, traditional sailing backgrounds.</p>\r
  \n\r\n<p>2010 turned out to be a seminal year for Playmate. In May there came a
  splendid early season cruise in company, the story of which will be related in the
  June edition of Gaffers Log. The next month Playmate made passage to Cardiff Bay
  for an OGA gathering. On the way, with an inexperienced helmsman, she came rather
  too close to a starboard mark and gave the stern a bit of a clout but temporary
  repairs saw her safely home. Then in late summer came the Holms Race, starting at
  Portishead, sailing down channel to pass between Flat Holm and Steep Holm and back
  with the tide. On the outward leg, the lee decks were under and she started taking
  in water faster than it could be pumped out. The water in the cabin became so deep
  that it got into the electrics and the crew were unable to start the engine. A call
  for assistance went out and Playmate was towed back into Portishead by the lifeboat
  where she was immediately craned onto the hard. It was her last outing. Removal
  of soft planks revealed rotten frames and ribs. Some of the remaining planks started
  to drop because the screws simply pulled out of the frames. The deck beams were
  no longer securely attached to the hull - obviously a major factor in why she was
  leaking and explained why she was permanently damp down below. The surveyor declared
  her unseaworthy and advised a minimum of &pound;20,000 of repair work to make her
  safe - more than twice her value even as a seaworthy vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few wooden
  boats of her size last over a hundred years without a lot of money being spent.
  For many years repairs had been carried out by her skipper at little cost - sadly
  her time had come, despite all the joy she had brought, there was little option
  but for her to be broken up. A sad end indeed for what may have been the oldest
  boat still sailing the Bristol Channel.</p>"
