full_description: "2018 Sailed from Portland Dorset to Titchmarsh Marina, Walton on\
  \ the Naze in October  taking 5 days.\r\nFirst thing to fix was replace the Loo.\
  \ Managed to find a brand new unused Blake\u2019s Baby loo on eBay . It took 1 1/2\
  \ days to fit including new pipes. Also need to fit the new Blake\u2019s sea cocks\
  \ when ashore.\r\nAs it\u2019s cold aboard a new Eberspacher heater was next.\r\n\
  The engine has been the most problematic item so far to fix. As Rosie wasn\u2019\
  t use for 18 years condensation inside the engine caused all the valve seats to\
  \ corrode and lessen the compression ratios. So a full cylinder head rebuild later\
  \ and I think it should be ok.havent had the time yet to do a proper sea trial.\
  \ Have to wait until the new year now.\r\nBought new Chartplotter and have to fix\
  \ it in place. Thinking of using a TV swinging mount attached to the access door\
  \ frame as it\u2019s a large 12\u201D screen.\r\nNeed to fit an AIS transponder\
  \ but will wait a couple of months hoping technology moved on as would like it integrated\
  \ into the VHF radio with Splitter, GPS,AIS transponder,NMEA 2000. At the moment\
  \ it doesn\u2019t exist.\r\nJobs to do.\r\nMake the bowsprit swivel.\r\nMaybe lead\
  \ lines aft into cockpit\r\nFit fresh water tank and pipes \r\nFeathering prop"
