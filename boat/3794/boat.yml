short_description: |-
  1999 GRP version of a small work-boat built 1905.
full_description: |-
  **Benbow** was one of the first "Castletown One-Designs" built in a mould taken
  from a 1905 local yawl built at Port St.Mary, IOM. About a dozen of these were
  made from 1999, led by the late John Qualtrough Snr. All but two of these boats
  were gaff-rigged to sail and race in Castletown Bay - with the original mast
  height limited to be able to just float in and out of Castletown harbour under
  the footbridge at minimum depth. Benbow was re-built from March 2021,
  re-launched in its present form in April 2022. The rig is an old National 18'
  Proctor F-section mast and boom from about 1985 - a foot-shorter than the
  maximum N18 mast with a slightly longer boom than standard. The 1985 sails were
  replaced in 2025, using "Squib" material for the mainsail - at least the colour
  looks traditional! Doesn't go under that bridge any more, of course...It has
  turned out to be a great dayboat - stiff enough for full rig up to moderate airs
  with 300 kgs of ballast between the 90kg centreboard and 210kgs of lead under
  the sole. Far too heavy and old-fashioned to exceed its hull-speed but reefed,
  it's superb.
