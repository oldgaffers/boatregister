short_description: A blue two masted with a white top.  The plan is to turn it into
  a Gunter rig.
full_description: |-
  A 23ft schooner, Bermuda rigged.  The previous owner bought it from someone on
  Mull and took to Derby.  Sailed recently on lakes in the midlands.  No working
  electrics, no toilet in the toilet cupboard.  No kitchen or cooking equipment.
   Fitting with a clean slate. The intention is to Gunter rig it so that the masts
  can be stepped quickly and easily by one man, and can get under a lot of bridges
  by just dropping the yard.
