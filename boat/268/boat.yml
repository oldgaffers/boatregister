full_description: |-
  Deva is an ex Royal Mersea Rivers Class, built 1912 by Crossfield of Arnside.
  The Rivers Class were Crossfields smallest Nobbys fitted out as open racing
  boats for the 'Liverpool gentlemen'. The Rivers Class differed from the working
  boats only in details of rig. The boom was longer and the sails were of cotton as
  opposed to tarred canvas, and they were rigged as sloops instead of cutters.

  Several of the class were built, possibly as many as 30, all named after rivers,
  Mersea was the first (and the fastest) followed by Deva, Thames, Styx, Severn
  etc. The Class was active up to about 1935, when it was disbanded. Several of
  the Class went to join their working sisters in the pursuit of shrimps and
  prawns in Liverpool Bay and off North Wales. Others have ended up as Bermudan
  rigged sloops.

  Deva first appeared in Lloyds Register in 1914, owners NF Hall and JF Jellico.
  After the war she reappears belonging to Captain Bond, Liverpool and in 1926 was
  sold to the Earl of Derby. He lent her to the Royal Navy in the 1930s for the
  training of midshipmen on HMS Eaglet. From 1939 onwards, Deva was owned by 'mere
  commoners'.

  Much of her original structure survived for the best part of a century, probably
  due to regular maintenance and use. She has pitch pine planking on oak frames.

  Deva returned to racing for Tranmere Yacht Club in 1956. Her owner, Harry
  Williams of Rock Ferry, a shipwright, redecked her and added a cabin. Deva was
  very successful against modern competition. One of her more notable achievements
  was gaining third place in the local Isle of Man midnight race against a
  Nor`wester. Her owner locked his seasick crew below for 17 hours while he sailed
  the race single-handed, or so the locals say.

  Shortly after this, Mr. Williams sold Deva to Mr. Wainwright and she was sunk in
  the River Mersea by a dredger. After repairs, she was sailed in the Mersea and
  on the North Wales coast, then through the canals via Wigan and Boston to
  Richmond. Her passage from Liverpool to Boston in eight days appears to be
  fastest recorded.

  Since being in the south, Deva has had a jackyard topsail added, and many
  improvements have been made to her accommodation, In the 1970 OGA East Coast
  Race, she was the smallest of the five boats to complete the course, winning
  second prize in Class 2, and in 1971, she won the East Coast Old Gaffers Trophy,
  coming second overall to Four Sisters.

  Re-decked with raised topsides by one plank, she was sold in 2008 from the
  estate of Jon Wainwright.

  In 2019 Deva was purchased by an 18 year old boat builder who started to restore
  her with a view to sailing in 2020.
