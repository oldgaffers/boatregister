short_description: <p>Built between the wars, &#39;Ocean Pearl&#39; has a chequered
  history.</p>
full_description: "<p>Originally built as a motor fishing boat, &#39;Ocean Pearl&#39;\
  \ fished out of Peterhead for many years and finally left the trade in the 1960s.\
  \ Since then she has had a chequered history and in the 1980s was out of the water,\
  \ on her side at Staines Middlesex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She moved to Coombes Boatyard\
  \ in Bosham in 1997 and two years later was taken over by Nick Gates, after the\
  \ yard shut. He replaced a third of the planking, 30 frames and futtocks, stem,\
  \ apron, sternpost and keelson. He laid new decks and coachroof and rigged her for\
  \ the first time with a Manx Nobby rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her first sail was to the\
  \ 2007 Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival.</p>"
