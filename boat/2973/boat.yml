full_description: "<p>Margherita is a Shilling class yacht, built in 2008 by Phil\
  \ Swift of Willow Bay boats, who also designed her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 17ft\
  \ long hull is constructed of cedar strip on plywood frames, glassed over inside\
  \ and out. Fit out is done with marine ply, iroko and utile. Mast and spars are\
  \ douglas fir. She is immensely strong, fast and seaworthy for her size, but both\
  \ she and her skipper prefer flattish water and around a F3 wind to give maximum\
  \ pleasure. The shallow draft makes her ideal for creek crawling and anchoring away\
  \ from crowds. There is a 50kg steel centre plate and another 100kg of steel punchings\
  \ are contained in bespoke boxes either side of the centre box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimated\
  \ overall weight is 1650lb or 750kg ready to sail, and she tows easily behind a\
  \ VW Golf diesel. Sail area is 175 square feet or approx 16 square metres. The cabin\
  \ is smallish, but comfortable, with two aft-facing seats that transform into part\
  \ of the berths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a small meths stove and she can sleep two\
  \ in comfort, with the help of a cockpit tent for night stowage. She is perfect\
  \ for sailing single-handed, as all work apart from anchoring can be&nbsp;done from\
  \ the cockpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based in Poole, I have attended several OGA events\
  \ with her, including the 50th anniversary rally at Cowes in 2013, OGA 55 in 2018\
  \ and a number of other Solent events each year. Eight of these yachts currently\
  \ exist, as far as I am aware; five rigged as yawls, two as cutters and one open\
  \ dayboat variant as a sloop. Another yawl is in build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
