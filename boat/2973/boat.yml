  Margherita is a Shilling class yacht, built in 2008 by Willow Bay boats. The
  17ft hull is cedar strip on plywood frames and she is immensely strong, fast and
  seaworthy for her size. Based in Poole, she attends OGA events, including the
  50th anniversary rally at Cowes in 2013 and OGA55 in 2018.

  Margherita is a Shilling class yacht, built in 2008 by Phil Swift of Willow Bay
  boats, who also designed her. 


  The 17ft long hull is constructed of cedar strip on plywood frames, glassed over
  inside and out. Fit out is done with marine ply, iroko and utile. Mast and spars
  are douglas fir. She is immensely strong, fast and seaworthy for her size, but
  both she and her skipper prefer flattish water and around a F3 wind to give
  maximum pleasure. The shallow draft makes her ideal for creek crawling and
  anchoring away from crowds. There is a 50kg steel centre plate and another 100kg
  of steel punchings are contained in bespoke boxes either side of the centre box.


  Estimated overall weight is 1650lb or 750kg ready to sail, and she tows easily
  behind a VW Golf diesel. Sail area is 175 square feet or approx 16 square
  metres. The cabin is smallish, but comfortable, with two aft-facing seats that
  transform into part of the berths.


  There is a small meths stove and she can sleep two in comfort, with the help of
  a cockpit tent for night stowage. She is perfect for sailing single-handed, as
  all work apart from anchoring can be done from the cockpit.


  Based in Poole, I have attended several OGA events with her, including the 50th
  anniversary rally at Cowes in 2013, OGA 55 in 2018 and a number of other Solent
  events each year. Eight of these yachts currently exist, as far as I am aware;
  five rigged as yawls, two as cutters and one open dayboat variant as a sloop.
  Another yawl is in build.
