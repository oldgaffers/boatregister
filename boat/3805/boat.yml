  enclosed cabin.
full_description: |-
  Dora has been in my ownership for 10 years and was kept in France  and has taken
  part in the Semain du Golfe in Morbihan on a number of occasions. More recently
  she has been moored in Dartmouth. The original engine, an AC1W CUB has
  unfortunately died. Until a new engine is fitted an outboard motor is attached
  to a stern bracket. Her rig is unusual as the Heard boats are predominantly Gaff
  Rigged. I think the bow sprit was fitted by the last owner with its Wykeham and
  Martin Bronze furling gear. It makes for a very pretty boat.
