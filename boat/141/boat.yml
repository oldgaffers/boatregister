short_description: <p>Inspired by the Tahiti Ketch design, <em>Rawanah</em> was designed
  by Maurice Griffiths and built by Harry King at Pin Mill.</p>
full_description: '<p>The Tahiti Ketch was designed by Texan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Hanna">John
  Hanna</a> around 1928, but while Maurice Griffiths liked the concept he felt he
  could do better with it. The result was <em>Rawanah</em>, built by Harry King at
  Pin Mill, perhaps inspired by <em>Awara</em> also built there in 1932.</p>

  <p><em>Rawanah</em> &nbsp;was registered in &nbsp;Ipswich to Hubert Arnold Brown,
  a good friend of Maurice Griffiths, &nbsp;who had commissioned the build, and then
  the vessel passed to the Jersey Register on 3 November 1950 when she was bought
  by the Hollick brothers &nbsp;at St Lawrence, Jersey.</p>

  <p>She features in Maurice Griffiths'' book &nbsp;''Little Ships &amp; Shoal Waters''
  recounting a voyage he made, together &nbsp;with Hubert Brown, from Oban to East
  Tarbert. The book also contains &nbsp;line drawings and sail plan.&nbsp; She was
  in the ownership of one family for &nbsp;42 years.</p>

  <p>Between 2005&nbsp;and 2015, <em>Rawanah</em> sailed thousands of &nbsp;miles
  to the Outer and Inner Hebrides, Orkney and Faroe Isles, Scilly &nbsp;Isles, and
  Ireland three times including a circumnavigation in July 2008. &nbsp;She won the
  ''Cock o'' the Bristol Channel Race'' with courses of 80 and 50 &nbsp;miles competing
  against the Bristol Channel cutter fleet. In all those &nbsp;sea miles <em>Rawanah</em>
  proved herself to be a sea kindly, robust vessel, &nbsp;gentle on the helm, making
  good passage time and capable in rough &nbsp;weather.</p>

  <p><em>Rawanah</em> is currently undergoing restoration in Crinan Boatyard and will
  hopefully be afloat in 2022.</p>'
