  Inspired by the Tahiti Ketch design, *Rawanah* was designed by Maurice Griffiths
  and built by Harry King at Pin Mill.
full_description: |-
  The Tahiti Ketch was designed by Texan [John
  Hanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Hanna) around 1928, but while
  Maurice Griffiths liked the concept he felt he could do better with it. The
  result was *Rawanah*, built by Harry King at Pin Mill, perhaps inspired by
  *Awara* also built there in 1932.


  *Rawanah*  was registered in  Ipswich to Hubert Arnold Brown, a good friend of
  Maurice Griffiths,  who had commissioned the build, and then the vessel passed
  to the Jersey Register on 3 November 1950 when she was bought by the Hollick
  brothers  at St Lawrence, Jersey.


  She features in Maurice Griffiths' book  'Little Ships & Shoal Waters'
  recounting a voyage he made, together  with Hubert Brown, from Oban to East
  Tarbert. The book also contains  line drawings and sail plan.  She was in the
  ownership of one family for  42 years.


  Between 2005 and 2015, *Rawanah* sailed thousands of  miles to the Outer and
  Inner Hebrides, Orkney and Faroe Isles, Scilly  Isles, and Ireland three times
  including a circumnavigation in July 2008.  She won the 'Cock o' the Bristol
  Channel Race' with courses of 80 and 50  miles competing against the Bristol
  Channel cutter fleet. In all those  sea miles *Rawanah* proved herself to be a
  sea kindly, robust vessel,  gentle on the helm, making good passage time and
  capable in rough  weather.


  *Rawanah* is currently undergoing restoration in Crinan Boatyard and will
  hopefully be afloat in 2026.
