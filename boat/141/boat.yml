short_description: "Inspired by the Tahiti Ketch design, *Rawanah* was designed by
  Maurice Griffiths\nand built by Harry King at Pin Mill."
full_description: "The Tahiti Ketch was designed by Texan [John\nHanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Hanna)
  around 1928, but while\nMaurice Griffiths liked the concept he felt he could do
  better with it. The\nresult was *Rawanah*, built by Harry King at Pin Mill, perhaps
  inspired by\n*Awara* also built there in 1932.\n\n\n*Rawanah*  was registered in
   Ipswich to Hubert Arnold Brown, a good friend of\nMaurice Griffiths,  who had commissioned
  the build, and then the vessel passed\nto the Jersey Register on 3 November 1950
  when she was bought by the Hollick\nbrothers  at St Lawrence, Jersey.\n\n\nShe features
  in Maurice Griffiths' book  'Little Ships & Shoal Waters'\nrecounting a voyage he
  made, together  with Hubert Brown, from Oban to East\nTarbert. The book also contains
   line drawings and sail plan.  She was in the\nownership of one family for  42 years.\n
  \n\nBetween 2005 and 2015, *Rawanah* sailed thousands of  miles to the Outer and\n
  Inner Hebrides, Orkney and Faroe Isles, Scilly  Isles, and Ireland three times\n
  including a circumnavigation in July 2008.  She won the 'Cock o' the Bristol\nChannel
  Race' with courses of 80 and 50  miles competing against the Bristol\nChannel cutter
  fleet. In all those  sea miles *Rawanah* proved herself to be a\nsea kindly, robust
  vessel,  gentle on the helm, making good passage time and\ncapable in rough  weather.\n
  \n\n*Rawanah* is currently undergoing restoration in Crinan Boatyard and will\n
  hopefully be afloat in 2026."
