full_description: |-
  Colchester smack 'Sallie' was built in 1907 by Aldous of Brightlingsea for the
  Bowles family from Tollesbury. She was registered for oyster dredging and stow
  boating for sprats. She operated in the Thames Estuary until 1951 when her
  ownership passed to Peter Light, one of the last sailing bargemen. He operated
  'Sallie' as a charter boat before passing her on to the Sea Scouts.


  In 1974 the owner wrote to the OGA Newsletter to say he is forced to sell
  against his will because he could no longer do the work needed on the hull, she
  was lying in Whitby at the time where she remained as a hulk near the harbour
  wall until 1981.


  She returned to Essex with her owner in 1981 where she underwent an extensive
  restoration, remaining engineless and having traditional cotton sails. She was
  relaunched in 1989 and in 2000 she sailed to lâ€™Aberwrach, Brest and Douarnenez
  festivals.
