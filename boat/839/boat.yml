full_description: "<p>Colchester smack &#39;Sallie&#39; was built in 1907 by Aldous\
  \ of Brightlingsea for the Bowles family from Tollesbury. She was registered for\
  \ oyster dredging and stow boating for sprats. She operated in the Thames Estuary\
  \ until 1951 when her ownership passed to Peter Light, one of the last sailing bargemen.\
  \ He operated &#39;Sallie&#39; as a charter boat before passing her on to the Sea\
  \ Scouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1974 the owner wrote to the OGA Newsletter to say he\
  \ is forced to sell against his will because he could no longer do the work needed\
  \ on the hull, she was lying in Whitby at the time where she remained as a hulk\
  \ near the harbour wall until 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She returned to Essex with her\
  \ owner in 1981 where she underwent an extensive restoration, remaining engineless\
  \ and having traditional cotton sails. She was relaunched in 1989 and in 2000 she\
  \ sailed to l&rsquo;Aberwrach, Brest and Douarnenez festivals.</p>"
