full_description: |-
  *Indian Runner'*s first owner sailed her out of Poole and undertook a number of
  Channel crossings in the first ten years of her life.  In 2022 she moved to Port
  Hamble Marina, in the Solent.  She is entered for the OGA 60 Round Britain

  She has a lifting centreboard so is capable of entering shallow creeks and

  lifting bowsprit, and for the 2023 season is being fitted with a maroon
  sprayhood.
