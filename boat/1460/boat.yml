short_description: <p>&#39;Peerie Maa&#39;, built in C1930 is a Shetland utility boat,
  with original rig cotton sails by Jeckells of Lowestoft.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Peerie Maa&#39; had a sliding gunter with boom using a\
  \ spinnaker boom heel fitting in a brass track for the gaff. Sails dated by Jeckells\
  \ to be pre-1956. The repairs extant in the hull indicate that she may have been\
  \ built as a utility boat before being fitted out with a cut down Shetland model\
  \ racing rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&#39;s had a new suit of terylene sails, with new\
  \ luff groove gaff with ash jaws made, various repairs and refits returning original\
  \ Shetland practice. Also uses shorter mast and standing lug, boomless main.</p>"
