  Operation Dynamo, Evacuation of BEF from Dunkirk.</p><p>Whilst owned by Mr C.P.
  Mackenrot, who lived at Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex &#39;Papillon&#39; was commissioned
  for Operation Dynamo. She arrived for service at Dover on 30 May 1940 ready to go
  to Dunkirk, but her two 4 cylinder Morris petrol engines were &#39;defective&#39;.
  It was noted that she had 30 gallons of petrol, a full crew and a minor electrical
  fault. A fault with her condenser was repaired. She was then loaded with six spare
  tins of petrol and water. There was a minor hiccup in that her civilian crew consisting
  of Skipper E. Sommers Holmwood of Kingston by Sea, S.J Downes of Shoreham, B.Hawood
  of Brighton and Mr Griffiths of Peacehaven were uncertain of their conditions of
  service. &#39;Papillon&#39; eventually sailed for Dunkirk on 2 June and when she
  came back the next day, gave up her route order and had her fuel and oil tanks replenished.</p><p>1940
