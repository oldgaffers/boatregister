full_description: "<p>&#39;Plugger&#39; was originally gunter rigged with Bermudan\
  \ mizzen (sails in use 2008 were from a Plymouth sailmaker of the 1960s), then converted\
  \ to gaff sloop rig of main with topsail and with a roach batterned mizzen all by\
  \ RS Hanniford of Cleveland 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was probably originally a Navy\
  \ pattern hull from the 1920s, although there was no name plate or markings found\
  \ during restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At an early stage the boat was fitted with a\
  \ centrifugal clutch Stuart Turner inboard 4HP petrol engine. The motor converted\
  \ by Stuart Turner with sailing gearbox, originally built before 1938. We know this\
  \ as Stuart Turner have records for the engine being modified in 1953, when a reverse\
  \ gearbox was fitted during a refit at Mashford&#39;s Yard, Crymll.</p>\r\n\r\n\
  <p>The engine was restored to working order in 2009 during her restoration to sailing\
  \ condition. &#39;Plugger&#39; was redecked in July 2015.</p>"
