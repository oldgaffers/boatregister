short_description: <p>&#39;Plugger&#39; is a 17&#39; 6&quot; quarter decked clinker
  mahogany on oak dayboat from the 1920s.</p>
full_description: "<p>&#39;Plugger&#39; was originally gunter rigged with Bermudan
  mizzen (sails in use 2008 were from a Plymouth sailmaker of the 1960s), then converted
  to gaff sloop rig of main with topsail and with a roach batterned mizzen all by
  RS Hanniford of Cleveland 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was probably originally a Navy
  pattern hull from the 1920s, although there was no name plate or markings found
  during restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At an early stage the boat was fitted with a centrifugal
  clutch Stuart Turner inboard 4HP petrol engine. The motor converted by Stuart Turner
  with sailing gearbox, originally built before 1938. We know this as Stuart Turner
  have records for the engine being modified in 1953, when a reverse gearbox was fitted
  during a refit at Mashford&#39;s Yard, Crymll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine was restored
  to working order in 2009 during her restoration to sailing condition. &#39;Plugger&#39;
  was redecked in July 2015.</p>"
