  Found semi-derelict in Newlyn in 1980 *Andorra* was recreated as a Mevagissy
  Lugger by Edwin Gifford
full_description: |-
  Edwin Gifford rescued *Andorra* from Newlyn Harbour as a  near derelict in 1980.
  She had been stripped out many times and  modified for power fishing. (fishing
  number PZ288) There were no sails,  or indicators of mast partners left. Verbal
  history said she was a  Mevagissy Tosher, but she is very big for the class. Her
  sharp forefoot  has many similarities to a Mevagissy Lugger model in the science
  museum,  so Edwin decided to rig her as a two masted lugger, although he thought
   she might have originally been a cutter. He also hypothesized that she  might
  have been built at as a racing yacht rather than a fishing boat,  as she is
  lightly built, and copper rather than iron fastenened.


  She  was built pre-motor days as the prop shaft is set to one side as the  stern
  post as an afterthought. Her dates are not known, but she may have built around
  1880.


  Arround 2012 she had deteriorated once again, leading to a total rebuild between
  2015 and 2022 including replacing aft section of keel, sternpost, transom, all
  ribs, new floors, beam shelf, approx. 70% of planking, deck and bulwarks. All
  timber used grown in Devon or is recycled. Installed 6kW Waterworld  electric
  motor to a shaft drive through the port quarter.


  Launched unrigged October 2022.


  Previous owner had replaced Edwin Gifford’s Mevagissey Lugger rig with a dipping
  lug which has been retained.


  Rebuild completed whilst afloat over winter 2022 and now sailing again.
