short_description: <p>Thought to have been built in Essex, 1954, it is not known where
  or by whom. After being salvaged in 1998 she was bought by Tim Frearson who undertook
  a major refit, converted her to a gaff cutter and re-launched her in 2004.</p>
full_description: "<p>She spent quite a few years sailing out of the Rye/Sandwich\
  \ area where Kevin Dillon-White bought her, probably from a P Guilor who had sold\
  \ her to buy a bigger boat to go travelling, unfortunately taking Katrina&#39;s\
  \ log book and documentation with him. Kevin Dillon-White later moved the boat to\
  \ Poole where she has remained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1998, she sank, was salvaged\
  \ and taken to Mitchell&#39;s Boatyard where Pierre Caestracaen aquired her. He\
  \ did some work and put her back afloat with an outboard and no inboard engine.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Tim Frearson bought her in 2000 and sailed her for the season with a rig\
  \ that barely worked. At this stage she was a gunter sloop with bright blue sails,\
  \ a Seagull Century outboard hanging off the back, a leaky deck and lots of pink\
  \ paint down below. Tim took her home and rebolted the stem and stern, tightened\
  \ all necessary fastenings and recaulked the hull. He took the cabin top off, replaced\
  \ the carlin and refitted her beams and planking, sheathing the foredeck, cabin\
  \ roof and afterdeck with epoxy glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also replaced the covering\
  \ boards, quadrants, forward toerails, forehatch, Samson post and bitts, rudder,\
  \ mainhatch, companionway doors and handrails. She had a new cockpit and was re-engined\
  \ with a 1968 Stuart Turner (same as her previous inboard engine) when he replaced\
  \ the interior to a new design.</p>"
