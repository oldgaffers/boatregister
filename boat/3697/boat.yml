short_description: <p>Cyrus V is a fold-up dinghy built by Seahopper Ltd. She is new
  as at January 2022, and has yet to be sailed as a change in circumstances has precluded
  this. She will make a fine, storable tender for a cruiing boat. When not in use
  she is stored in purpose built shower proof bags. She was intended for sailing on
  inland waters or estuaries.</p>
