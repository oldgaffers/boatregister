full_description: "<p>Built for Tom Adams, to race as well as fish. She was slow to\
  \ start but when tuned up won the King George V cup and came second behind &#39;Guess\
  \ Who&#39; another year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Servabo&#39; fished 9-10 years and was\
  \ then converted to a yacht and went to Ireland. She was strained on the way back,\
  \ with only one man on watch she could not reef. Following repair, she was chartered\
  \ out of Plymouth after the Second World War then taken to Scotland. Her owner was\
  \ drowned and she was left for a few years before being taken&nbsp;to the Solent.\
  \ She was once again chartered in the 1960&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999 &#39;Servabo&#39;\
  \ was reported as still sailing in the Caribbean.</p>"
