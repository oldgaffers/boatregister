  sales_text: "<p>Pilot Cutter P20 \u201CFrances Webber\u201D was originally named\
    \ \u201CAlice Pellow\u201D after the first owner\u2019s grandmother.</p><p>The\
    \ gaff rigged cutter has a full suite of sails including topsail on jack staff\
    \ and a flying jib as well as the standard cutter rig. A modern cruising chute\
    \ is also available.<p><p> Although looking like a gaff rigged classic the hull\
    \ is a very solid GRP moulding with flexiteek deck . The wooden mast, spars and\
    \ steving bowsprit complete the look of a modern classic. Indeed, when fitting\
    \ out, Alice Pellow featured in \u201CClassic Boat\u201D magazine . A lifting\
    \ keel reduces draft from about 1.6meters to just over a meter and the vessel\
    \ is fitted with mounting points for substantial wooden beaching legs (included).</p>\
    \ <p>Frances Webber benefits from a host of modern upgrades over the last few\
    \ years including: <ul>  <li>a new Yanmar 3YM30hp engine (2016)</li> <li>new mast\
    \ and spray hood (2014)</li> <li>new prop shaft and seals (2017)</li> <li>Raymarine\
    \ autopilot and other instrumentation (2015-2021)</li> <li>new headlining &amp;\
    \ LED lighting throughout (2021)</li> <li>professional mains electric installation\
    \ (2019)</li> <li>new gas hob/oven and professional gas pipework installation\
    \ (2018)</li> <li>new standing rigging (2021)</li> <li>refurbished Jabsco heads\
    \ (2019)</li> <li>new 150L flexi water tank and pressurised cold water system\
    \ (2020)</li> <li>Standard Horizon VHF with AIS and deck mounted remote handset.</li>\
    \ </ul> <p>Frances Webber adopts the roomier layout below of having two very large\
    \ quarter berths aft with airy heads forward allowing a longer saloon than the\
    \ alternative forward \u201CA berth\u201D layout.</p> <p>For reluctant sale due\
    \ to family illness</p>"
