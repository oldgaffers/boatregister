full_description: "<p>&#39;Frances Webber&#39;, formerley &#39;Alice Pellow&#39;,\
  \ is a Cornish Crabber Pilot cutter 30, a well built, traditionally styled family\
  \ cruiser with plenty of space below deck and enjoyable well-mannered performance.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>These pretty boats attract attention wherever they go and have excellent\
  \ windward ability. The lifting keel is ideal for coastal cruising. &#39;Alice&#39;\
  \ was re-fitted in 2014 and sails regularly with the OGA, she changed hands in 2019\
  \ when her name was changed to &#39;Frances Webber&#39;.</p>"
