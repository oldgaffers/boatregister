full_description: "<p>&#39;Sea Pig&#39; is an Everson Cherub built on the River Deben\
  \ at Woodbridge, Suffolk in 1930. One of the few boats to have entered all the OGA\
  \ East Coast Races since 1963, she was winner of the Cup for Trying in 1967 and\
  \ the pedal prize in 1968 when she led the outgoing fleet for some time.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>In earlier races she sailed under the number CC19 but in 1964 when sailed\
  \ to the Deben it was discovered that only 18 Cherubs had been built and &#39;Sea\
  \ Pig&#39; was actually CC4. An extra suit of sails had been cut, but no hull built.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>In the summer of 1939, when owned by Surgeon Commander Curjel of Woodbridge,\
  \ she cruised to Portsmouth, but on her return was caught by the onset of war and\
  \ laid up at Dover where she was damaged by enemy shells. Refitted after the war\
  \ and bought by Mr. Titheridge in 1948, she was sailed extensively in home waters\
  \ during pub closing hours and occasionally as far as the Isle of Wight.</p>\r\n\
  \r\n<p>Winner of the OGA Seamanship Cup in 1969 and 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was\
  \ lying in Heybridge Basin for several years, in need of someone to complete her\
  \ restoration and in 2017, she was taken on by Thomas Morley and moved to Devon.&nbsp;</p>"
