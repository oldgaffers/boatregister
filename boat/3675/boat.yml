    *Knot a Clew* (*Knotty* for short) is a Mevagissey Tosher 18 which I bought
    second-hand from Gaffers & Luggers in Mylor Bridge Cornwall in 2011. Having
    sailed on Falmouth working boats I think of her as a smaller cousin. Recently
    *Knotty* has undergone some quite extensive renovations below waterline. Hull
    stripped down to gelcoat; Keel reinforced with an 8” epoxy GRP wrap around then
    epoxy coatings/antifoul applied. Internally, the old Cornish concrete was
    removed, the hull reinforced with polyester resin GRP and chrome steel punchings
    added. A new plywood floor has been built (similar to *Ariel of Greystones* –
    see their website for info). New Plywood bulkheads and a new plywood /hardwood
    deck in work but needs completion (The level of the deck has been raised with a
    false bulwark). Unfortunately, a change in circumstances forces her sale but
    this would be an ideal winter project for someone. She is currently lying on a
    marina berth in Sovereign Harbour in Eastbourne with a temporary watertight
    cover.  *Knotty*’s hull is on sale for the princely sum of £1. She can also be
    bought with a cruising gaff rig with bowsprit and topsail, a 6hp Tohatsu sail
    drive outboard with very low hours and a selection of hardwood sufficient to
    complete the new deck. All of these are negotiable on price.
