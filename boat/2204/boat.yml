short_description: <p><em>Annabel J </em>has been described as a replica Bristol pilot
  cutter, but new materials have been used where appropriate combining performance
  of the renowned pilot cutters with a fine modern vessel.</p>
full_description: "<p><em>Annabel J's</em> design is based on the renowned surviving
  Bristol pilot cutter, Marguerite T, built by Edwin Rowles at Pill, 1893 for pilot
  Frank Trott.</p>\n<p>Plans for <em>Annabel J</em> were drawn up by marine architect
  David Cox and completed by Gary Mitchell of Duchy Boatyard Services, with engineering
  details by Phil Hughes. Gary Mitchell also designed the interior. A &amp; P Appledore
  of Falmouth secured the contract to construct the 54' (16.4m) hull, the first complete
  hull to be constructed in Falmouth Docks since 1930, and Harry Spencer was chosen
  to make the mast and rigging.</p>\n<p>'Annabel J' took part in the 2013 OGA Round
  Britain Challenge as part of her annual programme of sailing holidays..</p>"
