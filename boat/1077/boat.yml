    19’ Memory, modified to a yawl rig with twin headsails and topsail.  One of the
    early (c 1980) Liverpool boats of Tony Robinson design.  The wooden mast and
    spars are well varnished and the wooden blocks and tackle are all in keeping
    with her heritage.  
    **She is a perfect, single handed, traditional day boat with a surprising turn
    of speed, particularly with all five sails set.** The small cuddly provides
    ‘Spartan’ twin births, which works well with the boom tent for any adventurous
    campers.  
    The ancient Yanmar PMX6 inboard diesel is scruffy, but very reliable.  Its
    electric start is off twin batteries with solar charging.  The main and both
    headsails have recently been replaced. The mizzen sail is functional, but needs
    attention.  She is equipped with a recent sail cover, tourneau cockpit cover and
    boom tent.  She is generally in sound condition bwould benefit from attention to
    the hull paintwork and needs anti fouling, but otherwise a very pretty boat,
    much admired in her home port of Torquay. (Town Dock)  
    She is equipped with depth gauge/fish finder, a small Garmin gps and a new
    automatic tiller pilot.  Safety gear includes main anchor with chain and stern
    anchor, along with inflatable dingy with electrical air pump.
