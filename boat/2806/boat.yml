  \n\r\n<blockquote>Where do the years go? My reality check came when I realised I\
  \ was in my early sixties; our daughters were grown up, and worse, my 1850&rsquo;s,\
  \ Noman&rsquo;s Land Boat, built on Galiano Island BC, in 1978 was approaching almost\
  \ 30 years old.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nDuring the previous 29 years I had worked,\
  \ brought up a family and fitted the boat with three engines. The first was a new\
  \ 1976 British Seagull Silver Century, side mounted aft of the mizzen mast. The\
  \ engine was adequate, although it produced slightly less than the required horse\
  \ power needed to attain the boat&rsquo;s hull speed. This problem was accentuated\
  \ by a side mount, a manufactured one size fits all, bracket which added to the\
  \ loss of horsepower. That engine was later reworked and converted into an inboard,\
  \ but the lack of horsepower remained an irritating problem, and one I lived with\
  \ for several years.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nAbout 1985, I was enthusiastically\
  \ restoring several antique farm tractors; nothing like 500 (plus) cubic inch, two\
  \ cylinder, John Deer engines to make one realize there really is a God internal\
  \ combustion! This restoration work took me to a number of antique equipment shows\
  \ and swap meets throughout the Pacific Northwest.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\n\
  On one of these excursions I picked up three 1947 Briggs &amp; Stratton marine engines\
  \ for $75.00 and over several months was able to produce one fine engine with an\
  \ almost unlimited number of spare parts. This was a heavy cast iron engine and\
  \ once fitted in Northern Star&rsquo;s aft, left very little room for anything else.\
  \ It was a beautiful engine that included a water pump operating through a belt\
  \ drive to keep the water cooled exhaust,at operating temperature. Although the\
  \ engine&rsquo;s five horse power was ideal for maintaining the boat&rsquo;s hull\
  \ speed I lived in fear of a mechanical problem with the pump and the cries of &ldquo;Fire\
  \ Down Below&rdquo; from the crew.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nI decided it was\
  \ again time to change engines and opted for another British Seagull, but one with\
  \ enough horse power to drive the boat at hull speed. After numerous email enquiries\
  \ and phone calls, I bought one from West Coast Contractors of San Francisco California.\
  \ The company has a good reputation and in business for decades. By late November\
  \ I received my new 1973 British Seagull, Silver Century Plus WSPCL.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\
  \nAlthough the engine had been tested by Sean, the owner of West Coast Contractors\
  \ and I was assured it was in excellent condition, I&rsquo;d already decided that\
  \ Northern Star was going to be completely refitted and would be a wooden boat festival\
  \ winning classic boat. This meant that the engine also had to look like a piece\
  \ of sculpture, and by late December 2006 I started in earnest on the engine&rsquo;s\
  \ complete restoration.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nUnder all that dirt, paint and\
  \ grime British Seagull actually did have some fine castings, which is particularly\
  \ true of the Amal carburetor, if one takes the time to polish it. Over the next\
  \ few weeks the engine was completely stripped, cleaned, polished, machined, painted\
  \ and re-assembled. All painted parts were airbrushed with three coats of primer\
  \ and five coats of High Gloss Engine Enamel from Bill Hirsch Automotive, Newark\
  \ NJ USA. Incidentally, although not cheap these are the finest automotive paints\
  \ I&rsquo;ve ever used and are extremely resistant to heat, gasoline and oil. All\
  \ paint was applied using a professional quality Paasche air brush attached to a\
  \ DeWalt compressor fitted with in line air filters and water trap.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\
  \nAll machining was carried out on a Myford Super Seven lathe and a small bench\
  \ top milling machine. All parts cleaned sanded and then painted with three coats\
  \ of primer each wet sanded between coats and five coats of enamel. The Amal carburetor\
  \ was polished, cleaned internally and refitted with 24: 1 jets replacing the original\
  \ 10:1 mixture jets. Anyone that&rsquo;s operated a Seagull in a following wind\
  \ will understand my reasons for this conversion.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nThe\
  \ engine&rsquo;s restoration was scheduled to take several days, but like most hobbyist,\
  \ my time is of little value, and by the time it was finished so was most of February;\
  \ I was already concerned the boat would not be ready for summer!</blockquote><blockquote>\r\
  \n<h3>Refitting the boat</h3>\r\nThe first job was to remove all pitch from the\
  \ between the deck planks. Northern Star&rsquo;s deck is made of 184 pieces, a veritable\
  \ wood puzzle! There was no way around it, and was a job that required the mind\
  \ turned off, the radio turned on and go to it with a putty knife for the next few\
  \ weeks.<br />\r\nNext the hull was completely stripped of years of paint, sanded\
  \ and prepared for her new finish. While this was going on my oldest granddaughter\
  \ Anysha, Northern Star&rsquo;s next Master, spent days inside the hull and under\
  \ the fore and aft decks, sanding, scraping, oiling and varnishing.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\
  \nThe iron wood center board was removed and inspected and new anti fouling paint\
  \ was applied to the inside of the casing and the center board before reinstallation.\
  \ While working on the hull I also built a larger rudder with about a 20% more below\
  \ waterline surface area. I also built a custom made engine side mount for the Seagull\
  \ engine from Ironwood.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nWhile all this was going on,\
  \ I decided it was time to replace the now rather baggy canvas sails with new sails\
  \ made of more modern materials. Finally I made new brass nameplates to be fitted\
  \ port and starboard of the hull.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\n<h3>Specifications\
  \ of paints and varnishes used on hull and spars</h3>\r\nHull exterior (above water\
  \ line) - 5 coats of primer; seven coats of enamel, sanded between coats final sanding\
  \ to 400 grit before final enamel applied.<br />\r\nHull exterior (below water line)\
  \ 3 coats of anti fouling paint Interior of hull five coats of spar varnish wet\
  \ sanded to 600 grit; other areas oiled.<br />\r\nDeck &ndash; machine sanded to\
  \ 400 grit; hand sanded to 600 grit; Finish 3 coats of Brazilian Rose Oil Main &amp;\
  \ Mizzen masts, yards and tiller. &ndash; 2 coats of pre varnish; 17 coats of high\
  \ gloss varnish wet sanded to 600 grit between coats. Final coat wet sanded (progressively)\
  \ to 1000 grit.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nDue to several setbacks while I carried\
  \ out the work it was late summer before the job was completed and unfortunately\
  \ a summer&rsquo;s sailing was lost. However Northern star is now one of the finest\
  \ and most beautiful classics sailing the Pacific Northwest and a boat that is constantly\
  \ admired and photographed when she is under sail.</blockquote>"
