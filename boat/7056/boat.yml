short_description: Nancy Blackett was built in 1931 by Hillyards of Littlehampton.
  Between 1934 and 1938 she was owned by the children's author, Arthur Ransome. She
  inspired his book 'We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea', in which she is featured as the
  'Goblin'. She also appears in its sequel 'Secret Water'. She is now owned by the
  Nancy Blackett Trust.
full_description: "<p>In the 1980s Nancy Blackett was discovered in a derelict condition\
  \ by Michael Rines, who bought and restored her, relaunching her in 1990. He subsequently\
  \ sold her and when she came up for sale again in 1996, an appeal was launched to\
  \ buy her and secure her preservation. This was successful, and she was bought by\
  \ the newly-formed Nancy Blackett Trust in 1997. She is now regularly sailed by\
  \ members of the Trust on the East Coast, where she is based on the River Orwell\
  \ near Pin Mill, as well as further afield, including - of course - to Holland.</p>\r\
