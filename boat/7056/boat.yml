full_description: "<p>In the 1980s Nancy Blackett was discovered in a derelict condition\
  \ by Michael Rines, who bought and restored her, relaunching her in 1990. He subsequently\
  \ sold her and when she came up for sale again in 1996, an appeal was launched to\
  \ buy her and secure her preservation. This was successful, and she was bought by\
  \ the newly-formed Nancy Blackett Trust in 1997. She is now regularly sailed by\
  \ members of the Trust on the East Coast, where she is based on the River Orwell\
  \ near Pin Mill, as well as further afield, including - of course - to Holland.</p>\r\
