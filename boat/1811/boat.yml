full_description: <h3>Article by Danielle Hicks<br />first published in Gaffers Log,
  December 2007</h3><blockquote>My Granddad had sailed on many boats in his time,
  from Thames Barges to Drascombe Luggers (although we knew them as &lsquo;Drastic
  B*ggers&rsquo;) but had always had a yen to build his own. The design appealed to
  him greatly as he was a huge fan of the Schooner rig, but also because of her size,
  he saw in &lsquo;Ceol Mara&rsquo; a miniature ship of the line and himself one of
  Nelson's captains!</blockquote><blockquote>Anyone who has taken a look at how he
  had rigged her out will back this up - along with the idea that he was the founder
  member of the difficulties club!</blockquote><blockquote>So when Ceol-Mara passed
  to me last year, I was a little bit daunted at the task ahead of me. As she had
  not been sailed for a couple of years, and perhaps not been stowed away in the best
  of order, we had quite a job on our hands to work out what every different rope
  was for! There are a few that I have shown to various members of NIOGA, all of whom
  have looked suitably bewildered. However, it has to be said that if you like lots
  of things to fiddle with, she is the perfect partner!</blockquote><blockquote>My
  co-skipper, Mandy, is one such type of person, and in a way, although she had hardly
  sailed before the season just gone, she is now the better sailor, and understands
  &lsquo;Ceol Mara&rsquo; better than I do, not that I like to admit that.</blockquote><blockquote>If
  Granddad was the founding member of the difficulties club, then we can claim to
  certainly be leading lights in the comedy club. We also acquired an Osprey Seagull
  engine to go with &lsquo;Ceol Mara&rsquo;. Now, I can hear lots of you saying &quot;oh
  yes, good old seagull, reliable things they are.&quot; Any other Seagull is, I'm
  sure. This one was reliable in one way, every time we left the harbour, it stopped.
  We have been towed to Carrickfergus, towed away from Victoria Channel (shipping
  line), towed back into Bangor behind &lsquo;Vilma&rsquo; and a host of Pirates .
  . .That engine has been taken apart in every way except with a hammer,&nbsp; and
  that's what it's waiting for now, unless anybody wants a pet project?</blockquote><blockquote>Our
  other comedic act has been to create a rather amazing (if I do say so myself) 'boom
  tent' for &lsquo;Ceol Mara&rsquo;. Constructed out of an old green canvas tent (the
  Swallows and Amazons kind) it sits across the mizzen gaff (we don't have a miz boom)
  laid horizontal, then passes around the main to lay across the main boom and gaff,
  brought down on each side and tightened suitable, and we even kept the original
  zip, so we have a proper tent entrance at the stern. There is just room for two
  people to squeeze in down on the deck and sleep almost comfortably. We have, at
  Carrick, over the weekend and on at least one other occasion.</blockquote>

short_description: <p>'Coel Mara', or in English Sound of the Sea was built by my
  Grandfather, Michael Hicks, in 1993/4. She was designed by George Buehler, an American,
  under the class name 'The Happy Camper of Pogo Pogo' at all of 16.75 feet. We have
  wondered if she might not be the smallest schooner afloat!</p>
