  Originally called *The Wave*, Peggy is a Bristol Channel
  Pilot Cutter, built for pilot Arthur Case at Pill in 1903 by Edwin Rowles. Convered

  in the 1970s and 1980s by the Pridie family.

  *Peggy* was built for the Bristol Channel pilot Arthur Case in 1903 at Pill.
  Tragically, he was drowned several years later when boarding a ship off Nash
  Point. *Peggy* then became a Cardiff boat, later moving to Newport.
  
  She was converted to a yacht at Moodys at Swanwick in the 1920s. By the 1960s
  she was in poor condition and Alan Savage carried out extensive work, including
  replanking the topsides. When the Pridie family bought her the bottom leaked
  like a sieve, the decks were in a poor state and the mast needed serious attention.
  The Pridie family enjoyed several years of sailing, patching the bottom as necessary.
  Originally the hull had been bronze fastened but a previous owner had replaced
  some planks with ungalvanised nails which caused a reaction with the bronze.
  
  On a return trip from the Scilly Islands a friend mistook a Channel buoy for something
  else and the subsequent collision broke the bowsprit, split the stem and the topmast
  came down. They kept the boat afloat for six hours before being towed into Padstow by
  the lifeboat. Here they met a shipwright, Nimrod Bawden, who fitted a new stem and replaced
  the planking surrounding it.
  
  The Pridies decided to replank the bottom and by 1981 a fair bit had been replaced.
  *Peggy* competed in the OGA Race at Dartmouth but on the return to Bristol disaster hit
  again when they sat on a pile and punched a hole in the hull. She was salvaged and it was
  realised that *Peggy* needed a major refit.
  
  The boat was replanked and the deck beams replaced. In 1985 she was refloated and the
  following winter the deck was replanked. Much of the deck furniture had been salvaged
  and reused. A new hollow Noble mast and spars were added with new sails.
  
  Originally *Peggy* would not have had an engine, however she had acquired one of of
  dubious age and this was replaced with a similar one that had been a stand by generator.
  It was marinised together with a second hand gearbox. She was back sailing in 1986.
