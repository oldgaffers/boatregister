full_description: |-
  *Peggy* was built for the Bristol Channel pilot Arthur Case in 1903 at Pill.
  Tragically, he was drowned several years later when boarding a ship off Nash
  Point. *Peggy* then became a Cardiff boat, later moving to Newport.

   She was converted to a yacht at Moodys at Swanwick in the 1920s. By the 1960s
  she was in poor condition and Alan Savage carried out extensive work, including
  replanking the topsides. When the Pridie family bought her the bottom leaked
  like a sieve, the decks were in a poor state and the mast needed serious
  attention. The Pridie family enjoyed several years of sailing, patching the
  bottom as necessary. Originally the hull had been bronze fastened but a previous
  owner had replaced some planks with ungalvanised nails which caused a reaction
  with the bronze.

   On a return trip from the Scilly Islands a friend mistook a Channel buoy for
  something else and the subsequent collision broke the bowsprit, split the stem
  and the topmast came down. They kept the boat afloat for six hours before being
  towed into Padstow by the lifeboat. Here they met a shipwright, Nimrod Bawden,
  who fitted a new stem and replaced the planking surrounding it.

   The Pridies decided to replank the bottom and by 1981 a fair bit had been
  replaced. *Peggy* competed in the OGA Race at Dartmouth but on the return to
  Bristol disaster hit again when they sat on a pile and punched a hole in the
  hull. She was salvaged and it was realised that *Peggy* needed a major refit.

   The boat was replanked and the deck beams replaced. In 1985 she was refloated
  and the following winter the deck was replanked. Much of the deck furniture had
  been salvaged and reused. A new hollow Noble mast and spars were added with new
  sails.

   Originally *Peggy* would not have had an engine, however she had acquired one of
  of dubious age and this was replaced with a similar one that had been a stand by
  generator. It was marinised together with a second hand gearbox. She was back
  sailing in 1986.
