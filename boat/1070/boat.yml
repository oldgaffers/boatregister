  Pilot Cutter, built for pilot Arthur Case at Pill in 1903 by Edwin Rowles. Convered

full_description: "<p>&#39;Peggy&#39; was built for the Bristol Channel pilot Arthur\
  \ Case in 1903 at Pill. Tragically, he was drowned several years later when boarding\
  \ a ship off Nash Point. &#39;Peggy&#39; then became a Cardiff boat, later moving\
  \ to Newport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was converted to a yacht at Moodys at Swanwick in\
  \ the 1920s. By the 1960s she was in poor condition and Alan Savage carried out\
  \ extensive work, including replanking the topsides. When the Pridie family bought\
  \ her the bottom leaked like a sieve, the decks were in a poor state and the mast\
  \ needed serious attention. The Pridie family enjoyed several years of sailing,\
  \ patching the bottom as necessary. Originally the hull had been bronze fastened\
  \ but a previous owner had replaced some planks with ungalvanised nails which caused\
  \ a reaction with the bronze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a return trip from the Scilly Islands\
  \ a friend mistook a Channel buoy for something else and the subsequent collision\
  \ broke the bowsprit, split the stem and the topmast came down. They kept the boat\
  \ afloat for six hours before being towed into Padstow by the lifeboat. Here they\
  \ met a shipwright, Nimrod Bawden, who fitted a new stem and replaced the planking\
  \ surrounding it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pridies decided to replank the bottom and by\
  \ 1981 a fair bit had been replaced. &#39;Peggy&#39; competed in the OGA Race at\
  \ Dartmouth but on the return to Bristol disaster hit again when they sat on a pile\
  \ and punched a hole in the hull. She was salvaged and it was realised that &#39;Peggy&#39;\
  \ needed a major refit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boat was replanked and the deck beams\
  \ replaced. In 1985 she was refloated and the following winter the deck was replanked.\
  \ Much of the deck furniture had been salvaged and reused. A new hollow Noble mast\
  \ and spars were added with new sails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally &#39;Peggy&#39;\
  \ would not have had an engine, however she had acquired one of of dubious age and\
  \ this was replaced with a similar one that had been a stand by generator. It was\
  \ marinised together with a second hand gearbox. She was back sailing in 1986.</p>"
