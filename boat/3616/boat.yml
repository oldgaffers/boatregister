  In the April 2023 Small Boats Monthly, Nigel Sharp wrote: "In 1883 the Humber
  Yawl Club was formed in northeast England by a group of canoeing enthusiasts who
  felt that the conditions in the Humber estuary required more seaworthy craft
  than they had previously used. This led to the designing and building of
  so-called canoe yawls, although strictly speaking they were neither. Not only
  did they race against each other, both paddling and sailing, but they were also
  cruised extensively on sheltered inland waters. In the days before cars were
  used to trailer boats, the canoe yawls were built very lightly so that they
  could be loaded and carried on trains, and occasionally they were also
  transported by steamer to the European mainland. One of the Humber Yawl Club’s
  founding members was a young engineer called George Holmes who, in 1888,
  designed a canoe yawl called ETHEL which was built locally by J. Akester. At
  13′2″ ETHEL was specifically designed to fit in a guard’s van (caboose) on a
  train, and her beam allowed two people to sleep on board, on either side of the
  centerboard case.

  In 1991, *Classic Boat* magazine ran a series of articles on the build of a
  strip-planked replica of ETHEL. On seeing this, Tom Dunderdale commissioned Paul
  Fisher of Selway Fisher Design to design a slightly larger version. The result
  was the Lillie design which, with a length of 14′11″, could be built of
  stitch-and-glue plywood using 8′ sheets of plywood scarfed together, with seven
  strakes. Although Tom’s boat was built this way, Paul also produced plans to
  allow strip-planked construction."
