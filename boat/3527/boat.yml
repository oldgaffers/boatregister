  sales_text: "Redwing is a Lapstrake Gaff Cutter, an Ebihen 16, designed by Francois\
    \ Vivier\nwho has designed many smaller boats and is well recognised as an excellent\n\
    designer. This boat is seaworthy and stable, especially with 160 litres of water\n\
    ballast and a galvanised steel centreboard weighing approximately 45kg. There\
    \ is\nbuilt-in buoyancy of approx 460l. The boat is launched from a roller trailer,\n\
    especially built for this boat by Admiral Trailers of Honiton.\n\n\nThe hull is\
    \ 9mm ply, CNC cut by Jordons Boats and is mostly painted with 2-pack\nwhite polyurethane\
    \ inc undercoat, except the lapstrake plank (top), which is\nSapele varnished\
    \ with Ephifanes UV varnish. The first 3 planks are sheathed on\nthe outside with\
    \ S-glass as is the inside of the centreboard box. The interior\nis mostly Douglas\
    \ fir and Sapele. Fittings are mostly Bronze supplied by Classic\nMarine. There\
    \ is a large forward locker and two underseat lockers and floor\nstowage for the\
    \ oars. The sails are red and made by Rowsells of Exmouth.\n\n\nLength over Deck\
    \ (LOD) 4.88m/16ft\n\n\nLength Overall (LOA) 6.68m/21.9ft\n\n\nWaterline Length\
    \ 4.4m\n\n\nDraft (Centreboard Up) 0.84m\n\n\nDraft (Centreboard Down) 1.05m\n\
    \n\nWeight 510kg approx\n\n\nSail areas: Main 12.6m2; Staysail 3.0m2; Jib 3.4m2;\
    \ Total 19m2\n\n\nThe mast is Douglas fir, epoxy-glued in 4 quadrants with selective\
    \ hollowing for\nweight reduction, strengthened in places at high wear or stress.\
    \ Height 6m, keel\nstepped and fits into a custom gate.\n\n\nA mast-down cover\
    \ is included and was made to measure by Exe Sails and Covers\nnear Topsham. The\
    \ bespoke trailer was built by Admiral Trailers, based near\nHoniton is also included.\
    \ There is a Mariner 5 Outboard is available separately.\nThis has had very little\
    \ use from new, purchased from Mount Batten Boathouse in\nTurnchapel, Plymouth.\n\
    \n\nThe boat is currently in secure storage near where we live near Tavistock.\n\
    Viewing by appointment only, contact initially by eMail to\n[yottienick@icloud.com](mailto:yottienick@icloud.com).\n\
    \n\nRedwing cost about \xA310,500 in materials and I am looking to recoup that\
    \ and\nperhaps an element of my skilled labour and other expenses.\n\n"
