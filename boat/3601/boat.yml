short_description: |-
  Although not old by OGA standards Solveig has been around for a while but having
  been stored inside for a long period and rigourously maintained, she beautifuly
  built and is in terrific condition. Recently converted to a fully battened loose
  footed mainsail, the boat is easily handled and sails well.
