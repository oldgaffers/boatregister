short_description: |-
  Wren was the first of Whisstock's Deben four-tonner class built after the war
  with a full width coachroof. She was built in 1947 with a bermudan sail plan and
  during her restoration needed to be completely refastened under the waterline.
full_description: |-
  Wren was built in 1947 by Whistocks on the river Deben. She was the first of the
  class built with a full width coachroof. Later on a doghouse was added giving
  her even more room below decks.


  She was owned for many years by Percy Woodcock, a well known marine writer, and
  based on the south coast of England. Since the turn of the millenium Wren has
  returned to the east coast, kept at Walton-on-the-Naze. She was acquired by Pete
  Thomas who found her in a sorry state in need of a good refit. This refit has in
  reallity turned out to be a rebuild. The boat has been stripped of her interior
  (much not original) providing access to remove and replace broken timbers.
  Surprisingly the majority of the copper fastenings below the waterline were in a
  very poor state and need refastening
