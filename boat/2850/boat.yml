short_description: Wren was the first of the Whisstocks Deben four-tonner class built
  after the war with a full width coachroof. She was built in 1947 with a bermudan
  sail plan and during her restoration needed to be completely refastened under the
  waterline.
full_description: "<p>Wren was built in 1947 by Whistocks on the river Deben. She\
  \ was the first of the class built with a full width coachroof. Later on a doghouse\
  \ was added giving her even more room below decks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was owned for\
  \ many years by Percy Woodcock, a well known marine writer, and based on the south\
  \ coast of England. Since the turn of the millenium Wren has returned to the east\
  \ coast, kept at Walton on the Naze. She was acquired by Pete Thomas who found her\
  \ in a sorry state in need of a good refit. This refit has in reallity turned out\
  \ to be a rebuild. The boat has been stripped of her interior (much not original)\
  \ providing access to remove and replace broken timbers. Surprisingly the majority\
  \ of the copper fastenings below the waterline were in a very poor state and need\
  \ refastening</p>"
