He compares catboats and gaffers for speed and stability, summing up\nthe article as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The basic catboat has a well for an outboard but 'Felix' has a small inboard to\ngive that extra security when sailing offshore. Last year [1995] her owners\nsailed her to the Isles of Scilly which shows a measure of their confidence in\nher sea-keeping abilities. All in all this boat was great fun to sail and even\nmore, I would imagine, to own. She sailed and handled well, an ideal daysailer\nor even weekender for those who enjoy camping. The new sailing horizons that she\ncould open up in any estuary or river complex would provide a new dimension to\nsomeone who has owned larger and deeper craft but is now seeking all the fun but\nwith less work during the winter months She is also the kind of boat that might\ntempt an owner to keep her in the water all year round, just to enjoy those\nsunny days of solitude during the off season.</p>\n</blockquote>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.286, "draft": 0.405, "length_on_deck": 4.877, "length_on_waterline": 4.673, "length_over_all": 4.87685930260912, "main": {"foot": 4.877, "head": 4.139, "luff": 2.896}, "propellor": {"type": "none"}, "sailarea": 18.799, "thcf": 0.797}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "BRANCASTER STAITHE", "hull_form": "centre-boarder", "id": "ff99b4ab-1678-4b81-9657-a00bfc0e73b9", "image_key": "X9bkr7", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Felix", "oga_no": 1494, "ownerships": [{"id": 35022, "member": 6290, "share": 64}, {"end": 1989, "name": "Paul Gelder", "share": 64, "start": 1982}, {"end": 1993, "name": "Robin Ford", "share": 64, "start": 1989}, {"end": 2002, "name": "Richard Songer", "share": 64, "start": 1993}, {"end": 2006, "name": "Andrew Noquet", "share": 64, "start": 2002}, {"end": 2012, "name": "Mike Bell", "share": 64, "start": 2006}, {"end": 2015, "name": "Ray Smith", "share": 64, "start": 2012}, {"end": 2018, "name": " Jeff Condell", "share": 64, "start": 2015}], "place_built": "Skipool Creek", "rig_type": "Cat Boat", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'Felix' is a cat boat, designed by Andrew Wolstenholme and built by David Moss\nBoatbuilders in 1982.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-bqxdxZ5/0/Th/i-bqxdxZ5-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1982, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/1494"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
