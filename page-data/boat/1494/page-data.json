If you can help, please <a href=\"mailto:log@oga.org.uk?subject=Catboat%20Felix\">contact the Editor with more details</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m trying to trace my first wooden boat which I bought in 1982 &ndash; a 16ft Cape Cod Catboat designed by Andrew Wolstenholme and built by David Moss, in Skipool Creek, near Fleetwood, Lancs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sold her in 1989 to a Robin Ford, who kept her at Maylandsea, Essex, and renamed her <i>Felix</i>. In 1993 Richard Songer bought her and she moved to Cornwall. It was Songer who made the modifications mentioned in the article by Martin Tregoning in The Boatman (see below). In 2002 Andrew Noquet, Tavistock Devon, bought her from Songer. He sold her around 2006 to Mike Bell, a BA pilot in Lancashire who sold her to&nbsp;a Ray Smith in 2012. Ray Smith died c.2015, selling &#39;Felix&#39; shortly before his death.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Felix&#39; was launched in 1982, the inspiration of two men: Andrew Wolstenholme, a young designer who had spent time on the north east coast of the USA and David Moss, a Lancashire boatbuilder. The design is influenced by the catboat&#39;s of Cape Cod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an article in <a href=\"/sites/default/files/Catboat%2016%20Felix%20The%20Boatman%201996.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&#39;The Boatman&#39;, April 1996</a>, Martin Tregoning discussed the catboat&#39;s design and rig, taking &#39;Felix&#39; as an example. He compares catboats and gaffers for speed and stability, summing up the article as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The basic catboat has a well for an outboard but &#39;Felix&#39; has a small inboard to give that extra security when sailing offshore. Last year [1995] her owners sailed her to the Isles of Scilly which shows a measure of their confidence in her sea-keeping abilities. All in all this boat was great fun to sail and even more, I would imagine, to own. She sailed and handled well, an ideal daysailer or even weekender for those who enjoy camping. The new sailing hotizons that she could open up in any estuary or river complex would provide a new dimension to someone who has owned larger and deeper craft but is now seeking all the fun but with less work during the winter months She is also the kind of boat that might tempt an owner to keep her in the water all year round, just to enjoy those sunny days of solitude during the off season.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","image_key":"X9bkr7","uk_part1":null,"rig_type":"cat_boat","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","spar_material":"wood","construction_details":"cold moulded mahogany","draft":0.4054,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.286027798098025,"main":{"foot":4.87685930260912,"head":4.13923433308949,"luff":2.8956352109241648},"thcf":0.797467466,"draft":0.396244818336991,"length_over_all":4.87685930260912,"length_on_waterline":4.672640819312362},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":4.8768,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Felix&#39; is a cat boat, designed by Andrew Wolstenholme and built by David Moss Boatbuilders in 1982.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-31T17:02:51.615102+00:00","website":"","beam":2.286,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"57e22238-cdd2-4556-a3f3-ef834d765e07","designer":"ef8240d6-ca0a-4acb-bae8-3592df7703d4","design_class":"7f25ca5d-8be8-41ca-98fe-484c35b41548","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Catboat 16"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Andrew Wolstenholme"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"cat_boat"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"David Moss Boatbuilders","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
