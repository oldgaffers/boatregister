The interior is sound but in need of attention, retaining most of its original fittings. Full standing headroom, no heads. Currently cutter rigged with retracting furling gear fitted to bowspit and a tabernacle stepped mast. Traditional red sails in useable condition. Engine is said to be serviceable. Good useable cockpit tent/cover.
