She was built in\na purpose built shed in Lewisham, South London, by the owner of a joinery\nbusiness called Herbert E Kennard and launched, from a timber cart, at Greenwich\non Saturday 28t June 1902. She cost \u00a376-2-7d to build, which for that time was a\ngreat deal of money for a yacht of this size.</p>\n<p>26 ft.LOA 6 ft. 6\" beam and 3 ft. 9\" draft, Kelpie II is a canoe yacht, gaff\nsloop rig, with designed displacement of 4000lbs. She has a plate and bulb keel\nwith semi balanced spade rudder. The boat was advanced for her time featuring\nroller reefing on both main and jib, also all control lines were bought back to\nthe cockpit, and of course there is the keel. Fin and bulb keels were not that\nuncommon on racing keelboats but on a yacht it was a bit unusual and, although\nthe plate is new owner, Rik Graham, was very careful when replacing it to\nmaintain the geometry of the original.</p>\n<p>The week after Kelpie was launched she started her career cruising the East\nCoast, from a base at Erith Yacht Club until 1973 but then from Pin Mill. Whilst\nbased at Erith she had a very succesful racing career, particularly in the hands\nof her builder who helmed her until he was in his 80s. Of course time marches on\nand H E eventually passed Kelpie II to his son Dave who brought her to Pin Mill.</p>\n<p>Dave seems to have used Kelpie II mostly as a day sailer, with the occasional\nrace, and sailed with a Barry Page who bought her in 1989 when Dave, in his\nturn, got too old to use her. Barry did some work on the boat replacing one\ngarboard and having the decks plywood and epoxy sheathed but again day sailing,\nkeeping her going none the less.</p>\n<p>At about the time that Barry was thinking that maintenance was getting to much\nfor him Rik came onto the scene and became her latest owner in 2004.
