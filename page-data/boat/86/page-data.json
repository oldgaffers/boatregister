Mr GA Marshall owned her for 3 Â½ years before bringing her down to the Dart in Devon from Jul 1983 (?). Since then she has been used to cruise the coasts and rivers of Devon and Cornwall. She has taken part in the Brixham Heritage Regatta, OGA South West events and Plymouth &amp; Fowey Classics.</p>\n<p>She is a pretty, well-designed boat. Her lifting keel means that she has also explored the upper reaches of the Exe, Dart, Tamar, Fowey and Helford</p>\n<p>She was brought down to Helford from Brixham in 2018 and proved to be a very kindly boat - easily sailed single handed. She entered the Falmouth classics in June 2018 and 2019. In May 2019 her keel fell off (3/4\" bolt rusted through) and keel had to be manufactured from drawings. This was completed in time to the Falmouth classics and she is back in the water. She also attended the SW Gaffers parade of sail at Plymouth in Jul 2019 overnighting at Cawsand and Polperro.</p>","image_key":"wvpD9T","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"clinker","construction_details":"Clinker, iroko on oak with copper rivets and a galvanised iron keel, cast iron ballast on keel and internal.","draft":0.762,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.13362594489149,"main":{"foot":3.733845403560107,"head":3.0480370641306997,"luff":3.6576444769568397},"thcf":0.845,"topsail":{"luff":3.0480370641306997,"perpendicular":1.5240185320653499},"sailarea":22.644830591571598,"propellor":{"type":"none"},"length_over_all":5.843087051938552,"fore_triangle_base":3.0480370641306997,"length_on_waterline":5.6388685686417945,"fore_triangle_height":4.26725188978298},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.843,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Mayblossom is a New Blossom Class Yacht designed by John Leather and built in 1973.
