She was converted\nfor pleasure use in Rye in 1946. In 1956 she was bought by John Jefferson and\nkept in Chichester Harbour. She was much cruised by the family between Biscay\nand the Baltic and Ireland including French and Dutch inland waterways.</p>\n<p>Around 1990 she was surveyed and declared beyond repair since the frames were\nseriously rotted. The owner had a replica hull built by Hullmaster of Wootton,\nIOW. The \u2018new\u2019 Patsy was launched in 1991, fitted with the original rigging and\nsails and returned to her berth in Birdham Pool.
