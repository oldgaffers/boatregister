She was converted for pleasure use in Rye in 1946.  In 1956 she was bought by John Jefferson and kept in Chichester Harbour.  She was much cruised by the family between Biscay and the Baltic and Ireland including French and Dutch inland waterways.\r\n\r\nAround 1990 she was surveyed and declared beyond repair since the frames were seriously rotted.  The owner had a replica hull built by Hullmaster of Wootton, IOW.  The ‘new’ Patsy was launched in 1991, fitted with the original rigging and sails and returned to her berth in Birdham Pool.  In 2000 she was moved to Carentan on the Cherbourg Peninsula where she was based until her return to Chichester in 2018.","image_key":"m3kc3Q","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-s8zTnjF/0/Th/i-s8zTnjF-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":1.2192,"generic_type":"Polperro Gaffer","handicap_data":{"beam":2.3104120946110704,"main":{"foot":4.901243599122164,"head":3.453425993660083,"luff":5.105462082418922},"thcf":0.947181293,"draft":1.21921482565228,"topsail":{"luff":4.291636186296025,"perpendicular":1.929407461594733},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":7.620092660326749,"fore_triangle_base":5.18166300902219,"length_on_waterline":7.187271397220189,"fore_triangle_height":7.595708363813704},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.62,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Pronounced beyond economic repair around 1990, but a replica hull was built and &quot;Patsy&quot; is still sailing today.</p>","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00","website":"","beam":2.3104,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"c42a9f34-ed3d-4b18-a79e-2ef78e49687a","designer":null,"design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":null,"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Polperro Gaffer"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Pearce"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
