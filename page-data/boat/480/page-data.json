Her sail number is FD44 (Fleetwood). In the 1930s she took part in the Fleetwood &ndash; Isle of Man Race. Bought in 1965 by John Gill, a housemaster at Rossall School near Fleetwood, the boat was used to teach sailing to boys at the school.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1900: John Jackson of North Scales, Walney Island who was a farmer, ferryman or both ordered &lsquo;Cock of the North&rsquo; from Crossfield Brothers for &pound;70. Having left Arnside in calm weather, &lsquo;Cock of the North&rsquo; was wrecked in a gale on her maiden voyage. She was crewed by John Jackson and his three sons and was lost when entering the Walney Channel off Piel Island with tide and wind against her. All her crew survive&nbsp;unharmed.<br />\r\n1901: Local boatmen take a collection for a replacement boat. A poem is written about the &lsquo;Cock of the North&rsquo; which is said to have been recited in the local theatre to raise money.<br />\r\n1902: John Jackson orders &lsquo;Ploughboy&rsquo; as a replacement yacht. As part of the contract Crossfields had to deliver the boat to Walney Island.<br />\r\n1907: Recorded as taking part in both Roa Island and First Barrow Yacht Club Regattas, owned by J.Jackson. In this year she won the Vickerstown and North Scale Gayner Cup, which was named after Sir George Gayner MP&nbsp;by winning it three times. (1903, 1905, 1907)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Jimmy Jackson remembered&nbsp;crewing with his father in &#39;Plougboy&#39;, along with his elder brother Harry. Jimmy&#39;s job was to shift the ballast up to the weather side when racing. When one considers that the ballast consisted of 56lb weights one can imagine that hard work was the order of the day when beating to windward. On occasions &#39;Ploughboy&#39; was skippered by a professional seaman from St Annes, and a local man by the name of Fred Woods was also known to have acted as helmsman during racing.<br />\r\n1914-5: Sold to &quot;Dutch Jack&quot; Verscholye, (the skipper of the Workington dredger), then later she was sold to Mr Ford of Haverigg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning to Barrow in the early 1920s she was purchased by Mr Thompson who modified her keel with the addition of extra weights bolted on each side.<br />\r\n1920s: Recorded as taking part in Wardleys Regatta on River Wyre near Fleetwood, owned by J.Thompson of Ramsden Dock Road, Barrow.<br />\r\n1922: Recorded as taking part in the half decked fishing boat race at Morecambe Regatta, owned T.Thompson of Morecambe, suggesting use as a fishing boat.<br />\r\n1930&nbsp;&amp; 1931: Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by R.S.Taylor (second place, 1931).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>at some point in the 1930s &#39;Ploughboy&#39; was owned by Bill Kitchen, and international speedway and TT racer. He kept the boat at Fleetwood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1935 Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by H.Foote. Other Crossfield yachts in the race are &lsquo;Lalla Rookh&#39; and &lsquo;Nanette&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1965: Bought by John Gill, housemaster at Rossall School, near Fleetwood. Her frames were found to be rotten. Mr Gill and his partner refastened the yacht completely and laminated 32 new oak frames and replaced several planks. A new deck was also fitted but the coach roof was left on, this being in perfect condition. (&#39;Ploughboy&#39; when built was not fitted with a cabin, so the coach&nbsp;roof would not be as old&nbsp;as the hull).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Ploughboy&rsquo; is used to teach sailing at the school. Sailed to Solway, Isle of Man, Menai Straits and Scottish Isles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1978 sold to Brian Parry and taken to Gillingham, Kent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1996-2004 owned by Ian Ruffles, Gillingham</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2004: Bought by Robert Raynor of Knott End on the other side of the Wyre Estuary from Fleetwood. Under his ownership &lsquo;Ploughboy&rsquo; competed in Liverpool Nobby Races. He also sailed her up to Arnside, anchoring overnight at New Barns Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2012: Bought by new owner.
