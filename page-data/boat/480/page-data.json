Her sail number is FD44\n(Fleetwood). In the 1930s she took part in the Fleetwood \u2013 Isle of Man Race.\nBought in 1965 by John Gill, a housemaster at Rossall School near Fleetwood, the\nboat was used to teach sailing to boys at the school.</p>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>1900: John Jackson of North Scales, Walney Island who was a farmer, ferryman or\nboth ordered \u2018Cock of the North\u2019 from Crossfield Brothers for \u00a370. Having left\nArnside in calm weather, \u2018Cock of the North\u2019 was wrecked in a gale on her maiden\nvoyage. She was crewed by John Jackson and his three sons and was lost when\nentering the Walney Channel off Piel Island with tide and wind against her. All\nher crew survive unharmed.    1901: Local boatmen take a collection for a\nreplacement boat. A poem is written about the \u2018Cock of the North\u2019 which is said\nto have been recited in the local theatre to raise money.    1902: John Jackson\norders \u2018Ploughboy\u2019 as a replacement yacht. As part of the contract Crossfields\nhad to deliver the boat to Walney Island.    1907: Recorded as taking part in\nboth Roa Island and First Barrow Yacht Club Regattas, owned by J.Jackson. In\nthis year she won the Vickerstown and North Scale Gayner Cup, which was named\nafter Sir George Gayner MP by winning it three times. (1903, 1905, 1907)</p>\n<p>Mr Jimmy Jackson remembered crewing with his father in 'Plougboy', along with\nhis elder brother Harry. Jimmy's job was to shift the ballast up to the weather\nside when racing. When one considers that the ballast consisted of 56lb weights\none can imagine that hard work was the order of the day when beating to\nwindward. On occasions 'Ploughboy' was skippered by a professional seaman from\nSt Annes, and a local man by the name of Fred Woods was also known to have acted\nas helmsman during racing.    1914-5: Sold to \"Dutch Jack\" Verscholye, (the\nskipper of the Workington dredger), then later she was sold to Mr Ford of\nHaverigg.</p>\n<p>Returning to Barrow in the early 1920s she was purchased by Mr Thompson who\nmodified her keel with the addition of extra weights bolted on each side.\n1920s: Recorded as taking part in Wardleys Regatta on River Wyre near Fleetwood,\nowned by J.Thompson of Ramsden Dock Road, Barrow.    1922: Recorded as taking\npart in the half decked fishing boat race at Morecambe Regatta, owned T.Thompson\nof Morecambe, suggesting use as a fishing boat.    1930 &amp; 1931: Takes part in\nFleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by R.S.Taylor (second place, 1931).</p>\n<p>At some point in the 1930s 'Ploughboy' was owned by Bill Kitchen, and\ninternational speedway and TT racer. He kept the boat at Fleetwood.</p>\n<p>1935 Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by H.Foote. Other\nCrossfield yachts in the race are \u2018Lalla Rookh' and \u2018Nanette\u2019.</p>\n<p>1965: Bought by John Gill, housemaster at Rossall School, near Fleetwood. Her\nframes were found to be rotten. Mr Gill and his partner refastened the yacht\ncompletely and laminated 32 new oak frames and replaced several planks. A new\ndeck was also fitted but the coach roof was left on, this being in perfect\ncondition. ('Ploughboy' when built was not fitted with a cabin, so the coach\nroof would not be as old as the hull).</p>\n<p>\u2018Ploughboy\u2019 is used to teach sailing at the school. Sailed to Solway, Isle of\nMan, Menai Straits and Scottish Isles.</p>\n<p>1978 sold to Brian Parry and taken to Gillingham, Kent</p>\n<p>1996-2004 owned by Ian Ruffles, Gillingham</p>\n<p>2004: Bought by Robert Raynor of Knott End on the other side of the Wyre Estuary\nfrom Fleetwood. Under his ownership \u2018Ploughboy\u2019 competed in Liverpool Nobby\nRaces. He also sailed her up to Arnside, anchoring overnight at New Barns Bay.</p>\n<p>2012: Bought by new owner.
