Rigs varied, this example features a high peak gaff and short bowsprit. Sister boat <em>Will'O-The-Wisp</em> (2947) features a loose foot lugsail, <em>Dovey Tryst</em> (2531) a yawl configuration. The rig for <em>Orca </em>(3056) is unknown. Sail rigs were designed by John Wilkingson, creator of the Drascombe series and original sails (still fitted to <em>Flirt</em>) by Andrew Hooper.</p>\n<p>The hull mould was taken from <em>Shamrock </em>a crabber built by John Hockaday in the late 1800's and purchased by his great great grandson's Harry &amp; Jack Hockaday as forlorn motor launch <em>Shula </em>from local Jim Hill in 1976. The misshapen and dilapidated hull was repaired and reworked before a series of four Whaler rowing boats and lugg rigged <em>Shamrock </em>herself were launched at the village regatta in July 1979. The four Whalers still exist and recently refurbished are used at Yealm and Dartmouth Regattas. Shamrock with small cabin featured in local news in 2013 then owned by 'Sail Trade' delivering local produce from the Tamar valley to River Cottage at Plymouth's Royal William Yard.</p>\n<p><em>Flirt </em>was extensively overhauled and refitted following purchase Autumn 2019 benefiting from additional attention during the 2020 Covid lockdown. Now based on the River Dart and discovered to be a fast hull with powerful rig. These features tie in with the online conjecture that the original design was designed for quick access to offshore crabbing grounds some distance from the mouth of the Yealm.
