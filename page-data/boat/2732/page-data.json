She has many modifications for long sea passages. We carry two outboards, one in the well and one on a bracket. She has excellent ground tackle and exceedingly good navigation lights. The lead ballast is firmly lashed in with small lorry straps, and there is a semi self-draining cockpit which also has flotation. There are two bilge pumps, one which is an extremely large whale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When making the passage to Cherbourg in rough weather, summer 2015, one comment was made that it was a foolhardy trip! Roy&#39;s response is: &quot;I have 52 years of sailing experience, well over 100,000 sea miles under my belt plus I do take my sailing extremely seriously. I gave the person a quote made by Chris Bonnington, who had just lost a friend on a mountaineering expedition. He had replied to a similar comment by saying: &lsquo;We take risks not to escape life, but to prevent life escaping us.&rsquo;&quot;</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.1336, "draft": 0.5334, "length_on_deck": 5.7912, "length_on_waterline": 5.690685198732017, "length_over_all": 5.7912704218483295}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Battlesbridge", "hull_form": "unknown", "id": "cb83a0f1-c0c2-4dde-9238-17734abd8571", "image_key": "2TbfGM", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Greensleeves", "oga_no": 2732, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 485, "member": 4649, "share": 64, "start": 2008}], "place_built": "Bursledon", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>&#39;Greensleeves&#39; is a 19&#39; Memory &#39;with two 7&#39; berths, a cooker, sink, red and black bucket, a good sail wardrobe and two outboards&#39;.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-gsP5sc2/0/Th/i-gsP5sc2-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1998, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2732"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
