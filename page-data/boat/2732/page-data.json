She has many modifications for long sea passages. We carry two outboards, one in the well and one on a bracket. She has excellent ground tackle and exceedingly good navigation lights. The lead ballast is firmly lashed in with small lorry straps, and there is a semi self-draining cockpit which also has flotation. There are two bilge pumps, one which is an extremely large whale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When making the passage to Cherbourg in rough weather, summer 2015, one comment was made that it was a foolhardy trip! Roy&#39;s response is: &quot;I have 52 years of sailing experience, well over 100,000 sea miles under my belt plus I do take my sailing extremely seriously. I gave the person a quote made by Chris Bonnington, who had just lost a friend on a mountaineering expedition. He had replied to a similar comment by saying: &lsquo;We take risks not to escape life, but to prevent life escaping us.&rsquo;&quot;</p>","image_key":"2TbfGM","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"construction_details":"GRP","designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Anthony Robinson"},"draft":0.5334,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"length_overall":5.7912,"length_on_waterline":5.6906},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.7912,"mainsail_type":"gaff","rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Greensleeves&#39; is a 19&#39; Memory &#39;with two 7&#39; berths, a cooker, sink, red and black bucket, a good sail wardrobe and two outboards&#39;.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:07:50.903117+00:00","website":"","genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Salterns Boatyard Ltd.","notes":null},"beam":2.1336,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
