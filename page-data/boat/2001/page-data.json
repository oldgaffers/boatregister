In 2018 we converted her to a junk rig, placing her new unstayed Douglas fir mast right up forward to a step in the fo'c's'le. The boat's handling is completely transformed. She works like a dinghy and looks not unlike a Loch Fyne Skiff. We sail, and enjoy sailing, so much more than before - because reefing is so easy, we sail her with the optimum sail up and get the most out of her wonderful hull and balance in this way. We have retained her gaff rig and all serviceable parts, including a brand new mainsail by Steve Hall, North Sea Sails. I could convert her back again in short order for anyone who wishes it. Annie is in a shed at Crinan Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the harbour there on a swinging mooring. She is still 'Of Falmouth' despite having been in Crinan for over three decades. Falmouth is the place of her birth.</p><p>Annie has a very pleasant varnished pine/white painted interior, with full sized chart table to stbd opposite the galley, two wide quarter berths and two berths in the saloon. The fo'c's'le is through a door and houses the mast step and head, chain locker etc.</p>","image_key":"GVHt7w","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":"GRP","draft":1.143,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"main":{"foot":5.6388685686417945,"head":4.495854669592782,"luff":4.953060229212387},"thcf":0.969236092,"draft":1.1430138990490124,"topsail":{"luff":5.715069495245062,"perpendicular":2.286027798098025},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":9.1441111923921,"fore_triangle_base":5.7912704218483295,"length_on_waterline":7.848695440136551,"fore_triangle_height":8.458302852962692},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.144,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Annie is the first Pilot Cutter taken from the mould.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:39:26.552633+00:00","website":"","beam":2.8956,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"2bdd8cf6-ba06-4a2b-9894-d7e26c6261ad","designer":"af6f6943-2024-44d5-af5e-a6e63fc66db5","design_class":"5bfb6ea5-ee56-40f5-bc71-ed0d31fbee8e","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"cold_moulded"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Cornish Crabber Pilot Cutter 30"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Roger Dongray"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Cornish Crabbers Ltd."},"for_sale_state":{"text":"for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":36500}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
