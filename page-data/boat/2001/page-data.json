Survey 2024 reveals no problems. Beautiful new   mainsail by North\nSea\\nSails has had 3 (very) short seasons. Unique varnished pine and  white\npainted\\ninterior. Extra-roomy forecabin/head. Recently painted deck and\nfore-cabin.   PART EXCHANGE: We wish to down-size, so would consider a smaller\nboat  (Mk1 Crabber, possibly Golant Gaffer or other capable trailerable vessel)\nIn part exchange. <em>Annie</em> is the first of the Cornish Crabber Pilot Cutters,\nsail number P1. With this design Roger Dongray launched a wonderfully seaworthy\nand classic-looking GRP gaff cutter into a market where such a thing was a\nrarity. It is hard to name a better-looking traditional working boat design\nfrom that time. Built in 1985, she\u00a0 was acquired from Roger Dongray by her\ncurrent family in 1989.</p>\n<p><em>Annie</em> has spent the winters since 1989 in a cosy boat shed for at least 7\nmonths of every year. Her gaff rig includes a new mainsail. Wykeham Martin\nfurling jib and foil-reefing staysail. Her engine is her original Volvo 18hp\ndiesel, which has never missed a beat. With a centreboard, (draft 1.07m-1.6m)\nthis boat has to be one of the best designed modern gaffers,- often called   the\nprettiest boat in the anchorage, and a modern classic.</p>\n<p>Below she has two snug double quarterberths, two saloon berths, and a full\nsized chart table to starboard, opposite the galley. Gimballed two burner  gas\ncooker with grill and oven. On the aft end of the cabin table a Taylors\nparaffin stove keeps the crew warm and the boat dry even in the cooler Scottish\nsummers. This has the more recent German-made burner which is very much easier\nto light and maintain than its predecessor.  Through a varnished pine door to\nthe forecabin, the Blakes Lavac head (2018) is  offset, unusually, to one side,\nallowing a lot more space to change clothing in  privacy, and to get at the\nchain locker forward and other stowage. Ample  hanging/dripping space for wet\nweather gear, with a small sump under the floor  to catch the run-off.</p>\n<p>Her interior, well lit with clear hatches above and portholes in the saloonis\nall varnish/oil and white paint. There are heavy cotton cushion covers for  each\nbunk as well as the seagoing waterproof covers, and lee-cloths for the  saloon\nberths. Insulation under all of the berth cushions has eliminated condensation\nthere. Insulation behind the bunks has proved effective also. She has no\nelectronics  currently but there are places\u00a0 for echo, vhf and an electronic\nlog, with all the   necessary wiring.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Annie</em> has had wheel steering but is now back to her original tiller. All the\ngear for the wheel is available. She has fisherman and cqr anchors on heavy\nchain, and an electric windlass. Her tabernacle-stepped mast and the spars  are\nmaintained with Sikkens Cetol. Our own mix of dark red, and green paint  has\nreplaced most of the varnished brightwork on the coamings around the large\ncockpit and on rubbing strake and toe rail, making maintenance easier and\nbringing her back to her working boat roots. Her glass sheathed plywood deck\nwas repainted after careful preparation in 2024. All guard-rail stanchions have\nbeen re-bedded 2023/24.  <em>Annie</em> is a boat that looks after her crew, and with\nher easy motion and  versatile gaff rig would make a fantastic cruising home.\nAfter a whole winter,  or even just an hour ashore, her crew always look forward\nto returning aboard.</p>\n<p>After 35 years with her in the family, we have reluctantly decided to down-size.\nWe would consider a part-exchange for a Mk1 Crabber, a Golant Gaffer, or any\nother capable, attractive and preferably trailerable cruising boat.</p>\n<p><em>Annie</em> is currently lying ashore on the west of Scotland. The plan to sail her\nround   to the Clyde for the winter 24/25 was thwarted by storm Ashley. Crinan\nis only 2 hours  drive from Glasgow. We will help in any way we can with lifts\nfrom Glasgow for anyone   wishing to view the boat if travelling far by public\ntransport.</p>", "summary": "<p>Final price not known</p>"}], "full_description": "<p><em>Annie</em> has been in the same ownership in the west of Scotland for most of her\nlife.\u00a0 <em>Annie</em> is in a shed at Crinan Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the\nharbour there on a swinging mooring.
