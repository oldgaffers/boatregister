Survey 2024 reveals no problems. Beautiful new \n mainsail by North Sea\\nSails has had 3 (very) short seasons. Unique varnished pine and\n white painted\\ninterior. Extra-roomy forecabin/head. Recently painted deck and\n fore-cabin. \n PART EXCHANGE: We wish to down-size, so would consider a smaller boat\n (Mk1 Crabber, possibly Golant Gaffer or other capable trailerable vessel)\n In part exchange. <em>Annie</em> is the first of the Cornish Crabber Pilot Cutters,\n sail number P1. With this design Roger Dongray launched a wonderfully seaworthy\n and classic-looking GRP gaff cutter into a market where such a thing was a\n rarity. It is hard to name a better-looking traditional working boat design\n from that time. Built in 1985, she\u00a0 was acquired from Roger Dongray by her\n current family in 1989.</p>\n<p><em>Annie</em> has spent the winters since 1989 in a cosy boat shed for at least 7\n months of every year. Her gaff rig includes a new mainsail. Wykeham Martin\n furling jib and foil-reefing staysail. Her engine is her original Volvo 18hp\n diesel, which has never missed a beat. With a centreboard, (draft 1.07m-1.6m)\n this boat has to be one of the best designed modern gaffers,- often called \n the prettiest boat in the anchorage, and a modern classic.</p>\n<p>Below she has two snug double quarterberths, two saloon berths, and a full\n sized chart table to starboard, opposite the galley. Gimballed two burner\n gas cooker with grill and oven. On the aft end of the cabin table a Taylors\n paraffin stove keeps the crew warm and the boat dry even in the cooler Scottish\n summers. This has the more recent German-made burner which is very much easier\n to light and maintain than its predecessor.\n Through a varnished pine door to the forecabin, the Blakes Lavac head (2018) is\n offset, unusually, to one side, allowing a lot more space to change clothing in\n privacy, and to get at the chain locker forward and other stowage. Ample\n hanging/dripping space for wet weather gear, with a small sump under the floor\n to catch the run-off.</p>\n<p>Her interior, well lit with clear hatches above and portholes in the saloonis\n all varnish/oil and white paint. There are heavy cotton cushion covers for\n each bunk as well as the seagoing waterproof covers, and lee-cloths for the\n saloon berths. Insulation under all of the berth cushions has eliminated condensation\n there. Insulation behind the bunks has proved effective also. She has no electronics\n currently but there are places\u00a0 for echo, vhf and an electronic log, with all the \n necessary wiring.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Annie</em> has had wheel steering but is now back to her original tiller. All the\n gear for the wheel is available. She has fisherman and cqr anchors on heavy\n chain, and an electric windlass. Her tabernacle-stepped mast and the spars\n are maintained with Sikkens Cetol. Our own mix of dark red, and green paint\n has replaced most of the varnished brightwork on the coamings around the large\n cockpit and on rubbing strake and toe rail, making maintenance easier and\n bringing her back to her working boat roots. Her glass sheathed plywood deck \n was repainted after careful preparation in 2024. All guard-rail stanchions have\n been re-bedded 2023/24.\n <em>Annie</em> is a boat that looks after her crew, and with her easy motion and\n versatile gaff rig would make a fantastic cruising home. After a whole winter,\n or even just an hour ashore, her crew always look forward to returning aboard.</p>\n<p>After 35 years with her in the family, we have reluctantly decided to down-size.\n We would consider a part-exchange for a Mk1 Crabber, a Golant Gaffer, or any\n other capable, attractive and preferably trailerable cruising boat. </p>\n<p><em>Annie</em> is currently lying ashore on the west of Scotland. The plan to sail her round \n to the Clyde for the winter 24/25 was thwarted by storm Ashley. Crinan is only 2 hours\n drive from Glasgow. We will help in any way we can with lifts from Glasgow for anyone \n wishing to view the boat if travelling far by public transport.</p>"}], "full_description": "<p><em>Annie</em> has been in the same ownership in the west of Scotland for most of her\nlife.\u00a0 <em>Annie</em> is in a shed at Crinan Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the\nharbour there on a swinging mooring.
