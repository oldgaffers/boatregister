With this design Roger Dongray launched a wonderfully seaworthy and classic-looking GRP gaff cutter into a market where such a thing was a rarity. It is hard to name a better-looking traditional working boat design from that time.\nBuilt in 1985, she\u00a0 was acquired from Roger Dongray by her current family in 1989. ANNIE has spent the winters since 1989 in a cosy boat shed for at least 7 months of every year. Her gaff rig includes a new mainsail. Wykeham Martin furling jib and foil-reefing staysail. Her engine is her original Volvo 18hp diesel, which has never missed a beat. With a centreboard, (draft 1.07m-1.6m) this boat has to be one of the best designed modern gaffers,\n\u00a0- often called the prettiest boat in the anchorage, and a modern classic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBelow she has two \"snug double\" quarterberths, two saloon berths, and a full sized chart table to starboard, opposite the galley. Gimballed two burner gas cooker with grill and oven. On the aft end of the cabin table a Taylors paraffin stove keeps the crew warm and the boat dry even in the cooler Scottish summers. This has the more recent German-made burner which is very much easier to light and maintain than its predecessor.\n\u00a0\nThrough a varnished pine door to the forecabin, the Blakes Lavac head (2018) is offset, unusually, to one side, allowing a lot more space to change clothing in privacy, and to get at the chain locker forward and other stowage. Ample hanging/dripping space for wet weather gear, with a small sump under the floor to catch the run-off.\n\u00a0\nHer interior, well lit with clear hatches above and portholes in the saloon is all varnish/oil and white paint. There are heavy cotton cushion covers for each bunk as well as the seagoing waterproof covers, and lee-cloths for the saloon berths. Insulation under all of the berth cushions has eliminated condensation there. S\nInsulation behind the bunks has proved effective also.\n\u00a0\nShe has no electronics currently but there are places\u00a0 for echo, vhf and an electronic log, with all the necessary wiring.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nANNIE has had wheel steering but is now back to her original tiller. All the gear for the wheel is available. She has fisherman and cqr anchors on heavy chain, and an electric windlass. Her tabernacle-stepped mast and the spars are maintained with Sikkens Cetol. Our own mix of dark red, and green paint has replaced most of the varnished brightwork on the coamings around the large cockpit and on rubbing strake and toe rail, making maintenance easier and bringing her back to her working boat roots. Her glass sheathed plywood deck was repainted after careful preparation in 2024. All guard-rail stanchions have been re-bedded 2023/24.\n\u00a0\nANNIE is a boat that looks after her crew, and with her easy motion and versatile gaff rig would make a fantastic cruising home. After a whole winter, or even just an hour ashore, her crew always look forward to returning aboard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter 35 years with her in the family, we have reluctantly decided to down-size. We would consider a part-exchange for a Mk1 Crabber, a Golant Gaffer, or any other capable, attractive and preferably trailerable cruising boat.\n\u00a0\nANNIE is currently lying ashore on the west of Scotland. The plan to sail her round to the Clyde for the winter 24/25 was thwarted by Ashley.\u00a0 Crinan is only 2 hours' drive from Glasgow. We will help in any way we can with lifts from Glasgow for anyone wishing to view the boat if travelling far\u00a0by public transport.</p>"}], "full_description": "<p>Annie has been in the same ownership in the west of Scotland for most of her\nlife. In 2018 we converted her to a junk rig, placing her new unstayed Douglas\nfir mast right up forward to a step in the fo'c's'le. The boat's handling is\ncompletely transformed. She works like a dinghy and looks not unlike a Loch Fyne\nSkiff. We sail, and enjoy sailing, so much more than before - because reefing is\nso easy, we sail her with the optimum sail up and get the most out of her\nwonderful hull and balance in this way. We have retained her gaff rig and all\nserviceable parts, including a brand new mainsail by Steve Hall, North Sea\nSails. I could convert her back again in short order for anyone who wishes it.\nAnnie is in a shed at Crinan Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the harbour\nthere on a swinging mooring. She is still 'Of Falmouth' despite having been in\nCrinan for over three decades. Falmouth is the place of her birth.</p>\n<p>Annie has a very pleasant varnished pine/white painted interior, with full sized\nchart table to stbd opposite the galley, two wide quarter berths and two berths\nin the saloon. The fo'c's'le is through a door and houses the mast step and\nhead, chain locker etc.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.896, "draft": 1.143, "length_on_deck": 9.144, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "ce63b03d-9618-4201-bb19-8dbc2509aea4", "image_key": "GVHt7w", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Annie", "oga_no": 2001, "ownerships": [{"end": 1986, "name": "R Dongray", "share": 64, "start": 1985}, {"current": true, "id": 220, "member": 3086, "share": 64, "start": 1986}], "place_built": "Rock", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Annie is the first Pilot Cutter taken from the mould.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2025-01-17", "year": 1985, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2001"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
