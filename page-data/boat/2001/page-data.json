In 2018 we converted her to a junk rig, placing her new unstayed Douglas\nfir mast right up forward to a step in the fo'c's'le. The boat's handling is\ncompletely transformed. She works like a dinghy and looks not unlike a Loch Fyne\nSkiff. We sail, and enjoy sailing, so much more than before - because reefing is\nso easy, we sail her with the optimum sail up and get the most out of her\nwonderful hull and balance in this way. We have retained her gaff rig and all\nserviceable parts, including a brand new mainsail by Steve Hall, North Sea\nSails. I could convert her back again in short order for anyone who wishes it.\nAnnie is in a shed at Crinan Boatyard Limited in the winter, and in the harbour\nthere on a swinging mooring. She is still 'Of Falmouth' despite having been in\nCrinan for over three decades. Falmouth is the place of her birth.</p>\n<p>Annie has a very pleasant varnished pine/white painted interior, with full sized\nchart table to stbd opposite the galley, two wide quarter berths and two berths\nin the saloon. The fo'c's'le is through a door and houses the mast step and\nhead, chain locker etc.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.896, "draft": 1.143, "length_on_deck": 9.144}, "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "ce63b03d-9618-4201-bb19-8dbc2509aea4", "image_key": "GVHt7w", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Annie", "oga_no": 2001, "ownerships": [{"end": 1986, "name": "R Dongray", "share": 64, "start": 1985}, {"current": true, "id": 220, "member": 3086, "share": 64, "start": 1986}], "place_built": "Rock", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Annie is the first Pilot Cutter taken from the mould.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "year": 1985, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2001"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
