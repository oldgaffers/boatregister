The yard became Summers &amp; Payne in 1890 before being taken over lock stock and workforce by Camper and Nicholson in the early 1900s.  Mr Shaw was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and after two years of racing (with unknown results) he sold her to Avery Jones of Bristol, the son of the mayor.  By 1902 she had been converted to cutter fig and renamed Samphire.  Fully restored and converted for charter in 1991 at the Bristol yard of Storms\u2019l Services\u2019 and fitted with Noble Marine spars, by 2010 she was sitti ng idle on the South Coast.  After another refit at the Bristol Classic Boat Company she was returned to a yawl rig and re-converted below to echo her elegance of form and her pedigree as a Victorian gentleman\u2019s racing yacht.  She was relaunched in 2017 and given her original name of Wayward.  In 2019 she was for sale.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.3528, "draft": 2.5908, "fore_triangle_base": 8.153499146549622, "fore_triangle_height": 16.45940014630578, "length_on_deck": 15.24, "length_on_waterline": 12.496951962935869, "length_over_all": 15.240185320653499, "main": {"foot": 7.315288953913679, "head": 5.7912704218483295, "luff": 6.705681541087539}, "mizzen": {"foot": 2.43842965130456, "luff": 6.0960741282613995}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 1.182300846, "topsail": {"luff": 7.315288953913679, "perpendicular": 3.8100463301633747}}, "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "006b3466-c4c7-4351-99fe-ba5b98e5234c", "launched": "1998-04-01", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "mssi": "235021661", "name": "Wayward", "oga_no": 3884, "ownerships": [{"name": "D Cook", "share": 64, "start": 2012}], "place_built": "Southampton", "previous_names": ["Samphire", "Wayward"], "reference": ["CB Aug 90", "CB Jul 91", "Classic Sailor Jan 2019"], "rig_type": "Yawl", "sail_number": "K3884T", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Wayward, a \u2018gentleman\u2019s yawl\u2019, was launched in 1898, having been commissioned by HT Shaw of Beaulieu.</p>", "uk_part1": "109275", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1898, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3884"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
