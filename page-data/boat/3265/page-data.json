They were built to be fast and with shallow\ndraft so they could net the catch and return quickly over the bar to gain the\nbest prices for their fish. Skippers of the bigger vessels nicknamed them 'picarooners'\n(derived from the Spanish/Portugese for pirates) as they were able to steal a\nprecious part of the trade!</p>\n<p>The Picarooner is the smallest of the Heard\nboats but sails like a much bigger vessel than her 15'6\".\nMallard was fitted out by David Sexton between 2011 and 2013. Malcom Goram increased\nthe rudder area, lengthened the bowsprit, adapted a 5hp outboard into a well and\nprovided a new suit of sails in 2016.
