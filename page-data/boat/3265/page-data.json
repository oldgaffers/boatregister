They were built to be fast and with shallow draft so they could net the catch and return quickly over the bar to gain the best prices for their fish. Skippers of the bigger vessels nicknamed them &#39;picarooners&#39; (derived from the Spanish/Portugese for pirates) as they were able to steal a precious part of the trade!<br />\r\nThe Picarooner is the smallest of the Heard boats but sails like a much bigger vessel than here 15&#39;6&quot;!<br />\r\nMallard was fitted out by David Sexton between 2011 &amp; 2013. Malcom Goram increased the rudder area, lengthened the bowsprit, adapted a 5hp outboard into a well and provided a new suit of sails in 2016. In 2017 she visited the Morbihan in Brittany.</p>", "generic_type": "Dayboat", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.8288, "calculated_thcf": 0.784, "draft": 0.3048, "draft_keel_down": 0.9144, "fore_triangle_base": 2.2342, "fore_triangle_height": 4.0386, "length_on_deck": 4.7244, "length_on_waterline": 4.4714, "length_over_spars": 5.4864, "length_overall": 4.7244, "main": {"foot": 10.33, "head": 8.42, "luff": 7.83}, "moving_keel": true, "moving_keel_type": "Centreboard"}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "504243bd-e0ce-462e-ad55-0eac5c1aba67", "image_key": "kwqT5T", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Mallard", "oga_no": 3265, "ownerships": [{"end": 2014, "note": "First owner David Sexton 2013-4", "start": 2013, "text": "First owner David Sexton"}, {"name": "Malcom Goram", "share": 64, "start": 2014}], "place_built": "Mylor", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "CP 6", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Mallard is a Clovelly Picarooner.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-KQN8vr5/0/Th/i-KQN8vr5-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1984, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3265"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
