Originally called <em>White Kitten</em>, after\na few years her name was changed to <em>Sparrow</em> and then as her registry had lapsed,\nand another boat had been named <em>Sparrow</em>, she was renamed <em>Rowspar</em> as an anagram.</p>\n<p>In 1984 <em>Rowspar</em> was sold to someone in Emsworth where she remained through\nseveral owners until 2012/13. She was totally restored in 1999 by Spence Mooney\nand Chidham Marine, to a very high standard, using the best materials and retaining\nthe traditional character. She is extremely strongly built, planked in pitch\npine on oak frames, with bronze fittings and hand-spliced stainless-steel rigging.\nShe has a beautiful interior with the cabin all lined out in teak. Unusually\nfor a boat of her size, she has good headroom of around 5'8'' in the\nmain cabin and a Taylors cooker with an oven.</p>\n<p>The cabin has two settee berths, a table, a sink, chart table with VHF &amp; GPS,\nand plenty of locker space. There is less headroom in the foc'sle which contains\nthe heads, sail storage space, hanging cupboard, more lockers and a third bunk.\nShe is very comfortable for cruising for 2 people or even 3.</p>\n<p>She is rigged as a gaff cutter with optional\ntopsail, and has a number of spare foresails. The cockpit is also beautifully\nfitted out in teak and is well-protected by coamings all round, and there is\nplenty of locker space here as well.John Hall bought her in November 2011 and\nkept her on a mooring in Bosham Channel in the summer of 2012. After wintering\nin Emsworth Yacht Harbour, she was then moored at Wicor Yacht Haven in Portsmouth\nHarbour. She has raced in the past under a previous owner who also took her to\nthe Fowey Classics.</p>\n<p>Until 2022 she was used mainly for cruising and OGA rallies\nin the Solent area. This classic gentleman's yacht, much admired wherever\nshe goes, has now been sold to sail on the Italian lakes.</p>", "generic_type": "Itchen Ferry", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.7432, "draft": 1.2954, "fore_triangle_base": 5.31, "fore_triangle_height": 6.7, "length_on_deck": 7.62, "length_on_waterline": 7.315288953913679, "length_over_all": 7.62, "length_over_spars": 9.4489148988, "main": {"foot": 4.851481346, "head": 3.8354608632, "luff": 4.749871982443306}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "folding"}, "sailarea": 43.926, "thcf": 0.92, "topsail": {"luff": 3.98785, "perpendicular": 2.13362594489149}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Portsmouth", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "569a5fd3-084f-40e1-a530-e49bd4b0c998", "image_key": "jLZ6Mk", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Rowspar", "oga_no": 682, "ownerships": [{"end": "?", "name": "Spence Moody", "share": 64, "start": "?"}, {"end": 2023, "id": 477, "member": 4610, "share": 32, "start": 2011}, {"end": 2023, "id": 1200, "member": 4610, "share": 32, "start": 2011}, {"end": 2007, "name": "David Still", "share": 64, "start": 2000}, {"end": 2011, "id": 502, "member": 4743, "start": 2007}], "place_built": "Lymington", "previous_names": ["Sparrow", "White Kitten"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "682", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p><em>Rowspar</em> is an Itchen Ferry yacht built in 1926 by Berthon Boat Co.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "uk_part1": "166822", "year": 1926, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/682"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
