She was kept at Lymington until the 1950s.<p>Originally called White Kitten, after a few years her name was changed to Sparrow and then as her registry had lapsed, and another boat had been named Sparrow, she was renamed Rowspar as an anagram.<p>In 1984 Rowspar was sold to someone in Emsworth where she remained through several owners until 2012/13. She was totally restored in 1999 by Spence Mooney and Chidham Marine, to a very high standard, using the best materials and retaining the traditional character. She is extremely strongly built, planked in pitch pine on oak frames, with bronze fittings and hand-spliced stainless-steel rigging. <p>She has a beautiful interior with the cabin all lined out in teak. Unusually for a boat of her size, she has good headroom of around 5’8” in the main cabin and a Taylors cooker with an oven.<p>The cabin has two settee berths, a table, a sink, chart table with VHF &amp; GPS, and plenty of locker space. There is less headroom in the foc&#39;sle which contains the heads, sail storage space, hanging cupboard, more lockers and a third bunk. She is very comfortable for cruising for 2 people or even 3.<p>She is rigged as a gaff cutter with optional topsail, and has a number of spare foresails. The cockpit is also beautifully fitted out in teak and is well-protected by coamings all round, and there is plenty of locker space here as well.<p>John Hall bought her in November 2011 and kept her on a mooring in Bosham Channel in the summer of 2012. After wintering in Emsworth Yacht Harbour, she was then moored at Wicor Yacht Haven in Portsmouth Harbour. She has raced in the past under a previous owner who also took her to the Fowey Classics. She is used mainly for cruising and OGA rallies in the Solent area, a classic gentleman’s yacht, much admired wherever she goes.","image_key":"jLZ6Mk","uk_part1":"166822","spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel  pitch pine on oak","draft":1.2954,"generic_type":"Itchen Ferry","handicap_data":{"beam":2.79403803950256,"main":{"foot":4.851481346013167,"head":3.8354608632040965,"luff":4.749871982443306},"thcf":0.92,"draft":1.2954218483296758,"topsail":{"luff":3.9878505242623747,"perpendicular":2.13362594489149},"sailarea":43.92606827628219,"propellor":{"type":"folding","blades":3},"length_over_all":7.620092660326749,"length_over_spars":9.44891489880517,"fore_triangle_base":5.308674713484515,"length_on_waterline":7.315288953913679,"fore_triangle_height":6.705681541087539},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.62,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"`Rowspar’ is an Itchen Ferry yacht built in 1926 by Berthon Boat Co.","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:38:49.422158+00:00","website":"","beam":2.7432,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"5a7f07fc-efa0-44ab-96d1-9cccf357aa2d","designer":"1371a2f2-2d48-41f8-a3de-03cf0ed4441c","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"L.A.
