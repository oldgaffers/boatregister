She was kept at\nLymington until the 1950s.Originally called <em>White Kitten</em>, after a few years\nher name was changed to <em>Sparrow</em> and then as her registry had lapsed, and\nanother boat had been named <em>Sparrow</em>, she was renamed <em>Rowspar</em> as an anagram.</p>\n<p>In 1984 <em>Rowspar</em> was sold to someone in Emsworth where she remained through\nseveral owners until 2012/13. She was totally restored in 1999 by Spence Mooney\nand Chidham Marine, to a very high standard, using the best materials and\nretaining the traditional character. She is extremely strongly built, planked in\npitch pine on oak frames, with bronze fittings and hand-spliced stainless-steel\nrigging. She has a beautiful interior with the cabin all lined out in teak.\nUnusually for a boat of her size, she has good headroom of around 5\u20198\u201d in the\nmain cabin and a Taylors cooker with an oven.</p>\n<p>The cabin has two settee berths, a table, a sink, chart table with VHF &amp; GPS,\nand plenty of locker space. There is less headroom in the foc'sle which contains\nthe heads, sail storage space, hanging cupboard, more lockers and a third bunk.\nShe is very comfortable for cruising for 2 people or even 3.</p>\n<p>She is rigged as a gaff cutter with optional topsail, and has a number of spare\nforesails. The cockpit is also beautifully fitted out in teak and is\nwell-protected by coamings all round, and there is plenty of locker space here\nas well.John Hall bought her in November 2011 and kept her on a mooring in\nBosham Channel in the summer of 2012. After wintering in Emsworth Yacht Harbour,\nshe was then moored at Wicor Yacht Haven in Portsmouth Harbour. She has raced in\nthe past under a previous owner who also took her to the Fowey Classics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until 2022 she was used mainly for cruising and OGA rallies in the Solent area.\nThis classic gentleman\u2019s yacht, much admired wherever she goes, has now been\nsold to sail on the Italian lakes.</p>", "generic_type": "Itchen Ferry", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.7432, "draft": 1.2954, "fore_triangle_base": 5.31, "fore_triangle_height": 6.7, "length_on_deck": 7.62, "length_on_waterline": 7.315288953913679, "length_over_all": 7.62, "length_over_spars": 9.4489148988, "main": {"foot": 4.851481346, "head": 3.8354608632, "luff": 4.749871982443306}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "folding"}, "sailarea": 43.926, "thcf": 0.92, "topsail": {"luff": 3.98785, "perpendicular": 2.13362594489149}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Portsmouth", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "569a5fd3-084f-40e1-a530-e49bd4b0c998", "image_key": "jLZ6Mk", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Rowspar", "oga_no": 682, "ownerships": [{"end": "?", "name": "Spence Moody", "share": 64, "start": "?"}, {"end": 2023, "id": 477, "member": 4610, "share": 32, "start": 2011}, {"end": 2023, "id": 1200, "member": 4610, "share": 32, "start": 2011}, {"end": 2007, "name": "David Still", "share": 64, "start": 2000}, {"end": 2011, "id": 502, "member": 4743, "start": 2007}], "place_built": "Lymington", "previous_names": ["Sparrow", "White Kitten"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "682", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>`Rowspar\u2019 is an Itchen Ferry yacht built in 1926 by Berthon Boat Co.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "uk_part1": "166822", "year": 1926, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/682"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
