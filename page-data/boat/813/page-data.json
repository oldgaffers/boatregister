In 1937 Uffa Fox was commissioned to design a boat suitable for estuary and coastal sailing.  He produced Vixen, to be light in weight and easily handled for beaching.

Large storage area below foredeck for camping equipment & use of cockpit tent allows 2 people to sleep on board.  Hull & deck have been completely restored over 3 years using the West epoxy resin saturation technique and is now completely impervious to the ingress of water.  Galvanised steel centre plate operated by Chinese windlass.  Tanned cotton mainsail, roller reefing genoa & ghoster plus larger mainsail & light weight spars for use in light airs.
