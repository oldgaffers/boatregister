He was a keen Old Gaffer\nracing man, who having sailed several types of gaffer decided he could design\nand build one better and faster. It took him 5 years and there is an album of\nphotographs that records the whole process. Time was not of the essence and\ngreat care was given to the construction and the detail work.</p>\n<p>The boat was built using West Epoxy System and BS 1088 marine ply, with teak\nlaid decks and teak and mahogany exterior fit out. The shape is very\nconventional with a long keel, straight stem, good freeboard and multichine. She\nhas\u00a0 a generous interior volume. She is fairly full mid-ships producing ample\nbuoyancy so she stands up to her canvas.</p>\n<p>The chines land on a full length internal stringer and there are a number of\nheavy laminated rig frames which span across the centre-line. The bulkheads at\nthe forward and after ends of the saloon are structural and epoxy bonded to the\nskin.</p>\n<p>Carved hanging knees either side of the doorway frame posts in the forward\nbulkhead and full ring frames in way all take the compression of the deck\nstepped mast. Laminated hanging knees on the cabin coamings in the main cabin\nand in the fore cabin in way of the forward end of the coach-roof all serve to\nstiffen that structure.</p>\n<p>She has a very sweet sheer rising gently aft emphasised by varnished rubbing\nstrakes top and bottom of the wide sheer strake. The forward and after ends of\nthe sheer strake have \"badges\" carved and picked out in paint against the\nvarnish. The fore foot is very square giving her grip in the water and\ndirectional stability and the transom has a delicate tumble-home to the upper\nedges. The transom-hung rudder has a step in it allowing someone in the water to\nclimb back aboard.</p>\n<p>Heavy galvanised steel centre-plate incorporated into the companionway step and\nstowed in the raised position within the depth of the wood keel. The plate is\nraised by a lanyard through a stainless steel pipe by the main sheet support.\nSeveral cast iron ballast blocks are secured in the bilge across the\ncentre-line.</p>\n<p>A relatively large, sealed cock-pit gives space for 4 crew. The cabin entrance\nwith sliding hatch and wash-boards has a sill at seat level. The deck is\nswept-laid in teak over a ply sub deck. The rig is set up with halyards led aft\nalong the coach-roof deck through clutches to a top-action Harken 9 winch each\nside of the entrance hatch. Jib and staysail sheets are lead through lead blocks\non deck tracks to jammers.</p>\n<p>Accommodation.- 3 berths</p>\n<p>Fore cabin with single berth to stbd. The feet of the berth reach forward under\nthe deck chain well.</p>\n<p>Saloon cabin. Port and starboard settee berths. Shaped, buttoned cushions.\nShaped bunk boards. Exposed varnished yacht sides.</p>\n<p>Fold down chart desk against the after bulkhead to stbd. A 2-bruner Origo spirit\nstove mounted on rails on the bulkhead over the end of the port berth slides\nacross to the centre-line against the companionway steps for use.</p>\n<p>Since purchase in 2015 works carried out include</p>\n<p>1) Hull repainted</p>\n<p>2) New mast and spars (Freelands)</p>\n<p>3) New standing and running rigging</p>\n<p>4) Sails refurbished and set up for Wykeham Martin</p>\n<p>5) Wykeham Martin on jib and staysail</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.362, "draft": 0.786, "fore_triangle_base": 3.429, "fore_triangle_height": 5.639, "last_modified": "2025-05-06T08:16:41.307Z", "length_on_deck": 6.959, "length_on_waterline": 6.477, "length_over_all": 6.959, "main": {"foot": 3.658, "head": 3.353, "luff": 3.658}, "propellor": {"type": "none"}, "solent": {"hull_shape": "Long keel - Low volume", "measured_rating": 19.494455039457506, "thcf": 0.927}, "thcf": 0.866}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Folly Reach", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "0824a7cb-dcf4-4093-8870-93b4adc6aaa7", "image_key": "3LpNhN", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Patience", "oga_no": 1990, "ownerships": [{"end": 2014, "name": "P Atkins", "share": 64, "start": 1991}, {"end": 2016, "name": "I Cantley", "share": 64, "start": 2015}, {"end": 2022, "id": 949, "member": 6146, "share": 64, "start": 2016}, {"current": true, "id": 35304, "member": 6813, "share": 64, "start": 2022}], "place_built": "Poole", "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "6166L", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>23' gaff cutter designed and built by first owner Peter Atkins of Poole and\nlaunched in 1993.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2025-05-19", "year": 1993, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/1990"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
