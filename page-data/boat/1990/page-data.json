He was a keen Old Gaffer racing man, who having sailed several types of gaffer decided he could design and build one better and faster. It took him 5 years and there is an album of photographs that records the whole process. Time was not of the essence and great care was given to the constructin and the detai work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boat was built using West Epoxy System and BS 1088 marine ply, with teak laid decks and teak and mahogany exterior fit out. The shape is very conventional with a long keel, straight stem, good freeboard and multichine. She has&nbsp; a generous interior volume. She is fairly full mid-ships producing ample buoyancy so she stands up to her canvas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chines land on a full length internal stringer and there are a number of heavy laminated rig frames which span across the centre-line. The bulkheads at the forward and after ends of the saloon are structural and epoxy bonded to the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Carved hanging knees either side of the doorway frame posts in the forward bulkhead and full ring frames in way all take the compression of the deck stepped mast. Laminated hanging knees on the cabin coamings in the main cabin and in the fore cabin in way of the forward end of the coach-roof all serve to stiffen that structure.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">She has a very sweet sheer rising gently aft emphasised by varnished rubbing strakes top and bottom of the wide sheer strake. The forward and after ends of the sheer strake have &quot;badges&quot; carved and picked out in paint against the varnish. The fore foot is very square giving her grip in the water and directional stability and the transom has a delicate tumble-home to the upper edges. The transom-hung rudder has a step in it allowing someone in the water to climb back aboard.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Heavy galvanised steel centre-plate incorporated into the companionway step and stowed in the raised position within the depth of the wood keel. The plate is raised by a lanyard through a stainless steel pipe by the main sheet support. Several cast iron ballast blocks are secured in the bilge across the centre-line.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">A relatively large, sealed cock-pit gives space for 4 crew. The cabin entrance with sliding hatch and wash-boards has a sill at seat level. The deck is swept-laid in teak over a ply sub deck. The rig is set up with halyards led aft along the coach-roof deck through clutches to a top-action Harken 9 winch each side of the entrance hatch. Jib and staysail sheets are lead through lead blocks on deck tracks to jammers.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Accommodation.- 3 berths</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Fore cabin with single berth to stbd. The feet of the berth reach forward under the deck chain well.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Saloon cabin. Port and starboard settee berths. Shaped, buttoned cushions. Shaped bunk boards. Exposed varnished yacht sides.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Fold down chart desk against the after bulkhead to stbd. A 2-bruner Origo spirit stove mounted on rails on the bulkhead over the end of the port berth slides across to the centre-line against the companionway steps for use.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Since purchase in 2015 works carried out include</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">1) Hull repainted</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">2) New mast and spars (Freelands)</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">3) New standing and running rigging</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">4) Sails refurbished and set up for Wykeham Martin</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">5) Wykeham Martin on jib and staysail</font></font></p>","image_key":"3LpNhN","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"plywood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"West System Marine Ply","draft":0.7864,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.286027798098025,"main":{"foot":3.6576444769568397,"head":3.3528407705437697,"luff":3.6576444769568397},"thcf":0.870332415,"draft":0.8138258961228968,"length_over_all":6.958668617410387,"fore_triangle_base":3.429041697147037,"length_on_waterline":6.4770787612777365,"fore_triangle_height":5.6388685686417945},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.9586,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>23' gaff cutter designed and built by first owner Peter Atkins of Poole and launched in 1993.</p>","updated_at":"2021-09-06T19:05:24.569458+00:00","website":"","beam":2.3622,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"ace7bd86-4eec-4ec5-8695-ef66dfb468f2","designer":"b8a2eff0-225e-40f4-9335-43d1055c0735","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"plywood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"P.
