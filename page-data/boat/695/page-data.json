The Tamarisk 22 was\nthe forerunner of the Tamarisk 24, and based on a hull mould taken from the\nItchen Ferry \u2018Nellie\u201d. We know of one other Tamarisk 22, \u2018Scandal\u2019 kept at Dell\nQuay in Chichester Harbour, previously owned by OGA Member Max Manning. * There\nmay have been a few more 22s but the Tamarisk 24 is the most common version. See\nTamarisk website\n<a href=\"http://www.tamarisk-gaffers.co.uk/\">www.tamarisk-gaffers.co.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>East Breeze was purchased around 1993 by David and Helen Barr (who live near\nChichester) from Maldon on the Blackwater River on the East Coast. They sailed\nher from the east coast down to Chichester Harbour and kept her at Langstone.\nThey later kept her on a mooring at Itchenor and had her in Birdham Pool one\nwinter.</p>\n<p>The Barrs sailed her a lot until their two daughters were born. They once took\nher across to France with two friends, taking 15 hours to get there and 22 to\nget back. After they had the children, they found it more difficult to sail.\nEast Breeze was put up for sale and was ashore in Thornham Marina for some time,\nuntil John Hilsden bought her in November 2002 in a dilapidated condition. The\nBarr family have recently joined the OGA and now have a Drascombe lugger which\nthey bring all the way to YOGAFF. They were very interested to see East Breeze\nagain when we met them at Yogaff a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>Jon Hilsden had the engine rebuilt by John Cutler the marine engineer, and then\nmoved her to Cowes, Isle of Wight. He carried out quite a lot of work, such as\nstripping out the interrior accommodation to make it open plan, new running\nrigging, repairs to ply deck and glassing over the side decks and cockpit seats,\ninstalling a Taylors heater. John Hilsden then got a job in France, so he put\nEast Breeze up for sale and moved her to Dolphin Quay, Emsworth in 2004.</p>\n<p>John Hall bought East Breeze in March 2005. The varnish and paintwork was in\npoor condition, arrangements for cleating the sheets &amp; halyards were very basic\nand the interior unfinished, with no bunk cushions and an ancient cooker. There\nwas only one battery, so this was replaced and a second battery added with a\nswitch so that engine &amp; domestic electrical supply is separate. In additional to\npainting and varnishing, John Hall has carried out the following improvements:</p>\n<p>Finished new interior layout including a chart table; replaced part of ply\nbulkhead and cabin side, new cockpit sole and bearers. New bunk cushions with\nfabric covers. New Plastimo Neptune cooker; completely new gas system with gas\ndetector alarm; gas bottle moved to safer position on foredeck. New Portapotti\nchemical toilet and tap for stainless steel sink bowl. Installed GPS, replaced\nVHF radio. Halyards and sheets changed to non-stretch multiplait, most blocks\nreplaced in Tufnol with jammers for sheets. Pin-rail for belaying halyards and a\nboom crutch. New canvas full length boat cover and small vinyl cockpit cover.</p>\n<p>East Breeze has been sailed locally, either in Chichester Harbour or over to\nBembridge. Longer trips have been to Yogaff 3 times and various harbours in the\nSolent.</p>\n<p>*Scandal has her own entry in the Boat Register and is now located in France.</p>\n<p>Marion Shirley bought East Breeze from John and Liz Hall in late 2011 and\ndelivered her from Emsworth to her new mooring at Kemps Quay in Southampton in\nMarch 2012. \u00a0Marion adapted the rigging for single handed sailing by leading the\nmain halyards back to the cockpit and adding \u00a0jib blocks made by Tim Aspden. She\nreplaced the anchor chain with multiplait and reorganised the main sheet\narrangement, reefing and running backstays. She attended to all the rigging\nrequirements of the 2012 insurance survey. Marion sailed East Breeze to the\nBeaulieu River, Marchwood Yacht Club, Newtown Creek, Island Harbour, Wootton\nCreek, Lymington, and Yarmouth.</p>\n<p>In 2013 Ian Macgillivray, professional boat builder of Bluff\u2019s Quay, Southampton\nadvised and assisted in stripping and sheathing \u00a0the foredeck. This was then\npainted with two part polyurethane primer and International Toplac. He also\nreplaced the starboard side of the forecabin by means of a scarphe joint. The\nforedeck cleats were replaced and fitted with cushions below decks and some\nfittings regalvanised. The bobstay fittings were bolted rather than screwed to\nthe boat. Ian also built the housing allowing the bowsprit to be run in to the\nboat. Marion sailed East Breeze to Yarmouth, Portsmouth and Bembridge. East\nBreeze was present at Cowes for the 50th anniversary of the Old Gaffers\nAssociation.</p>\n<p>In spring 2014, Marion removed the quarter round beading from cockpit and side\ndecks and Ian continued the programme of rebuild and improvement by removing the\ncabin sides from East Breeze and peeling away all the sheathing from side decks\nand cockpit. Considerable water ingress and rot was discovered. The port side\ndeck was totally replaced as were the cockpit and cabin sides, all the cockpit\nflat areas, the stern deck, the bridge deck, starboard and stern inwhales and\ninternal sternpost. Teak corner posts were added in the cock pit and forward and\naft in the cabin. The cabin roof, side decks, stern deck and cockpit flats were\nsheathed and repainted with two part epoxy primer and two part top coat. A new\nlocker was constructed and tiling added to allow the installation of a Taylor\u2019s\ndiesel heater, the water supply relocated to below the chart table and the boat\ncompletely rewired with new batteries, cabin lights, log and echo sounder, an\nadditional mini-contest compass and 12v sockets. Tufnell winches were installed\nand all works required and recommended by the 2012 insurance survey were\ncompleted. Spinlock jammers were installed to aid luff tension.</p>\n<p>Marion sailed East Breeze to the Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival then to the OGA\nBembridge Rally and onwards, single handed, to the Dutch Old Gaffers Cross\nCountry Tour, crossing the Channel from Dover to Dunkerque. She sailed 809\nnautical miles in total and was away just under two months, crossing back from\nDunkerque to Dover and on to Brighton and East Cowes in an engine assisted\npassage.</p>\n<p>The original engine, a Yanmar SE8 gave trouble on this voyage by not starting\nwhen warm and was found to have a cracked cylinder head, probably due to intake\nof particles which impeded water supply for cooling. A replacement head was\nsourced and fitted for the 2015 season. In this season, Marion sailed East\nBreeze to the Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival, the Gaffers' Poole Rally and the\nAnnual Rally at Cowes and Haslar. Also to Ryde and on a week's tour of creeks\nand rivers of The Solent taking in the Beaulieu River, Newtown, Newport, Wootton\nand Haslar.</p>\n<p>In March 2016, East Breeze was once again at Bluff's Quay. Ian removed the\nstarboard side cockpit upright and floor, and the YSE8 engine. Marion cleaned\nand painted the bilges prior to the installation of a Beta 14 engine and\nreplacement of the wooen parts including a cockpit floor and hatch.</p>\n<p>Marion sailed East Breeze to the Medina River and then in stormy conditions\nunder three reefs to the Yarmouth Gaffers regatta. About two weeks later, Marion\nand East Breeze left the Solent via Yarmouth, sailed to Alderney, on to Guernsey\nand thence to Treguier. They continued by way of Perros Guirec, Roscoff,\nL'Aberwrach and Isle Molene to Camaret where crew Mary Gibbs joined the ship.\nThey continued to the Brest Festival and onwards to the Douarnenez festival,\nsuffering a collapse of the backstays and gaff halyard. This was replaced at\nDouarnenez with help from Janet and Mike Gurney in Passager. Marion, Mary and\nEast Breeze returned via Camaret to L'Aberwrach, Roscoff and Morlaix where Mary\nleft by train to rejoin her own ship. Marion continued to Trebeurden, the\nTreguier River, Pontrieux and Lezardrieux before crossing the channel to\nGuernsey, Alderney and Yarmouth prior to joining a the Solent Gaffers in the\nBeaulieu River at Ginns Farm.</p>\n<p>In 2017 following routine maintenance, and the customary early season Solent\nGaffers events, Marion sailed East Breeze to The Folly and on to Weymouth. She\ncrossed Lyme Bay to the River Exe, spent a night on a buoy and then visited\nTopsham. She sailed by way of Brixham to Dartmouth, anchoring in the river and\nleaving East Breeze in Dartmouth whilst joining the Classic Channel Regatta. She\nrejoined East Breeze and sailed her to Salcombe and then to Fowey, returning to\nPlymouth to explore the harbour and Tamar River before joining the Gaffers Sou\nb' Sou' West Rally at Plymouth. She sailed in company to Salcombe and back to\nDartmouth, visiting Totnes in rain and cold before joining the South West\nGaffers Dittisham Rally. She then returned in company to Weymouth and to\nYarmouth. The passage to Yarmouth was windier than forecast and East Breeze's\nmainsail disintegrated en route. Marion met former owners, the Barrs, in\nYarmouth and enjoyed discussing the history of repairs and improvements to East\nBreeze. In late September, Marion sailed East Breeze to Lymington where she was\nmeasured for a new main by Pete Sanders who confirmed that the damaged sail was\nthe original at 40+ years old. Marion made a new winter cover for East Breeze in\nlate 2017.</p>\n<p>Following maintenance, the addition of mast storage gear made by David Pennison\nand with a new mainsail, Marion gave up her berth in Southampton. 2018 sailing\nbegan on Friday 25th May when Marion joined Sally and Tony on Step Back in Time\nfor a pre-Yarmouth cruise to the Folly, Bucklers Hard and Lymington Town Quay.\nFollowing the Yarmouth festival, Marion anchored at Alum Bay to take the new ebb\nto Weymouth. This year, the trip west was quick with stops in Weymouth, round\nthe Bill to West Bay, thence to Dartmouth, Newton Ferrars and straight to\nFalmouth. Here the competitors in the revived Golden Globe race were preparing\ntheir boats. East Breeze shared a pontoon with iconic single handers Suhaili\nwith RKJ on board and Gypsy Moth 4 and saw the competitors depart for France and\nthe start of the race proper. Marion took East Breeze up the Fal and dried out\nin Truro then attended the SW Gaffers Helford Rally with Richard Shirley. She\nretreated to Porthnavas Creek and Gweek during bad weather then visited Fowey,\nDandy Hole and Mayflower Marina before joining the SW Gaffers again at Plymouth\nYacht Haven. She returned to Fowey for the Classics then took East Breeze up the\nTamar to Calstock and a temporary mooring. On 30th July, Marion slipped Calstock\nand returned to Dartmouth via Mayflower Marina. Marion slipped Dartmouth at 0925\nhrs on 01 August, moored in Portland Marina at 2110 hrs continued to Newtown,\narriving back at The Folly on Friday, 3rd August. East Breeze was in Haslar\nMarina on Sunday 6th August, returning to The Folly in convoy with Molly\nCobbler. The OGA55 small boat and main celebrations followed and East Breeze had\na major professional engine service.</p>\n<p>On 22 August, she was back in Weymouth where Marion was joined by Mike Forwood.\nEast Breeze left Weymouth at 0100 hours on 28th August, passed east of Alderney\nthrough the early race and berthed on the visitors' pontoon in Guernsey at 1950\nhours, a 91 mile motor assisted passage. Marion and Mike anchored at Beauport in\nJersey and continued to St Malo, Port des bas Sables. From 2nd September, Mike\nand Marion transited the Canal d\u2019Ille et Rance, dropping the mast at Dinan and\nstopping at Evran, Tinteniac (8 locks), St Medard (20 locks), St Martin\n(Rennes), St Cyr (Rennes) - not recommended, Gaileau, Guipry, Besle. They\narrived at Redon, visitors\u2019 pontoon on Tuesday, 11th September where East Breeze\nwas lifted out and stored. About 889 miles achieved.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.438, "draft": 0.914, "fore_triangle_base": 3.658, "fore_triangle_height": 6.553, "length_on_deck": 6.706, "length_on_waterline": 6.401, "length_over_all": 6.706, "main": {"foot": 3.962, "head": 3.581, "luff": 3.962}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.86522172}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Southampton", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "debfe1e8-5ac3-4153-bd4b-d6f8117923d8", "image_key": "WP6FjB", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "East Breeze", "oga_no": 695, "ownerships": [{"name": "", "note": "Purchased around 1993 by David and Helen Barr.
