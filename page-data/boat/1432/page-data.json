He took her\non a voyage in 1938 just before Hitler invaded Poland. She was ordered off the\nwater while cruising along the East coast, spending the war years inland behind\nLowestoft.</p>\n<p>She was purchased by Lady Claude Hamilton and refitted with luxurious\naccommodation  and  renamed \"Kenya Jacaranda\" she was copper clad to the\nwaterline and other changes appropriate for activity in warm tropical waters\nthis never transpired and she was moved to the Hamble after the war and was\nnever used again</p>\n<p>What we know for certain is that, in 1949, still copper clad and still owned by\nLady Hamilton she was wallowing in mud in a creek near Southampton. Rescued from\nthe Hamble she went into service on the Thames, training Sea Cadets in 1951.</p>\n<p>KJ had taken some 4000 young people to sea between 1951 and 1979 when she was\nsqueezed out of her London berths by Docklands developments. At the same time\nthe Bermondsey Sea Cadets were finding it almost impossible to maintain her.</p>\n<p>The ship was moved 'temporarily' to Tilbury Dock in 1980 re-grouped as the\n\"Mayflower Sail Training Society\" and carried on more or less as before,\nenabling youngsters from deprived areas of Greater London to sail a traditional\nsailing vessel at an affordable price. She was based   in Tilbury for over 30\nyears.</p>\n<p>Between 1980 and 2006, Kenya Jacaranda 'enabled' some 3000 young people (and an\nunknown number of adults) to get afloat. She competed in the Brixham Trawler\nRace at least twice, with MSTS crew. The Mayflower Sail Training Society was\ndisbanded in 2007, and a new charity was formed to look after her \u201cKenya\nJackaranda Heritage Sailing\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2014 with a lack of funding she was in the process of being transferred to\nTrinity Sailing in Brixham to be rebuilt with the help of a Lottery Grant,\nunfortunately this application was withdrawn after an initial grant and the\nfuture of the vessel was then unsure, Tilbury Docks wanted the vessel removed\nand a temporary home was offered  in Maldon and she was moved to the River\nBlackwater up to Downs Road Boatyard on the 15<sup>th</sup> June 2014</p>\n<p>After some time of an uncertain future the charity was handed over and renamed\nHeritage Marine Foundation</p>\n<p>She is now in a poor state of repair and kept afloat with pumps while her future\nrestoration is being organised.</p>", "generic_type": "Brixham Trawler", "handicap_data": {"beam": 5.7, "draft": 2.896, "length_on_deck": 23.47, "length_on_waterline": 21.032, "length_over_all": 23.47}, "hin": "BM 163", "home_port": "Maldon", "hull_form": "cut away stern", "id": "4818a78f-f9e2-4d4b-b113-518f0c2b2ccf", "image_key": "g5MGt9", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Torbay Lass", "nhsr": 95, "oga_no": 1432, "ownerships": [{"name": "Paul Ladyman", "share": 64, "start": 2012}], "place_built": "Brixham", "previous_names": ["Kenya Jacaranda"], "rig_type": "Ketch", "sail_number": "BM163", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p><em>Torbay Lass</em> - formerly <em>Kenya Jacaranda</em> - built in 1923.
