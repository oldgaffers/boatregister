The East Coast is a wonderful cruising area and\nI wonder now why it took so long before I made the effort to visit. The people\nare kindness itself, the scenery is beautiful, the waterways exciting to navigate,\nand the pubs fun. Every waterway has somewhere to anchor, and always seems to\nhave two rivers conveniently attached and at different angles so there is always\na sheltered anchorage.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank the\nperson who so kindly ran down the banks of the Crouch trying to get my attention\nto say that a free berth had been arranged up river; sadly I was looking the other\nway. It would have saved me from the interesting experience of a full ebb and\na strong contrary sea breeze leading down to the Spitway!</p>\n<p>I was amazed by how many Thames Barges are still plying these waters.\nI think I counted 16. Seeing them sailing is the most wonderful sight. I witnessed\nsome marvellous seamanship and my congratulations to all those skippers. We had\na great lunchtime <code>lock-in\u2019 at the Manningtree Yacht Club (Constable\ncountry); thank you Steve and John. I have to admit to anchoring *Lucy*\nat Orford and catching a lift with those wiley</code>grand parents\u2019 Tim\nand Liz Dodwell up to Snape. They were to continue on through the Netherlands\nand up the Baltic to winter the boat in Marienhamm in Finland; a great adventure\nand good example of adventure to us all.</p>\n<p>We were blessed with offshore winds for most of the time which allowed easy access to\nthe Rivers Ore and Deben. Southwold Regatta was a memorable weekend with great\nweather and entertainment. The local brewery was extremely generous in its prizes\nand I am not quite sure what race it was that Lucy won, but 35 pints of Adnams\nbest bitter was dutifully carried onboard and shipped across the North Sea for\ndispensing at the Hellevoetsluis Regatta (probably wangled by Jon so that he would\nnot run dry of his best tipple!!).</p>\n<p>Thank you again East Coast; it was a great example of how to host a visiting Gaffer.
