The East Coast is a wonderful cruising area and I wonder now why it took so long before I made the effort to visit. The people are kindness itself, the scenery is beautiful, the waterways exciting to navigate, and the pubs fun. Every waterway has somewhere to anchor, and always seems to have two rivers conveniently attached and at different angles so there is always a sheltered anchorage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I would like to thank the person who so kindly ran down the banks of the Crouch trying to get my attention to say that a free berth had been arranged up river; sadly I was looking the other way. It would have saved me from the interesting experience of a full ebb and a strong contrary sea breeze leading down to the Spitway!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I was amazed by how many Thames Barges are still plying these waters. I think I counted 16. Seeing them sailing is the most wonderful sight. I witnessed some marvellous seamanship and my congratulations to all those skippers. We had a great lunchtime &lsquo;lock- in&rsquo; at the Manningtree Yacht Club (Constable country); thank you Steve and John. I have to admit to anchoring &#39;Lucy&#39; at Orford and catching a lift with those wiley &lsquo;grand parents&rsquo; Tim and Liz Dodwell up to Snape. They were to continue on through the Netherlands and up the Baltic to winter the boat in Marienhamm in Finland; a great adventure and good example of adventure to us all.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We were blessed with offshore winds for most of the time which allowed easy access to the Rivers Ore and Deben. Southwold Regatta was a memorable weekend with great weather and entertainment. The local brewery was extremely generous in its prizes and I am not quite sure what race it was that Lucy won, but 35 pints of Adnams best bitter was dutifully carried onboard and shipped across the North Sea for dispensing at the Hellevoetsluis Regatta (probably wangled by Jon so that he would not run dry of his best tipple!!).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Thank you again East Coast; it was a great example of how to host a visiting Gaffer. Memorable days.</blockquote>","image_key":"GgdcHM","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"GRP hull with plywood coachroof and deck","draft":1.2192,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.43842965130456,"main":{"foot":4.368861253352841,"head":3.2766581321628867,"luff":3.6576444769568397},"thcf":0.912,"draft":1.21921482565228,"topsail":{"luff":4.648262618873445,"perpendicular":1.9812362838332114},"sailarea":41.6499691269796,"length_over_all":7.010485247500609,"length_over_spars":10.66812972445745,"fore_triangle_base":5.89287978541819,"length_on_waterline":6.705681541087539,"fore_triangle_height":7.874116069251402},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.0104,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Previously known as &#39;Lucy&#39;, and built by Martin Heard in 1985 she has sailed extensively, visiting Brest in 1992, 1996 and 2004, Holland in 1997 and 2005 and several Falmouth Festivals.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-31T17:02:52.218052+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"ee814a69-d5ad-46d9-88a9-a0598ae6d33b","designer":"7ac480da-7d09-4dd7-9c89-61199ff30913","design_class":"6f0aa06a-98b0-4764-8e61-d789bcfb63f0","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Heard 23"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Percy Dalton"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Martin Heard"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
