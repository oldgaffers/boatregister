I first started sailing in Morecambe Bay from 1925-1939, and during the war worked in an aircraft works at Hamble near Southampton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1947-1975 I sailed Sea Breeze around the Solent and rebuilt her twice during that time. From 1975 I have been enjoying the Falmouth area for sailing. My accounts for Sea Breeze cover 40 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was owned by a Hamble yacht skipper from 1920-1962, when I bought her from him for the value of the lead keel, which we estimated to be &pound;35. I had a new hollow spruce mast made in 1963, for &pound;50, and fitted an ancient Coventry Victor petrol engine, 50 years old, and a gift. A new propeller was obtained for &pound;6. In 1966 when I obtained my Post War Credits I purchased a new suit of terylene sails for &pound;135 from Williams, at Hamble, and a good second-hand pram dinghy for &pound;5 in 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972 I underwent heart surgery at Southampton, which meant a change to electric starting for the engine, a new Dynastart was obtained for &pound;54. In 1975 I left Hampshire for Cornwall, Sea Breeze was transported from Hamble to Mylor for &pound;95. She was lifted from the transporter into Mylor Creek for &pound;10.74, we bought the mooring with Sea Breeze, and she was collected from Mylor, and laid in Percuil River for us for &pound;35.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yearly expenditure: 1975-80 approx. &pound;87, 1980 &pound;74.02, 1981 &pound;150.49, 1982&nbsp; &pound;82.57, 1983 &pound;129.00, 1984 &pound;124.00, 1985 &pound;76.88, 1986 &pound;210.1,7 1987 &pound;98.00. This does not include food and petrol etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wonder if anyone gets cheaper sailing than this.</p>","image_key":"xJQPFc","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":0,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.43842965130456,"length_over_all":7.315288953913679,"length_on_waterline":7.315288953913679},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.3152,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Sea Breeze won 2nd Prize in the first Gaffers Race, Solent, 27 July 1959.
