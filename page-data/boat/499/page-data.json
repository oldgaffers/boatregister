I first started sailing in Morecambe Bay from 1925-1939, and during the war worked in an aircraft works at Hamble near Southampton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1947-1975 I sailed Sea Breeze around the Solent and rebuilt her twice during that time. From 1975 I have been enjoying the Falmouth area for sailing. My accounts for Sea Breeze cover 40 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was owned by a Hamble yacht skipper from 1920-1962, when I bought her from him for the value of the lead keel, which we estimated to be &pound;35. I had a new hollow spruce mast made in 1963, for &pound;50, and fitted an ancient Coventry Victor petrol engine, 50 years old, and a gift. A new propeller was obtained for &pound;6. In 1966 when I obtained my Post War Credits I purchased a new suit of terylene sails for &pound;135 from Williams, at Hamble, and a good second-hand pram dinghy for &pound;5 in 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972 I underwent heart surgery at Southampton, which meant a change to electric starting for the engine, a new Dynastart was obtained for &pound;54. In 1975 I left Hampshire for Cornwall, Sea Breeze was transported from Hamble to Mylor for &pound;95. She was lifted from the transporter into Mylor Creek for &pound;10.74, we bought the mooring with Sea Breeze, and she was collected from Mylor, and laid in Percuil River for us for &pound;35.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yearly expenditure: 1975-80 approx. &pound;87, 1980 &pound;74.02, 1981 &pound;150.49, 1982&nbsp; &pound;82.57, 1983 &pound;129.00, 1984 &pound;124.00, 1985 &pound;76.88, 1986 &pound;210.1,7 1987 &pound;98.00. This does not include food and petrol etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wonder if anyone gets cheaper sailing than this.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.4384, "length_on_deck": 7.3152, "length_on_waterline": 7.315288953913679, "length_over_all": 7.315288953913679}, "id": "bc08a675-6789-41a3-974d-6c28151ee1c8", "image_key": "xJQPFc", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Sea Breeze", "oga_no": 499, "ownerships": [{"end": 1994, "name": "Stan Lindsey-Wood", "share": 64, "start": 1947}], "place_built": "Newport IOW", "rig_type": "Sloop", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Sea Breeze won 2nd Prize in the first Gaffers Race, Solent, 27 July 1959.
