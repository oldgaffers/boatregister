About a dozen of these were\nmade from 1999, led by the late John Qualtrough Snr. All but two of these boats\nwere gaff-rigged to sail and race in Castletown Bay - with the original mast\nheight limited to be able to just float in and out of Castletown harbour under\nthe footbridge at minimum depth. Benbow was re-built from March 2021,\nre-launched in its present form in April 2022. The rig is an old National 18'\nProctor F-section mast and boom from about 1985 - a foot-shorter than the\nmaximum N18 mast with a slightly longer boom than standard. The 1985 sails were\nreplaced in 2025, using \"Squib\" material for the mainsail - at least the colour\nlooks traditional! Doesn't go under that bridge any more, of course...It has\nturned out to be a great dayboat - stiff enough for full rig up to moderate airs\nwith 300 kgs of ballast between the 90kg centreboard and 210kgs of lead under\nthe sole. Far too heavy and old-fashioned to exceed its hull-speed but reefed,\nit's superb.</p>", "generic_type": ["Dayboat"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.134, "draft": 0.457, "length_on_deck": 5.791, "length_on_waterline": 5.791, "thcf": "-"}, "hin": "IOM leisure-boat register no. 3328", "home_country": "Isle of Man", "home_port": "Port St Mary", "hull_form": "centre-boarder", "image_key": "t3gR4C", "lastModified": "2025-11-26T23:11:17Z", "mainsail_type": "bermudan", "name": "Benbow", "oga_no": 3794, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "name": "Mick Kneale", "share": 64, "start": 2025}], "place_built": "Castletown, Isle of Man", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "3328", "short_description": "<p>1999 GRP version of a small work-boat built 1905.</p>", "spar_material": "aluminium", "uk_part1": "IOM 3328", "updated_at": "2025-11-28", "year": 1999, "year_of_build": {"value": 1999}}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3794"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
