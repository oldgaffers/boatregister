Before we owned her \u00a0the cabin top\nhad been widened to give better sitting space below, a \u00a0bowsprit had been added\nso she could be sailed as a cutter or a sloop \u00a0with her large jib from the\nbowsprit end, her iron internal ballast had \u00a0been changed for lead and her\noriginal Brit petrol engine changed for a Yanmar GM10. When we bought <em>Margret\nAnn</em> in January (some years ago)she had a berth at Shamrock Quay on the Itchen.\nThe fees had been paid up to the March so we sailed her from there most weekends\nuntil March. We thoroughly enjoyed it in spite of the cold (we had a Tilley lamp\nwhich kept us warm in the evenings and slept with two sleeping bags each and\nwoolly hats).</p>\n<p>We then found rot in the cabin top so had to start doing her up. We had sold a\nprevious boat in the meantime but unfortunately bought yet another one (built in\n1910) which we are still \u00a0doing up. We're afraid that as a result <em>Margaret</em> Ann\nhas been neglected for a number of years so really needs a new owner to finish\nthe work so she can go sailing again.</p>\n<p>We completely removed the cabin and deck, stripped and repainted the \u00a0inside,\nrepaired several timbers by scarfing in new pieces, fitted two new deck beams,\nnew half beams and carlins, new hanging and quarter \u00a0knees and laid a new\ntongue-and-groove pitch pine deck, to be covered in \u00a0canvas.We\u2019ve also replaced\nthe top of the transom and the top edge of the sheer strake and fitted a new\nsamson post. We haven\u2019t used any laminated timber, epoxy or plywood.All the\npieces have been well painted and luted with white lead paste before assembly,\nso other than having silicon bronze screws where Hillyard's had used galvanised\nnails she's been redone in the way she was built.</p>\n<p>Most if not all of the cockpit and cabin wood work should be able to be\nrefurbished and used again. She still has all her original fittings for \u00a0deck,\ncockpit etc. together with new replacements for some of them. The \u00a0four\nportlights have been refurbished. She has an imitation CQR and a fisherman\nanchor and chain cable. The major work to be carried out is the re-construction\nof the coachhouse and cockpit coamings and coachhouse deck (the beams for this\ncould be reused). She comes complete with the timber (mahogany for the coamings\nand pitch pine for the cabin deck) to do this.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.981, "calculated_thcf": 0.81, "draft": 0.914, "fore_triangle_base": 2.53, "fore_triangle_height": 5.029, "length_on_deck": 5.639, "length_on_waterline": 5.334, "length_over_all": 5.639, "length_over_spars": 6.096, "length_overall": 5.486, "main": {"foot": 4.115, "head": 3.2, "luff": 2.591}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.828817333}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Kingsbridge", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "824acb22-665e-4e09-b2d3-cdc1773c6fda", "image_key": "8t7FFL", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Margaret Ann", "oga_no": 1173, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 9, "member": 1377, "share": 32, "start": 2001}, {"current": true, "id": 1106, "member": 1377, "share": 32, "start": 2001}], "place_built": "Littlehampton", "reference": ["Classic Boat November 2009 p.64"], "rig_type": "Sloop", "selling_status": "for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Margaret Ann is a Hillyard 2 1/2 tonner built in 1939</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2024-12-17", "website": "https://tinyurl.com/46vdcysy", "year": 1939, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/1173"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
