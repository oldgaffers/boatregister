Before we owned her &nbsp;the cabin top had been widened to give better sitting space below, a &nbsp;bowsprit had been added so she could be sailed as a cutter or a sloop &nbsp;with her large jib from the bowsprit end, her iron internal ballast had &nbsp;been changed for lead and her original Brit petrol engine changed for a Yanmar GM10. When we bought <em>Margret Ann</em> in January (some years ago)she had a berth at Shamrock Quay on the Itchen. The fees had been paid up to the March so we sailed her from there most weekends until March. We thoroughly enjoyed it in spite of the cold (we had a Tilley lamp which kept us warm in the evenings and slept with two sleeping bags each and woolly hats).</p>\n<p>Wethen found rot in the cabin top so had to start doing her up. We had sold a previous boat in the meantime but unfortunately bought yet another one (built in 1910) which we are still &nbsp;doing up. We're afraid that as a result <em>Margaret </em>Ann has been neglected for a number of years so really needs a new owner to finish the work so she can go sailing again.</p>\n<p>We completely removed the cabin and deck, stripped and repainted the &nbsp;inside, repaired several timbers by scarfing in new pieces, fitted two new deck beams, new half beams and carlins, new hanging and quarter &nbsp;knees and laid a new tongue-and-groove pitch pine deck, to be covered in &nbsp;canvas.We’ve also replaced the top of the transom and the top edge of the sheer strake and fitted a new samson post. We haven’t used any laminated timber, epoxy or plywood.All the pieces have been well painted and luted with white lead paste before assembly, so other than having silicon bronze screws where Hillyard's had used galvanised nails she's been redone in the way she was built.</p>\n<p>Most if not all of the cockpit and cabin wood work should be able to be &nbsp;refurbished and used again. She still has all her original fittings for &nbsp;deck, cockpit etc. together with new replacements for some of them. The &nbsp;four portlights have been refurbished. She has an imitation CQR and a fisherman anchor and chain cable. The major work to be carried out is the re-construction of the coachhouse and cockpit coamings and coachhouse deck (the beams for this could be reused). She comes complete with the timber (mahogany for the coamings and pitch pine for the cabin deck) to do this.</p>","image_key":"8t7FFL","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":1.9812240916849548,"main":{"foot":4.114850036576445,"head":3.2004389173372347,"luff":2.590831504511095},"thcf":0.828817333,"draft":0.9144111192392099,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":5.6388685686417945,"fore_triangle_base":2.529870763228481,"length_on_waterline":5.334064862228725,"fore_triangle_height":5.029261155815655},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.6388,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Margaret Ann is a Hillyard 2 1/2 tonner built in 1939</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:39:03.705659+00:00","website":"","beam":1.9812,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"d649c6a5-3acc-4f60-868f-7415641908a4","designer":"775a13f5-28e1-433f-bec0-2ad3d271ca6b","design_class":"5be1e6db-e482-4704-a65e-8d2e7e8d3772","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"2 1/2 Tonner"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"David Hillyard"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Sloop"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"David Hillyard"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":0}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
