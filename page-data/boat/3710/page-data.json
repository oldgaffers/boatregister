These are a very common sight in Greece, making up a good percentage of the small boat fishing fleet there. However, Eleni is a real rarity in that she was built explicitly as a sailing boat, unlike today's working τρεχαντήρια, which are all motorboats.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>She was built over the course of 7 years by amateur boat-builder Hans-Henrik Jørgensen in the north of Denmark, and launched in 2001. Hans-Henrik had a passion for Greek boats and based his design on a sponge-fishing boat built around 1930 but, in consultation with Kostas Damianidis, adapted the design to make it more suitable as a pure sailing boat.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Eleni's working boat forbears would have had little or no accommodation to copy from, so hers is much more in the Danish tradition than Greek - and none the worse for that! Below, she has a pilot berth beneath a lifting chart table plus a saloon berth to starboard, galley with Wallas stove, double seat and Blake head to port, and a double v-berth forward.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Between 2016 and 2018 Eleni was berthed in Maldon, where she had a new gaff cutter rig installed by TS Rigging, with sails by Jim Lawrence. A new Beta 50HP was also installed to replace a very elderly Perkins, along with various other improvements.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In 2018 Eleni made her second voyage to Greece, and currently lives in Preveza in the Ionian, where she feels very much at home.</p>\n<p><br></p>","image_key":"PxZVHh","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-xFG3Nmk/0/Th/i-xFG3Nmk-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Larch on Oak","draft":1.6,"generic_type":null,"handicap_data":{"beam":3.801},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.754,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":null,"updated_at":"2022-08-26T11:27:06.269832+00:00","website":null,"beam":null,"air_draft":null,"reference":["Classic Boat Magazine, July 2019 (pp60-64)"],"builder":"d09f64ef-8999-4792-a158-3544221a7a35","designer":"fb6b6f27-19ae-4177-a974-4d0c2a0d01c0","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Traditional"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":null,"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Home Build"},"for_sale_state":null,"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
