These are a\nvery common sight in Greece, making up a good percentage of the small boat\nfishing fleet there. However, Eleni is a real rarity in that she was built\nexplicitly as a sailing boat, unlike today's working \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, which are all\nmotorboats.</p>\n<p>She was built over the course of 7 years by amateur boat-builder Hans-Henrik\nJ\u00f8rgensen in the north of Denmark, and launched in 2001. Hans-Henrik had a\npassion for Greek boats and based his design on a sponge-fishing boat built\naround 1930 but, in consultation with Kostas Damianidis, adapted the design to\nmake it more suitable as a pure sailing boat.</p>\n<p>Eleni's working boat forbears would have had little or no accommodation to copy\nfrom, so hers is much more in the Danish tradition than Greek - and none the\nworse for that! Below, she has a pilot berth beneath a lifting chart table plus\na saloon berth to starboard, galley with Wallas stove, double seat and Blake\nhead to port, and a double v-berth forward.</p>\n<p>Between 2016 and 2018 Eleni was berthed in Maldon, where she had a new gaff\ncutter rig installed by TS Rigging, with sails by Jim Lawrence. A new Beta 50HP\nwas also installed to replace a very elderly Perkins, along with various other\nimprovements.</p>\n<p>In 2018 Eleni made her second voyage to Greece, and currently lives in Preveza\nin the Ionian, where she feels very much at home.</p>", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.801, "draft": 1.6, "length_on_deck": 9.754}, "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "cf6c14fc-7a8d-4408-97f7-f9659077eafd", "image_key": "PxZVHh", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Eleni", "oga_no": 3710, "ownerships": [{"id": 35003, "member": 6585, "share": 64}, {"id": 1, "share": 64}], "place_built": "Denmark", "reference": ["Classic Boat Magazine, July 2019 (pp60-64)"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "for_sale", "spar_material": "wood", "ssr": "SSR164905", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-xFG3Nmk/0/Th/i-xFG3Nmk-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-08-26T11:27:06.269832+00:00", "year": 2001, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3710"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
