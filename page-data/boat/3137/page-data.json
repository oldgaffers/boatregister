She was in collision with a large catarmaran whilst net fishing in July 1998 in the Solent, near Mary Rose wreck site, and sank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charter skipper of the catarmaran was prosecuted for failing to keep a proper or any lookout. QHM obtained funds by distraint from the catarmaran&#39;s insurers in order to lift &#39;Valiant&#39; from the seabed. Having been recovered, her ownership changed, and the new owner put her ashore on the Common Hard, Portsea (not far from HMS Warrior).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank Worley bought her in that condition, March 1999 and took her to Wicor Marine, Portchester whislt rebuilding her. Her portside planking was stove in amidships down to the waterline and 30 of her 50 portside frames were broken. Eight of her 18 planks were renewed along with all her frames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order&nbsp;to stiffen her, new engine bearers were installed by boatbuilders, long enough to support the fuel tank aft of the new Beta 37hp engine and PRM gearbox and the mast step forward. Two bulkheads were installed and she was partially decked. Technically, she is still an open boat, the deck has a canvas cover over the &#39;hold&#39; carlins. Two bunks were built in soft wood and ply and a third person can be accomodated overnight on foam bunk cushions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mast at 28ft&nbsp;is constructed from a telegraph pole casually cast aside in a friends garden by BT in pursuit of new EU regs. It has been slimmed down to suit.
