She was in collision with a large catarmaran whilst net\nfishing in July 1998 in the Solent, near Mary Rose wreck site, and sank.</p>\n<p>The charter skipper of the catarmaran was prosecuted for failing to keep a\nproper or any lookout. QHM obtained funds by distraint from the catarmaran's\ninsurers in order to lift <em>Valiant</em> from the seabed. Having been recovered, her\nownership changed, and the new owner put her ashore on the Common Hard, Portsea\n(not far from HMS Warrior).</p>\n<p>Frank Worley bought her in that condition, March 1999 and took her to Wicor\nMarine, Portchester whislt rebuilding her. Her portside planking was stove in\namidships down to the waterline and 30 of her 50 portside frames were broken.\nEight of her 18 planks were renewed along with all her frames.</p>\n<p>In order\u00a0to stiffen her, new engine bearers were installed by boatbuilders, long\nenough to support the fuel tank aft of the new Beta 37hp engine and PRM gearbox\nand the mast step forward. Two bulkheads were installed and she was partially\ndecked. Technically, she is still an open boat, the deck has a canvas cover over\nthe 'hold' carlins. Two bunks were built in soft wood and ply and a third person\ncan be accomodated overnight on foam bunk cushions.</p>\n<p>The mast at 28ft\u00a0is constructed from a telegraph pole casually cast aside in a\nfriends garden by BT in pursuit of new EU regs. It has been slimmed down to\nsuit. The bowsprit, 15ft, is the old mast and is hinged on the mast partners to\nreduce LoS.</p>\n<p>Sails were made from Kayospruce tan 7.2oz Clipper Canvas. \u00a0The loose footed gaff\nmain (to avoid brain damage to crew) is approx\u00a0200sq. ft with two reefs down to\napprox 100sq. ft. The forestay has either a small jib approx\u00a065sq. ft, or a cut\ndown genoa of approx 80sq. ft. A forestaysail of cream 7.2oz Clipper Canvas is\napprox 80sq. ft.</p>\n<p>Legs bolted through the hull sides to longditudinal members enable drying out\nupright and ashore over winter.</p>\n<p>Sadly <em>Valiant</em> sank on her mooring in August 2023, and was declared\nunrepairable.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.801, "draft": 1.1, "length_on_deck": 8.4}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Solent", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "967dad55-5e05-4479-8fb7-20ff8b87a90a", "image_key": "xNbt6s", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Valiant", "oga_no": 3137, "ownerships": [{"end": 1998, "name": "Freemantel Family", "share": 64, "start": 1939}, {"end": 2023, "id": 536, "member": 4882, "share": 64, "start": 1999}], "place_built": "Osborne's, Littlehampton", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Built for leisure, 'Valiant' was fished 1939-1998 by the Freemantel family out\nof Portsmouth.
