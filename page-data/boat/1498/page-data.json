This summary of her history was first published in the OGA Newsletter, 1978/3.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Lloyd&#39;s Register of 1970 lists &lsquo;Richard Davey&rsquo;, Reg. No. 164451, as Aux Gaff Ketch, owned by J.H. and C.D.Robinson; port of registry London, Home port, Yarmouth LW. Length T.M. 37.5; OA 41.5; ~ffi 34.5. Beam 10.5; Draft 6.75; Depth 7.3; SA 700. Designer&#39; and builder R.S.Burt, at Falmouth in 1913. Fitted with 4 cylinder, 56 BHP Ford oil engine&#39; in 1967.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The above extract from Lloyds gives the bare bones in describing a much loved craft owned at various stages by a handful of enthusiastic owners. Regretfully nearly all the historic data perished when she burnt out off the Scillies in Spring 1973. However, from memory, here are some details:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Richard Davey&rsquo; was presented to the Missions to Seamen by Mrs. Davey in memory of her late husband; she commissioned R.S.Burt of Falmouth to both build and design her, and details of her progress and final launch could be gathered from the Missions to Seamens News. R.S.Burt declined the services of a Lloyds Surveyor, presumably because all materials and scantlings were far in excess of Lloyds requirements.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She was framed in grown oak 4.5&rdquo; x 3&quot;, her timbers were slightly lighter at 4&quot; x 2.5&rdquo; - a mixture of sawn and grown at 18&quot; centres. She was planked with 0.5&rdquo; Pitch Pine; her floors were massive, sawn oak again, as were the horn timber, stem, and all other framing details. The keel was a huge piece of elm beautifully fashioned with all frames and timber heels notched in. The deck beams, half beams and carlings were all of oak, incredibly hard, and all the beams had lodging knees, grown and not sawn. Hatches, deck entry, skylights, etc. were all of prime teak on the same massive scale.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The Missions to Seamen News of Falmouth Area, late 1913, gave a small appreciation saying that through the generosity of Mrs. Davey they now had a &lsquo;Motor Yacht&rsquo; on station at all times; the first 6 months had resulted in a great upsurge of distribution of religious works and tracts: 349 given away, 9 purchased. Included was a picture of &lsquo;Richard Davey&rsquo; with all sails set, no wind, and I imagine, her engine, with which she was fitted from new, just ticking over.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She served on the Falmouth Station in all weathers carrying the gospel to seamen of all nationalities, and finally in 1935 she was sold out of service, then began a short but hectic period of her life when she had several owners in quick succession.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>One of these managed to get &lsquo;Richard Davey&rsquo; arrested by HM Customs on the grounds of diamond smuggling between the Thames and Holland. Lack of evidence allowed her release, but she was sold to defray costs - needless to say, all subsequent owners have searched for those little chamois leather bags, which were probably still there when she perished.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Just before the war she was bought by a Surgeon Commander, and sailed extensively; during hostilities he had her laid-up in the Medway Area, and post-war did a certain amount of work on her before selling her in 1947. Shortly after this she came into the hands of Laurie and Jo Cross (OGA members) who cruised her extensively, lived aboard, and brought up their daughter for the first few years of her life (galvanised bathtub in front of solid fuel stove - very cosy - much better than a bathroom).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In March 1962, my wife, brother and I were fortunate enough to find her for sale on the Hamble. We had a survey which considering her age was excellent - she was towed to Yarmouth, Isle of Wight which was to be her home port, and then decisions had to be taken. &lsquo;Richard Davey&rsquo; had a short solid pole main mast, a good built mizzen, a main boom with roller reefing which must have been original, such was its agricultural operation, all sails were heavy flax, cutch tanned (our admiration for Laurie Cross and his wife was unbounded), and the accommodation was a cross between the ecclesiastical, the orange box, and the practical, circa Cross.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It was decided that we should gut her completely below, and start anew. We retained the teak shelves to port and starboard, and the main prayer book shelves at either end of what was to be the saloon, good teak with something of an air about it. Work started immediately, and as with all our craft, the first item was a comprehensive galley, purpose built, which made all the rest of our labours possible. A wife who can not only cook, but paint, varnish, and is no mean woodworker is a gem beyond price.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Over the next few years we carried out all the conversion below, and then we had a stroke of pure luck which was the result of a very sad day for our Elder Gaffer, when &lsquo;Maresca&#39; stranded and was lost, but her spars, sails, rigging, etc. were salvaged. We were fortunate enough to buy them at a very reasonable price thanks to Captain J.S.Clarke.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This then was the time when we came outside so to speak. We cut out sections of the deck which were suspect - 23,&quot; thick pine, average width 4&quot; - very difficult to cut out and bend to suit. When the deck was free of all suspect patches, we covered it with 2 or 3 coats of Decolay which we found to be excellent. All exterior paint and varnish work was brought up to a good standard and then began the exciting business of stepping Maresca&rsquo;s mast; a modified bowsprit with only 10&#39; overhang; Maresca&#39;s main boom with civilised roller reefing. The mizzen mast and boom had been varnished and stepped and looked quite in keeping with our new mast. Finally our &lsquo;new&rsquo; Terylene sails were bent on, new synthetic tyoe rope was rove to all the blocks and we were in business. The last and final snag turned out to be the engine - a superb piece of marine machinery - a petrol/paraffin Parsons 40 BHP direct dfive forward and reverse. We struggled with this for 12 months and then bought a 4D Ford diesel stationary engine - ex Ready Mix Cement lorry. The marinisation was interesting and time consuming, but in some twelve months time we had a ship which was &lsquo;in all respects ready to put to sea&rsquo;.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Then began the happy years, four Old Gaffers Races, culminating in the C.H.Paxton Memorial Trophy; and many happy days of sailing on a craft tailored entirely to our requirements. She sailed very fast under plain sail, and with her long straight keel was a joy to steer. She was designed for the Atlantic swell, with regard to the shorter seas of the Channel, and she coped admirably with all conditions including the Force 10 finish to one famous Solent Race.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>First published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter, 1978/3<br />\r\nWritten by JH Robinson.</h4>","image_key":"fVkwwW","uk_part1":"164451","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Ketch","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"Pitch pine on oak grown timbers","draft":2.4384,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":3.2004389173372347,"draft":2.43842965130456,"length_over_all":12.649353816142403,"length_on_waterline":10.515727871250913},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":12.6492,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Built in 1913 for the Missions to Seamen, this much-loved yacht was burnt out off the Scillies in the spring of 1973.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:39:13.085877+00:00","website":"","beam":3.2004,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"034f4f9b-6334-45d7-a0b3-5116da588b30","designer":"3a2bf172-f648-44a1-af0f-0598af8b960b","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"R.S.
