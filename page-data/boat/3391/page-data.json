GLORY is sail number 12 (CY12) and I have owned her since 2013.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">When I found her she was ashore on her own yard cradle near Woodbridge and had obviously been out of the water for some time.&nbsp; There have been four previous owners, the original purchaser being a previous director of Barrus.&nbsp; He was able to import an example of the freshwater cooled 2 cylinder Yanmar (2GM20F) which he had Crabbers install in Glory.&nbsp; Glory Farm was the original owner’s address, which accounts for the boat’s name.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">General specifications and layout are shown below and Glory conforms pretty well to the internal layout shown.&nbsp; There is a quarter berth on the starboard side, two settee berths either side of the saloon table and an optional &ldquo;V-berth\" at waist height forward.&nbsp; A Jabsco marine toilet compartment and gas cooker are to port with a navigation station and sink to starboard.&nbsp; Realistically I find the V berth is best used for luggage and the quarter berth for athletic crew or stores.&nbsp; With standing headroom (at least in the after part of the cabin) the yawl makes a lovely home for two people for a long weekend or a week’s cruising.&nbsp; Beaching legs allow her to take the ground.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">A major part of the attraction of the yawl for me was the fact that all the controls come back into the cockpit, so even if you’re new to the gaff set up it’s very simple and safe to operate.&nbsp; The lifting keel is operated by an electric winch which can be controlled from the cockpit.&nbsp; The sail plan is also very user friendly with slab reefing of the main and roller furling headsail.&nbsp; The yawl sails nicely on mizzen and headsail alone if required.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Since acquiring Glory I’ve had the electrics pretty much renewed throughout, replaced the mast, the keel pivot bolt, the keel lifting wire, the rudder post bearing, the rudder mounting bolts, the sagging headlining, re-galvanised the lifting keel, fitted two new batteries, an ensign crane on the mizzen, serviced the automatic bilge pump, had the hull professionally copper coated, replaced all the valves and springs in the Jabsco toilet and freshwater water pump and replaced the leaky flexible water tank with a new one.&nbsp; Regular service items such as replacing anodes and engine oil etc have been done as necessary, the standing rigging was checked and passed in 2017 and running rigging has been replaced as needed.&nbsp; When the new Collars mast was installed by Nick Gates in 2018 I went with his recommendation to modify the design slightly to remove the &ldquo;through mast\" crosstree which was a permanent source of leaks into the timber, and fitted the mast band onto a ledge created in the mast itself.&nbsp; That should remove an annoying design &ldquo;feature\" whereby the cross tree movement makes a watertight seal almost impossible.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In 2017 I ordered a custom made boat cover which extends from mizzen up to the main mast to give some overwinter protection to the majority of the hull whether ashore or afloat.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In the electronics and navigation department I’ve fitted a Standard Horizon CP300 chart plotter and GX2000 DSC VHF.&nbsp; This set up will allow for future implementation of AIS on radio or plotter if required with the addition of a simple AIS engine.&nbsp; A NASA wind meter and Duet depth and speed log together with a Tiller Pilot auto steering system complete the electronics set up.&nbsp; In 2018 I installed a semi flexible 30W solar panel on the cabin roof which has kept the batteries constantly at full charge.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'\">For more pictures of the inside of the boat or to make further enquiries please contact Ebbtide Yacht Brokers.</p>","sold":null,"summary":"<p>Only 45 Cornish Yawls were built between 1988 and 1994 as successors to the Cornish Crabber Mark 1 and 2.
