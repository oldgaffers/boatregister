In mid-December 2018 the Boat Register\nEditor was asked for informaiton about a boat in St Malo which seemed to have\nbeen imported into France around 2003. Supposedly a Morecambe Bay Prawner, built\nin 1896, her new French owner was hoping to get her classified by the French\ngovernment. After tireless research, it's now confirmed that <em>Madeline</em> is not a\n'Nobby', but was built by James of Brightlingsea in 1898. Members may find the\nfull story in the March 2019 issue of Gaffers Log.</p>\n<p>The register was contacted again, in 2023, by the French owner, who sent several\npictures of her restoration and relaunch. \u00a0\"<em>Our restoration work is now\ncomplete, after all these years of hard work.</em> <em>MADELINE is back in salt water\nand we're very proud of her!</em> <em>She sails beautifully and her nautical qualities\nsurprise us with each new sail</em>.\"</p>\n<p>There are several 'For Sale' notices in the Gaffers Log newsletter and some\ninteresting race reports.</p>\n<h3>1969/2: For Sale notice</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7 Ton counter stern gaff cutter; 30 x 8.6 x 3.6; four berths; pitch pine on oak.\n1968 Stuart Turner 10 H/P. engine, with alternator and stern gear - 1,650 r.p.m.\nElectric starter.

I bought her from Mike\nBrooks (Bodger) who is an OGA member in July 1979 at Fred Webb\u2019s yard, Pin Mill.\nHe had bought her with the intention of taking her to Holland to sell and was\nnot really interested her history. He did however tell me that he bought her\nfrom a man who was moving to the USA and I think his name was Smith, I was also\ntold that she was owned by a group of young men which would tend to tie in with\nMadeleine No. 84.</p>\n<p>The measurements I gave you on the application form are correct as she has been\nvery carefully measured for the East Coast race, and I have enclosed a photo\nwhich you may keep. Her condition at present is that although her hull is in\nfair condition her deck and coachroof is in very poor condition and is at\npresent being repaired by myself, which will include new decks, cabin trunking\nand several deck beams, trying to keep everything as original as possible.</p>\n<p>I will in the next few days contact King\u2019s yard and see if they have any\ninformation and would be very much obliged if you could furnish me with the\naddresses of any of the past owners of Madeleine you may have.</p>\n<p>The only other information I have is that in 1970 her hull was rebuilt by Fred\nWebb\u2019s yard, I spoke to Fred about it and he told me in his opinion the cost of\nwhich came to more than the boat was worth and that the then owner died shortly\nafter it was completed and so never gained the benefit of the work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Extract from Race Report for the Thorn Trophy, Stour Rally, August 1987</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shoal Waters, Robinetta and Madeleine were first round Pye End, finding the\nlightest of sea breezes to give them steerage way. Madelein, setting a huge\njack-yard topsail and balloon jib, rapidly overhauled Robinetta. By Parkeston\nshe was closing the gap with Shoal Waters, but suddenly the wind went to\nwesterly, then north-westerly, catching her unawares. Thus, Shoal Waters, that\nintrepid ditch crawler, sailed to victory to take the Thorn Trophy. Madeleine\ntook the Coxswain Working Boat Trophy, whilst Robinetta took second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Extract from Maldon Anniversary Rally Report, September 1988</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite the vagaries of wind, tide and boat speed, craft closed up on each other\nas Colne Bar was turned. Noorderzon, going well in such light conditions, was\nwith Madeline and Janty. Considering Madeline had lost the top of her mast at\nthe Stone race, she was going incredibly well too, the \u2018stumpy\u2019 rig suiting her.\n. . . As nightfall came, the gaffers crossed the line, 13 out of the original 23\nhaving stuck it out for nearly 10 hours. But it had been one of those very rare\n(for 1988) days when the sun shone from sunrise to sunset, more enjoyment than\nhardship for once! Madeline took seventh place.</p>\n</blockquote>", "generic_type": "Smack Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.591, "draft": 1.067, "length_on_deck": 9.144, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "home_country": "FRA", "home_port": "St Malo", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "a0acbc10-f4e1-458c-a7a5-fd878052c601", "image_key": "GGjNjD", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Madeline", "oga_no": 84, "place_built": "Brightlingsea", "previous_names": ["Madeleine"], "reference": ["Log Mar 2019"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "84", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Built c.1896, there are some gaps in what we know about <em>Madeline</em> . . .</p>", "updated_at": "2024-10-17", "year": 1896, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/84"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
