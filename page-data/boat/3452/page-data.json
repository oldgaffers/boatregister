Being a trailer sailer, they have been able to visit a number of different sailing areas in the UK, as well as spending a summer in the Baltic. The Cape Cutter 19 was designed by Dudley Dix to be the maximum size that two hulls could be shipped within a standard 40' shipping container from its original construction site in Cape Town, South Africa. Later boats were built in Rochdale at Honnor Marine. The Cape Cutter has a bluff bow and a generous cockpit with an outboard in a well. Her lowish coachroof gives her pretty lines, and yet clever internal layout makes full use of the internal volume.
