Being a trailer sailer, they have been able to visit a number of different sailing areas in the UK, as well as spending a summer in the Baltic. The Cape Cutter 19 was designed by Dudley Dix to be the maximum size that two hulls could be shipped within a standard 40' shipping container from its original construction site in Cape Town, South Africa. Later boats were built in Rochdale at Honnor Marine. The Cape Cutter has a bluff bow and a generous cockpit with an outboard in a well. Her lowish coachroof gives her pretty lines, and yet clever internal layout makes full use of the internal volume. They carry a high-peaked mainsail, staysail and either genoa or yankee foresail.","image_key":"mBVWF4","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":null,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":10.83,"head":10.83,"luff":10.5},"length_overall":5.8003,"fore_triangle_base":3.4016,"length_on_waterline":5.5016,"fore_triangle_height":5.5992},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.8003,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Aurora is a Cape Cutter 19 built in Rochdale by Bob Brown at Honnor Marine.
