She was built in steel, riveted, and always served as a sailing cargo vessel on the big rivers and in sealand, Holland. In 1925 the first auxiliary petrol engine was mounted on the foredeck; via some shafts it was driving a propeller hanging on the side of the ship.  Later on stronger engines, that replaced the first one, were also driving the anchor winch and the loading gear. The last engine disappeared in 1979 from the foredeck after it had served in an excellent manner for 44 years. In 1952 the sailing rig was taken off and the first main engine was placed in the stern under the skippers cabin.  It was a 40 hp. Kromhout diesel; in 1965 it was replaced by the present 110 hp. Gardiner.  The present owner, the third in the life of the Klipper, bought her in 1976.  After a short while of sailing sand and shingle made ready for a voyage to Sweden to buy wood for masts and spars. Three months later the mission was brought to a good end after an adventurous voyage to Stockholm and over the Gotecanal.  In 1976 the voyage went to England to learn about steelwork. The bigger, part of the transformation from cargo vessel to sailing vessel took place that summer. In 1979 mast boom and leeboards wore made and the finishing touch was given to the steelwork. 1980: the first voyage under sail with the refitted ship took place at Eastern and during the summer \"AVONTUUR\" Was hired for a big anti-pollution voyage from Basel via Rotterdam to Esbjerg. After coming home form Esbjerg there was the first meeting with the same kind of ships.  In a regatta at Sail Amsterdam Avontuur succeeded to sail the concurrence out of sight.  In the Klipper race that same year \"Avontuur\" was less lucky and half of the competitors were faster in two Regattas’, which were sailed with very little wind.","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Schooner","construction_material":"steel","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"rivetted steel.","draft":0,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":{"length_over_all":25.908315045110946},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":25.908,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-01-31T17:02:54.973741+00:00","website":"","beam":0,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":null,"designer":null,"design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"steel"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":null,"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Schooner"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"unknown"},"builderByBuilder":null,"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
