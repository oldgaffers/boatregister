She had been stripped out many times and &nbsp;modified for power fishing. (fishing number PZ288) There were no sails, &nbsp;or indicators of mast partners left. Verbal history said she was a &nbsp;Mevagissy Tosher, but she is very big for the class. Her sharp forefoot &nbsp;has many similarities to a Mevagissy Lugger model in the science museum, &nbsp;so Edwin decided to rig her as a two masted lugger, although he thought &nbsp;she might have originally been a cutter. He also hypothesized that she &nbsp;might have been built at as a racing yacht rather than a fishing boat, &nbsp;as she is lightly built, and copper rather than iron fastenened.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>She &nbsp;was built pre-motor days as the prop shaft is set to one side as the &nbsp;stern post as an afterthought.
