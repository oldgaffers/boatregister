(fishing\nnumber PZ288) There were no sails, \u00a0or indicators of mast partners left. Verbal\nhistory said she was a \u00a0Mevagissy Tosher, but she is very big for the class. Her\nsharp forefoot \u00a0has many similarities to a Mevagissy Lugger model in the science\nmuseum, \u00a0so Edwin decided to rig her as a two masted lugger, although he thought\n\u00a0she might have originally been a cutter. He also hypothesized that she \u00a0might\nhave been built at as a racing yacht rather than a fishing boat, \u00a0as she is\nlightly built, and copper rather than iron fastenened.</p>\n<p>She \u00a0was built pre-motor days as the prop shaft is set to one side as the \u00a0stern\npost as an afterthought. Her dates are not known, but she may have built around\n1880.</p>\n<p>Arround 2012 she had deteriorated once again, leading to a total rebuild between\n2015 and 2022 including replacing aft section of keel, sternpost, transom, all\nribs, new floors, beam shelf, approx. 70% of planking, deck and bulwarks.
