But there was a war on.\nConstant survived it, Albert Strange died naturally in 1917, and No. 144 - his\nlargest canoe yawl design - remained unbuilt.   </p>\n<p>Enter Howth, County Dublin dental surgeon A.W. 'Billy' Mooney, a very active\nmember of Howth Yacht Club and avid sailor, until recently owner of the Howth 17\nClass day racing cutter <em>Rita</em>, and desirous of extending the sailing horizons\nafforded by his converted RNLI lifeboat cruising ketch LIL.      Perhaps also in\ncelebration, or at least a refection of stability in Ireland following its\nturbulent early 20th Century years of the First World War, the War of\nIndependence, and the Civil War, Mooney purchased the No. 144 drawings from\nStrange's widow, Julia, and Jack Tyrrell gave them form that winter at his\nfamily's industrious boatyard on the bank of the River Avoca, Arklow, County\nWicklow.\u00a0      Tyrrell was only turning 20, and <em>Nirvana</em> (as she would be\nlaunched) may have been the first Tyrrell yard build in his command, yet he was\nalready highly experienced in the building and operation of the sailing coasters\nhis family owned. 35-year-old Mooney was also experienced as a racer and cruiser\nof small yachts. He is believed to have been deeply involved in the\nspecification and build.      Mooney cruised <em>Nirvana</em> extensively and\nsuccessfully on the Irish and Scottish coasts between Valentia and Stornoway.\nHis house names over the years reflect a particular love of sailing on the west\ncoast of Scotland - 'Craigmore' (Isle of Bute); 'Colintraive' (Kyles of Bute);\n'Ardfern' (Argyll) - but he was no stranger to home waters, especially the\nmagical, Atlantic fringe West Cork anchorages reached so comfortably with\n<em>Nirvana</em>. He became one of the founding members of the Irish Cruising Club\nduring their first 1929 meet at Glengarriff. An ambitious and sometimes stormy\n1932 family cruise to Cornwall and Devon won the Mooneys and <em>Nirvana</em> the\nclub's already prestigious Falkner Cup - judged by none other than Yachting\nMonthly editor Maurice Griffiths.\u00a0      To those who can't imagine sailing\nadventure without electronic guidance here's a wonderful description of a closer\nthan wished for encounter with foggy Tuskar Rock from <em>Nirvana</em>'s 1932 log:\n\u201cWe could hear the five minute fog [signal] explosion on the Tuskar and wishing\nto see the rock if possible, as it is quite steep to on its northern side,\nsteered straight for it. Unfortunately the navigation was too good, for in one\nof the intervals between the explosions the rock loomed up suddenly, apparently\nalmost overhead and before my crew, who was steering could realise it, there was\na jolt and there we were piled up. At that moment the gun went off directly\noverhead. I rushed up on deck, saw deep water on both sides of us and realised\nwe had crossed the boat slip to the rock, and in a moment had the headsails down\nand soon <em>Nirvana</em> glided off into deep water.\u201d      Mooney wrote that <em>Nirvana</em>\nhad been \u201csuch a success and so easy to handle by myself that I am seriously\nconsidering something larger of at least 16 tons, still single-hander.\u201d In the\nevent, a serious illness in 1933 forced the sale of <em>Nirvana</em>, but afforded time\nto conceive her successor, the remarkable Mooney/ John Kearney/ Fred Shepherd/\nJack Tyrrell ketch AIDEEN.      In 1934, 30-year-old Irish American Ethel\nCrimmins of East Ferry, Cork Harbour, became <em>Nirvana</em>'s 2nd owner in tragic but\npassionate circumstances. In the fashion of the time known as Mrs Ralph G.\nCrimmins, her American husband had perished in a small boat accident the\nprevious year. Determined to continue the sailing adventures the couple had\nenjoyed, Ethel bought <em>Nirvana</em>, hired a paid hand and set sail with some gusto\n- winning <em>Nirvana</em>'s 2nd I.C.C. Falkner Cup in their first season together for\na round Ireland cruise taking in Scottish waters.      By 1937 Ethel had\nemigrated to Baltimore, Maryland, and by the late 1930s <em>Nirvana</em>'s home port\nhad moved to Holyhead, Wales, for a pre and post Second World war period of\nownership by north of England resident summer members of Trearddur Bay Sailing\nClub: pre-war by J.W. Williams of Altrincham, Cheshire; post-war by Rotherham,\nYorkshire based Robert Garth Gwynne, Dr Philip Edgar Pym, and H. Smith. It may\njust be coincidence, but all three of <em>Nirvana</em>'s early ownerships revolved\naround the dental and medical worlds.      Although ownership briefly\ntransferred 1950-51 to James and Simmone Styles of Hull, later Poole - members\nof Humber Yawl Club, Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club and later Parkstone Yacht Club -\nthere is no evidence to suggest <em>Nirvana</em>'s mooring changed from Holyhead. By\n1951 a long and stable period of ownership by Belfast Lough/ Strangford Lough\nyachtsmen began, and more cruising in Irish and Scottish waters. During this\nperiod a practical for inclement weather, though rather ugly doghouse was\nfitted. Albert Strange would not have approved.      1951-1963   Arthur Douglas\nMacIlwaine - Belfast stockbroker, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Officer, member\nof Royal North of Ireland, Royal Ulster and Strangford Lough Yacht Clubs - who\nchanged her name to <em>Nirvana</em> OF ARKLOW.      1963-1965   John T. McVicker,\nBelfast, a RNIYC, RUYC member      1965-1976   Andrew Sheamus Henderson of\nNewton Abbey, later Killinchy, a member of Carrickfergus Sailing Club and\nStrangford Lough Yacht Club who probably moored <em>Nirvana</em> at Whiterock,\nStrangford Lough.      1976-1989   Joseph Patrick Hammill of Whiterock,\nKillinchy, Strangford Lough.      1989-   Peter and Nancy Clay, Woodbridge,\nSuffolk. Peter - brought up sailing the counter-sterned 34 ft 6 in Albert\nStrange yawl FIREFLY, owned by his family since 1934 - found <em>Nirvana</em> OF ARKLOW\nnot in Northern Ireland, but in a very appropriate place for such a characterful\nyacht: the wonderfully traditional McKellar's Slipway, Kilcreggan, on the Firth\nof Clyde, the last Clyde patent slipway yard run by brothers Ronnie and Ian\nMacGrouther and not far from two of Billy Mooney's house names, 'Ardbeg' and\n'Colintraive'. <em>Nirvana</em>'s wonderful story with the Clays began on a soggy early\nsummer 1990 voyage from the Clyde to Harwich - perhaps this beautiful and very\ncapable canoe-yawl's longest to that point.\u00a0   \u00a92023 Iain McAllister/ Sandeman\nYacht Company Ltd.
