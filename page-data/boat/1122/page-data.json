In the 1990s she was based on the Thames when she needed work to be done including new stern planking and a new deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There had been a report that she had been spotted in Weymouth in the early 2000s. This was confirmed by OGA member Jon Hardwick who reported in 2018 he had spotted&nbsp;a rather lovely old cutter in Weymouth Marina called &#39;White Heather&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;Over the last few years she seemed to be gradually declining and had developed a significant list to starboard. She disappeared, only to turn up in the boatyard at Portland Marina and obviously having some work done on the hull, I assumed that all was OK and the owner was slowly getting her sorted out. She disappeared again and I thought no more about it until I read the article in OGA Newsletter, Gaffers Log, December 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I visited the yard and found &#39;White Heather&#39; tucked away in a corner out of plain sight. She is in very poor condition and at this time seems to have been abandoned. The marina have assumed ownership and are looking for someone to save her from the chain saw!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wondered if this was the &#39;White Heather&#39; reported as mysteriously disappearing from the Thames. I asked to go aboard and have a look at the condition and in so doing&nbsp;I found a faintly carved ships registration number in the forward deck beam: 131802. Searching on Google, this came up with an article on the Harrison Butler website. A picture of the boat showed a cutter with a transom, but a very similar look to the rig I have seen. The Portland &#39;White Heather&#39; has a counter stern. which I now think is an alteration. and may have resulted in her not being recognised. She has no name painted anywhere on her hull either at this time adding to the mystery.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer&nbsp;2018 Pat Dawson, OGA Boat Register Editor, was given a Log Book of &#39;White Heather&#39;&nbsp;who had resided in Yarmouth for many years under the ownership of James H.N&nbsp;Malcolm. He cruised her around the Solent and across to Cherbourg and the Channel Islands in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latter part of the Log Book refers to cruises in another boat called &#39;Feathers&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James H.N Malcolm sold &#39;White Heather&#39; to Peter Jenner 15 March 1974. She was sold again to&nbsp;Michael Formosa who planned to sail her singlehanded to Malta. Unfortunately she went aground on the Shingles off the Needles on Sunday 23&nbsp;December and was rescued by the Yarmouth Lifeboat and returned to Yarmouth. It seems Michael Formosa was not deterred and advertised for two girls to join him to sail to Malta. He says, &quot;Girls are much more pleasant and not always fighting and you do not have the problem in their getting drunk in every port.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pat Dawson remembers the boat in Yarmouth Harbour in the 1970s. The story went that she had had a counter added at some stage. &#39;Iseult&#39;, was also moored in Yarmouth then. Built by the same yard, she had had a counter added in 1927.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;White Heather&#39; had a British Registry, but not in her early days. Had she been registered at the start she would have been registered in Poole, but her registry is London. She does not appear in the 1921 Register of Ships but is in the 1939 Register and listed as owned by a William N. Leach. In 1957 she was owned by Eric Long. She appears in the 1966 and 1973 Lloyds Registers as being owned by James H.N&nbsp;Malcolm. In all these Registries her length is 35.7ft on deck, so her counter had ben added before she was registered, if she ever was transom sterned to start with.</p>","image_key":"w7z4WW","uk_part1":"131802","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":1.9202,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":{"beam":3.3528407705437697,"draft":1.9202633504023408,"length_over_all":10.881492318946599,"length_on_waterline":9.326993416239942},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.8814,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;White Heather&#39; was built as a yacht in Poole, 1908.
