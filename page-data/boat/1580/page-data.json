Following his return, and whilst in command of the torpedo boat destroyer &lsquo;Porcupine&rsquo; in 1906, he purchased &lsquo;Lona II&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OGA member Richard Meynell, who owned &#39;Lona II&#39; until 2005, received these two extracts from the Lieutenant&#39;s 1906 log from his grand-daughter, Susan Bell, nee Barne:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>Felixstowe Dock to Woodbridge in July 1906</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In the morning I sailed from Felixstowe Dock, where I had anchored for the night, and arrived off the entrance to Bawdsey Haven, into which I had never before been, at about midday.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Scorning the assistance of a pilot, I thought to sail in without misadventure, by following what I took to be the channel, from the absence of breaking seas, the breeze being moderate, and blowing right in. Alas, my pride met its speedy reward, and I grounded and commenced working about in the shingle on the bar, but not bumping very badly, for which last mercy I was thankful.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The tide was flowing, so I laid the anchor out in what I discovered to be the proper channel, a few fathoms to the Northward of the place I had chosen. This proceeding was not unaccompanied by incident. Upon first grounding, I had made the dinghy fast under the bowsprit, as the yacht&rsquo;s stern had been to seaward, which had caused the dinghy to swing alongside and bump with the swell.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When I got on the bowsprit to get into the dinghy, I first cast off the painter and threw it into the boat, intending to follow it immediately. This last portion of my plan was frustrated, through the seat of my trousers having become firmly caught on the hook of the jib outhaul. Upon attempting, therefore, to leap into the dinghy, I found myself suspended in space and above the limpid waves by the seat of my nether garments. The dinghy meanwhile began to drift rapidly in over the bar, toward the haven being impelled by wind and tide. There was but one thing to do, and I did it, this was to struggle for my knife which was in my trousers pocket and cut away that portion of those garments by which I was attached to the bowsprit. I lost little time in cutting it away and when I had dropped into the sea I soon regained the truant dinghy. After some time, during which the yacht seemed to be set by the tide higher and higher up the knoll, she eventually swung to her anchor and I managed to sail in over the bar. I sailed successfully up to Woodbridge that evening carrying the jackyard topsail and the flood tide all the way, and on arrival there, having stowed up I landed and walked to Melton where I had supper with Lieutenant G Crispin and his sister.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>My misadventures were a topic of jovial discussion over our glass of port that evening!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>Saturday 20 August 1906</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Having completed the purchase of &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; at Burnham on the 10th August, from Mr J Pain Clark, for the sum of &pound;250, I travelled from Portsmouth where I was in command of the torpedo boat destroyer &lsquo;Porcupine&rsquo; on the Friday night, finding &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; alongside King&rsquo;s stage at Burnham stored and ready for sea. As she would not be afloat until about 3am, I turned in, and was awakened at that hour by King&rsquo;s son-in-law. He came on board and assisted me to lay her off, and pick up a mooring, which we did under the roller foresail (the working sail), and he returned ashore until 5 o&rsquo;clock while I took the mainsail coat off, and got ready for sea.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There was a light SW breeze blowing and was all right for the Orwell, whither I was bound. At 5 o&rsquo;clock he came off and helped me to get under way. I shipped at a quarter past five, under plain sail, and sailed down the River Crouch in transports of delight and pride of my purchase, the first vessel having a deck that I had ever possessed.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Lona&rsquo; was only built for the previous season, 1905, and was the very latest and smartest thing in five ton cruisers, built by Messrs W. King and was to Mr Pain Clark&rsquo;s own design. She was built to stand heavy weather, having easy lines, moderate overhang with a spoon bow and a flush deck, with small cockpit giving access to the cabin. Her topsides were of teak, bottom of elm and pitch pine, timbers of English oak and deck of Kauri pine.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She had a fir pole-mast with roller reefing mainsail and roller foresail. The deck fittings, cockpit etc were of teak and all finished in the best possible manner. She was metal fastened throughout, with a lead keel and no inside ballast. In her coat of glossy black enamel with white boot top and gilt ribbon, with well cleaned spars, she was the most beautiful little picture of a yacht that could be imagined, and I was indeed proud of her.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I gave myself and the deck a wash down as I went and, when in the neighbourhood of the NW Buxey buoy, I shifted the jib head topsail for the jackyard and topsail and squared away again for Harwich. The breeze freshened when I was off the Naze but, as it was fair, I hung on to the jackyarder and got into Harwich harbour at about four.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When in the Orwell, I hove to and took in the topsail and pursued my way up the river against the ebb tide, hoping to get to Ipswich, where I intended to leave her until I could get some leave.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The wind fell very light and I was just making a little way over the tide when, not being acquainted with the buoyage of the river and foolishly not allowing sufficient room, I ran on the middle ground, which, as those who know the Orwell will testify, is right off the outfall of the Ipswich sewer.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I was soon aware of this fact, the aroma from the mud flats, as the tide fell, being almost overpowering. I had myself to thank entirely for the misadventure and resolved to pay more regard to the buoyage. I discovered, at low water, that the tide recedes below the buoys by several feet, leaving them high and dry. (In spite of these resolutions, however, I managed to get aground in the Orwell upon countless occasions, both in subsequent cruises in &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; and &lsquo;Winifred&rsquo;).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>As the tide left her she took a heavy list to starboard and while laying out the anchor in the dinghy, I had opportunity to admire her delightfully and charmingly symmetrical proportions, both above and below the water line. During the night the wind arose and by morning it was blowing &lsquo;great guns&rsquo;.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In the small hours, before the &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; was afloat, I thought it would be a good idea to make myself a strong brew of tea. Acting upon this decision I groped in the pantry locker, (the only light being provided by the &lsquo;Beatrice&rsquo; cooking stove) and finding a tin of the size and shape of that in which I know the tea to be stowed, I poured a good quantity of its contents into the kettle when it was boiling. When it was cool enough to drink, I took a long and lusty pull at it, having added to it some condensed milk and sugar, and then longed heartily for the surrounding mud to rise and choke me and put me out of my misery &ndash; the &lsquo;tea&rsquo; that I had poured into the kettle was no less than a quantity of Sam Clark&rsquo;s rather dry, strong, tobacco!!!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When I recovered, I thought it time to be getting under way, the &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; being afloat. The wind was South West and any amount of it. I went up under the foresail and let go the anchor below the Bight, just above the Bathing and Rowing Club, which was on the weather shore. She quickly dragged her anchor across the river and took the ground off the . . .</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And there unfortunately Michael Barne&rsquo;s narrative comes to an end.</blockquote>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.2342, "draft": 1.7008, "fore_triangle_base": 4.87685930260912, "fore_triangle_height": 7.467690807120214, "length_on_deck": 9.7536, "length_on_waterline": 7.467690807120214, "length_over_all": 9.75371860521824, "main": {"foot": 6.0960741282613995, "head": 4.26725188978298, "luff": 4.57205559619605}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 1.005415518, "topsail": {"luff": 5.4864667154352595, "perpendicular": 2.286027798098025}}, "home_country": "ITA", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "2b18108d-d0f1-4efe-91c1-94304bfea6fc", "image_key": "JDZbTh", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Lona II", "oga_no": 1580, "ownerships": [{"end": 2004, "name": "Richard Meynell", "share": 64, "start": 1992}], "place_built": "Burnham on Crouch", "reference": ["Log June 2007", "Log March 2008"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "5", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>&#39;Lona II&#39; is a miniature racing yacht of the period.
