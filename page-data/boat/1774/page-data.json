In the 1920s she was owned by Charles Nicholson and in the 1930s by John Nicholson when she was sailed energetically in the Solent. By this stage she had been converted to a Bermudan cutter. She was re-rigged for racing after the Second World War. Originally she was flush-decked, with the companion way and skylight and recorded as having little headroom. Even with the coachroof, there is not much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, she was purchased by Nicholas Hall. She was lying at Hayling Yacht Co. on a drying pontoon, where she had been for many years. The Yanmar 2 QM engine has been removed for overhaul and the port side has been re-caulked. The starboard side, coachroof and deck also need some attention.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.8956, "draft": 1.8288, "length_on_deck": 9.144, "length_on_waterline": 8.22970007315289, "length_over_all": 9.1441111923921}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Langstone Harbour", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "fabb3859-602c-4fab-b821-4bf101e528da", "image_key": "LVhM2z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Tammie", "nsbr": "2370", "oga_no": 1774, "ownerships": [{"end": 30, "note": "Bought by current owner, Nicholas Hall, from Richard Hobbin on 30 Nov 2012.
