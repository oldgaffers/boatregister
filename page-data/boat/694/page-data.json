They had a curious habit of pushing matchsticks and plasticine into the top of the garboard seam from the inside! In those days she was painted dark green and had a pushpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At&nbsp;University, Arabella,&nbsp;one of her current owners saw a photograph of Nepenthe and immediately asked about her. &nbsp;Robert Fisher had apparently bought her as an insurance write off after she had been sat upon by another boat in the 1987 storm, she was by then on the South East coast. &nbsp;Full details are not known but it is assumed that her coach roof sides and cockpit were then replaced, as was&nbsp;the&nbsp;interior. &nbsp;Much of the work was probably&nbsp;done by Robert Fisher himself who showed some skill as a carpenter&nbsp;- the chart table is particularly lovely.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hull appears to have been largely unaffected although there are some sister ribs that may have been added&nbsp;following the storm damage. Robert sailed her extenisvely with&nbsp;his wife and son James.&nbsp;She was based on the East Coast around Brightlingsea and Woodbridge&nbsp;and made voyages to France,&nbsp;the Baltic and through the Dutch canals. &nbsp;Arabella was invited aboard for two summer East Coast cruises. &nbsp;She&nbsp;later lost contact with the family but&nbsp;fondly remembered&nbsp;the beautiful Nepenthe. &nbsp;No leaks by the way, this problem must have&nbsp;been cured somewhere along the line, perhaps when being re-fitted after the storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, she was spotted for sale and Arabella and her husband Roderick bought her&nbsp;at entirely the wrong time.....the same year as their first child was born! &nbsp;She was transported to Falmouth and has remained in the Roseland Peninsula ever since, currently moored in St Mawes. &nbsp;Young children and a natural cautiousness&nbsp;have dictated some conservative inshore sailing in the area. &nbsp;She&nbsp;has been kept in good shape along the way and is as fast as you would expect off the wind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name Nepenthe derives from a Greek weed or herb said to grant oblivion from all ills. &nbsp;Whilst headaches have been indeed been&nbsp;caused by owning Nepenthe (or shall we just call them hangovers?)&nbsp;it is true to say that when you step aboard somehow all ones cares appear to be washed away. &nbsp;</p>","image_key":null,"uk_part1":"164198","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel pine on oak with iron keel","draft":1.2192,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"main":{"foot":6.157034869544013,"head":5.6388685686417945},"thcf":0.961,"draft":1.21921482565228,"sailarea":47.002532962651586,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":9.1441111923921,"fore_triangle_base":5.9436722750548645,"length_on_waterline":8.991709339185563,"fore_triangle_height":11.734942696903193},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.144,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Designed and built by Harry Feltham, Portsmouth, 1930 as a Bermudan cutter, &#39;Nepenthe&#39; was re-rigged as a gaff cutter in the 1960s.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:38:49.781912+00:00","website":"","beam":2.8956,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"4fb74132-3ca7-4f28-8b2d-52d96db774f7","designer":"f8c85f47-b20c-4687-baea-172a05d5d1f1","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Harry Feltham"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Harry Feltham"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
