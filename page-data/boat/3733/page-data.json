After passing into private ownership she was sailed on the Norfolk\nBroads regularly until 1997. During this time various alterations were made to\nher length and keel to improve her sailing qualities.</p>\n<p>In 1997 <em>Falcon II</em> was taken to the International Boat Building College in\nLowestoft where she would remain for around 15 years. By 2012 her then owner had\ncompleted a major refit and restoration. Little is known of what happend over\nthe next 7 years but by 2019 and suffering from neglect, major work was needed\nonce again.</p>\n<p>A change of ownership (only her 4th owner since leaving the hire fleet of John\nLoynes) and initial refurbishment works were completed by the summer of 2021\nwhich included a new keel, planking and a new engine. Built with oak frames and\niroko planking, she is unusal for a Broads Yacht due to her teak decks. The\ncabin side and cockpit are mahogony and the mast, boom, gaff and bow sprit are\nDouglas fir. With her restoration more or less complete,\u00a0<em>Falcon II</em> is\nprofessionally maintained at a boatyard in Wroxham and is now regularly sailed\non the Broads once more.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.56, "draft": 1.006, "length_on_deck": 10.607, "length_on_waterline": 9.083}, "home_country": "United Kingdom", "home_port": "Norfolk Broads", "hull_form": "fin keel", "image_key": "xt7Rgn", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Falcon II", "oga_no": 3733, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "name": "Guy Wilkes", "share": 64, "start": "2019"}], "place_built": "Wroxham", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "84", "short_description": "<p>Built originally as a class of 2 by John Loynes and Sons Originally built for\ntheir hire fleet on the Norfolk Broads.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2025-01-07", "year": 1936, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3733"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
