Laura\nis a little deeper draftedthan a trawler of the same length but the fishing\ngrounds worked out of Fleetwood and Douglas would allow for this. \u00a0Laura\nappeared as a subject of a book, written by Edward Delmar- Morgan in the early\n1950's. He probably bought her in 1950 or 1951 as the book describes her refit\nand first cruise she made to France before the book was published in 1954. She\nwas Bermudan rigged then with a substantial coach roof and fitted with a wing\nengine. Laura was in a rundown state when Delmar-Morgan found her, so he motored\nher round to Portsmouth Harbour for a thorough refit. Most of the work seems to\nhave been cosmetic. An accident occurred that showed she was still using her\noriginal beaching legs that fastened to a large eyebolt through the beam shelf\nand deck. One of these pulled through the deck causing a fair amount of real\nwork on top of addressing the effects of the neglect. \u00a0Laura knocked around the\nsouth coast during the next 30 years, to be found, still with her Bermudan\nRig.Laura was bought by Bill Sissons in 1980. She sailed in the seasons of 1980\nand 1981 and was then laid up in a mud berth. Gayle Heard the sail maker helped\nbring her round to the Blackwater. He was looking for a fast boat and was so\nimpressed he bought her in 1985. he then undertook a 6 year total re-build, all\nframes were replaced with steamed timbers. By replacing the cast iron keelson\nand concrete ballast with lead, her headroom was improved. She was returned to\ngaff rig with hollow spars and a new suit of sails. The rebuild was not complete\nas she has 90% of her planking, her keel and sternpost. Port and starboard top\nstrakes were replaced and stringers were inserted to stiffen her up. The deck\nand above is all new. The rebuild was finished in 1991 and she raced very\nsuccessfully for the next 10 years. \u00a0Bought &amp; returned to Fleetwood 2001 and\nraced very successfully in Nobby Owners and Conwy River Festival. Laid up 2007\nto 2018 then sold and repairs carried out at Waterfront Marine by Scott\nMetcalfe. Currently berthed in Porth Penrhyn.
