We found her minus deck and coachroof in a barn and rebuilt this with two layers 12mm marine ply topped with 20mm teak. Due to a mistake by a boatyard we employed to carry out some work, they reconnected the cockpit drains the wrong way around and the boat siphoned water when sailed hard and filled to bunk level before we noticed so ruined the air cooled Ducati engine and the electrics. Further damage was done by the RNLI ripping up the floorboards without waiting for the water to be pumped out above. This resulted in two areas of woodwork damage and the cabin doors. This is a relatively inexpensive fix but the engine will need replacing.</p><p>We do not have the time to do this at a distance, so reluctantly she\"s up for sale. Up on the hard at Ridge on the West side of Poole harbour, fees are paid until April 2017.</p><p>4 and 3/4 berth, heads between main cabin and forepeak V-berth. 2 mains, several foresails. Plus we have a topsail (not currently rigged) and a mizzen never fitted.
