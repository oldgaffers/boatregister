'The boats soon proved their worth, although they quickley attracted the attention not only of young people but also of crack helmsmen, which, while disheartening to the new hands, set a high standard of sailing which the younger school were able to emulate.\u00a0 Proof of their growing popularity was the commission of six or seven new Norfolks each year unitl the commencement of war, and they continued to be made at this rate from 1947 until 1951, with ten new ones in 1949.  In fact, numbers of new boats wer lessening, for from 1951 until 1968 only nine more were built.\u00a0 The last was number 86 in 1968.\u00a0 Tes Chamberlin picked out three young helsmen who were already proving their ability in 1951, in spite of their youth.\u00a0 The three young helmsmen were Ian Mackintosh, Martin Broom and Raymond Jeckells, all of who are still sailing the identical boats they did all those years ago.\u00a0 Ted Chamberlin commented \"It is a great credit to the builders of these boats that Ian Mackintosh is getting winning guns in a boat that was built several years before he was born, which just goes to prove what a high standard of craftsmanship there is in the Norfolk boatyards.\"  One change, however, has been forced upon the class since the war, and this was the replacement of bamboo with hollowed spruce for spars and masts, due to the impossibility of obtaining suitable bamboo.\u00a0 But there is still a few bamboo masts to be seen, as well as plenty of gaffs and booms.\u00a0 The boats were built of African mahogany, clench built, copper fastened, with gunter rig, no spinnaker being allowed, and even no forestay or battens.  The \"B\" on the sail rather than \"N\" for Norfolks is confusing until one remembers that the 12 foot Nationals, which were sailed frequently on these waters inter-war, display the letter \"N\".\u00a0 Therefore \"B\" for Broads was chosen.</p>", "generic_type": "Dinghy", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.6398, "length_on_deck": 4.2672, "length_on_waterline": 4.26725188978298, "length_over_all": 4.26725188978298}, "home_port": "Wroxham", "id": "517c426b-6e14-4cf8-b567-170682eac595", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Widgeon", "oga_no": 2867, "ownerships": [{"name": "Nicholas Hacox", "share": 64, "start": 2008}], "place_built": "Potter Heigham", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "B55", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1947, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2867"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
