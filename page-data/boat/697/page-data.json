So we watched from the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Lufra's main has been cut down slightly and a longer bowsprit fitted to give her a cutter rig, reducing the heavy weather helm of the original. Also a topsail is carried in winds of force 3-4 or less and acts as the first reef. After the Clyde race we had to leave the boat at Inverkip for a week, a friend and I sailed her home to Girvan the following Sunday with a quartering breeze and all plain sail plus topsail and drabbler. We left Kip Marian at 17:30 and entered Girvan Pierheads at 15:30. Not bad for a Cherub.\"\r\n\r\nLufra moved south after this race, and was subsequently kept in Cornwall and the Isles of  Scilly.
