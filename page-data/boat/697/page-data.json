So we watched from the shore.</p>\n<p>\"Lufra's main has been cut down slightly and a longer bowsprit fitted to give her a cutter rig, reducing the heavy weather helm of the original. Also a topsail is carried in winds of force 3-4 or less and acts as the first reef. After the Clyde race we had to leave the boat at Inverkip for a week, a friend and I sailed her home to Girvan the following Sunday with a quartering breeze and all plain sail plus topsail and drabbler. We left Kip Marian at 17:30 and entered Girvan Pierheads at 15:30. Not bad for a Cherub.\"</p>\n<p>Lufra moved south after this race, and was subsequently kept in Cornwall and the Isles of  Scilly. In 1987 her rig was recorded as being altered from a \"high peak gaff sloop to a conventional gaff cutter, with the mast altered to fit in a tabernacle.\"</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.1336, "draft": 0.8382, "length_on_deck": 6.4008, "length_on_waterline": 5.18166300902219, "length_over_all": 6.4008778346744695}, "home_port": "Scillies", "hull_form": "unknown", "id": "181898c5-5646-41fe-b016-f6c593a00b59", "image_key": "gwKVRf", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Lufra", "oga_no": 697, "ownerships": [{"note": "pre 1987 Mr Aitkin", "start": 1987, "text": "pre"}, {"end": 1989, "note": "1987-1989 Aidan de la Mare", "start": 1987, "text": "Aidan de la Mare"}, {"end": 1997, "note": "1989-1997 Norma Ashun", "start": 1989, "text": "Norma Ashun"}, {"end": 2016, "name": "Dominic Walsh-Newton", "share": 64, "start": 2001}, {"note": "2001-?
