Other Jewel Class yachts were Sapphire, Ruby, Emerald, Iolite and Pearl. Diamond, Sapphire and Emerald are recorded in Llloyds Register.</p>\n<p>Blackpool and Fleetwood Yacht Club first looked at one design boat in 1908 One design classes were becoming popular on Merseyside with the designs such as Southport Star Class and Hoylake Opera Class. They asked three boat builders to quote for a 23 foot yacht costing around \u00a340. Armours of Fleetwood returned a quote of \u00a376, Crossfield Brothers of Church Hill, Arnside \u00a359 and William Crossfield and Sons of Beach Walk, Arnside \u00a355. As all quotes were more than anticipated they decide to look at a 20ft version (Committee minutes post 1909 do not exist so the outcome is not known). Llloyds Register records Sapphire as being 20 foot long whilst Diamond and Emerald are listed as being 23 foot long, all built in 1912.</p>\n<p>The Royal Mersey Rivers Class, which includes Arnside Sailing Club's Severn and Deva owned by Jon Wainwright, a leading OGA member for nearly 50 years is based on the Jewel Class. The Royal Mersey decided they wanted a new boat quickly and therefore based their design on the Jewel Class. The Rivers Class cost \u00a350 excluding sails with the first six boats delivered in 1912.</p>\n<p>Though Blackpool and Fleetwood Yacht Club were headquartered at Blackpool, boats were kept and raced at the Fleetwood on the Wyre Estuary. The Yacht Club is now based at Skippool further down the Estuary near Poulton-le-Fylde. Fortnightly races were organised with an annual regatta. Wardleys Creek Regatta on the other side of the Wyre Estuary also offered races for the Jewel Class, as will as village sports such as wrestling.</p>\n<p>Lloyds Register records Diamond as being owned in 1928 by A.H.Mansergh who lived in the sea front at Bare in Morecambe. Prior to the war A.H.Mansergh lived at Sunderland Point at the mouth of the River Lune south of Lancaster a village cut off at high tide. In 1912 he was vice captain of the Blackpool and Fleetwood Yacht Club and it is probable that he was Diamond\u2019s first owner. He was also a member of the Royal Mersey and Isle of Man Yacht Clubs and a Port of Lancaster Commisioner. The easiest way to get from Sunderland Point to Fleetwood in 1912 would have been by sea, suggesting that Diamond may have been kept at Sunderland Point and sailed to Fleetwood for races.</p>\n<p>He was a linoleum merchant based in Lancaster. Lancaster was a leading centre for the manufacture of linoleum. He also owned Sue a 38 foot yacht which was built at Overton in 1919, which is the next village to Sunderland Point. He sailed Sue regularly to the Scottish Isles and took part in the Fleetwood \u2013 Isle of Man race, competing against &nbsp;Crossfields' boats including Moya. He employed a master to sail his yachts, but usually helmed himself. He died in 1937 at the age of 70. His obituary says he was one of the most popular yachtsman in the country.</p>\n<p>From 1930 she is recorded as being owned by Dr F.W.Bury, the senior partner in the Queens Square practise, Lancaster who kept her until at the least the Second World War. She is not recorded in Lloyds Register in 1947 or 1948. Dr F.W.Bury had previously worked in the Lancaster Royal Infirmary and been the Chief Medical Officer for the Smalley district of Derbyshire. He was President of Lancaster Royal Infirmary Committee in 1938.</p>\n<p>It would be interesting know what happen to her after 1945.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.0818, "draft": 0.9144, "fore_triangle_base": 4.57205559619605, "fore_triangle_height": 5.7912704218483295, "length_on_deck": 7.0104, "length_on_waterline": 5.7912704218483295, "length_over_all": 7.010485247500609, "main": {"foot": 4.26725188978298, "head": 3.2004389173372347, "luff": 3.2004389173372347}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.887063898, "topsail": {"luff": 3.3528407705437697, "perpendicular": 1.8288222384784198}}, "home_port": "Fleetwood", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "30257a1a-549c-4271-8e7c-88332a495a58", "image_key": "FL7jMQ", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Diamond", "oga_no": 2012, "ownerships": [{"name": "M Royle", "share": 64, "start": 1988}], "place_built": "Arnside", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Diamond was a Blackpool and Fleetwood Yacht Club Jewel Class Boat built by Crossfields in Arnside in 1912.
