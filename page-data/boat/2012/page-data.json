Other Jewel Class yachts were Sapphire, Ruby, Emerald, Iolite and Pearl. Diamond, Sapphire and Emerald are recorded in Llloyds Register.</p>\n<p>Blackpool and Fleetwood Yacht Club first looked at one design boat in 1908 One design classes were becoming popular on Merseyside with the designs such as Southport Star Class and Hoylake Opera Class. They asked three boat builders to quote for a 23 foot yacht costing around £40. Armours of Fleetwood returned a quote of £76, Crossfield Brothers of Church Hill, Arnside £59 and William Crossfield and Sons of Beach Walk, Arnside £55. As all quotes were more than anticipated they decide to look at a 20ft version (Committee minutes post 1909 do not exist so the outcome is not known). Llloyds Register records Sapphire as being 20 foot long whilst Diamond and Emerald are listed as being 23 foot long, all built in 1912.</p>\n<p>The Royal Mersey Rivers Class, which includes Arnside Sailing Club's Severn and Deva owned by Jon Wainwright, a leading OGA member for nearly 50 years is based on the Jewel Class. The Royal Mersey decided they wanted a new boat quickly and therefore based their design on the Jewel Class. The Rivers Class cost £50 excluding sails with the first six boats delivered in 1912.</p>\n<p>Though Blackpool and Fleetwood Yacht Club were headquartered at Blackpool, boats were kept and raced at the Fleetwood on the Wyre Estuary. The Yacht Club is now based at Skippool further down the Estuary near Poulton-le-Fylde. Fortnightly races were organised with an annual regatta. Wardleys Creek Regatta on the other side of the Wyre Estuary also offered races for the Jewel Class, as will as village sports such as wrestling.</p>\n<p>Lloyds Register records Diamond as being owned in 1928 by A.H.Mansergh who lived in the sea front at Bare in Morecambe. A.H.Mansergh was also a committee member of Wardley Regatta in 1912 and may have been her first owner . From 1930 she is recorded as being owned by F.W.Bury, a doctor of Queens Square, Lancaster who kept until at the least the Second World War. She is not recorded in Lloyds Register in 1947 or 1948.</p>","image_key":"FL7jMQ","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel Pitch Pine on sawn & bent oak frames","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":{"beam":2.081809314801268,"main":{"foot":4.26725188978298,"head":3.2004389173372347,"luff":3.2004389173372347},"thcf":0.887063898,"draft":0.9144111192392099,"topsail":{"luff":3.3528407705437697,"perpendicular":1.8288222384784198},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":7.010485247500609,"fore_triangle_base":4.57205559619605,"length_on_waterline":5.7912704218483295,"fore_triangle_height":5.7912704218483295},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.0104,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"","updated_at":"2022-02-17T22:59:40.894225+00:00","website":"","beam":2.0818,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"ownerships":{"owners":[{"name":"M Royle","share":64,"start":1988}]},"builder":"ff7b1629-680c-4aec-8744-70c7fea1a636","designer":"af328612-7ac5-4aa8-b1fb-a5a9e8620ef0","design_class":"c4ce9fdc-9170-48fd-baf1-e839d859150d","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Jewel"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Crossfield"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"unknown"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Crossfield","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
