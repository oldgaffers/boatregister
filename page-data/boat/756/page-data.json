Unfortunately due to a deterioration in his health he is now in residential care and rather sadly I find myself writing to you with a plea for finding a home for his beloved &lsquo;Dorothea&rsquo;, a 36 foot Gaff Cutter built by W E Thomas circa 1915.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently moored in Suffolk &lsquo;Dorothea&rsquo; sank following the recent freak tidal surge. My plea is simple, do you know of anyone who is interested in the salvage of her. Apart from having spent many happy family adventures on board her it seems a tragic waste to see her broken up, as is proposed if a new owner cannot be found. Please reply to me urgently as she will not last the winter on the slipway and will be scheduled for breaking up sooner rather than later.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.9624481833699097, "draft": 1.7678614971958058, "fore_triangle_base": 7.772494513533284, "fore_triangle_height": 14.73116313094367, "length_on_waterline": 10.36332601804438, "length_over_all": 11.430138990490123, "main": {"foot": 6.5532796878810045, "luff": 6.705681541087539}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 1.016110709, "topsail": {"luff": 6.4008778346744695, "perpendicular": 3.2766398439405022}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "London", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "a4e8edd1-ba13-4af7-b64e-682c5ee5b3f0", "length_on_deck": 11.43, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Dorothea", "oga_no": 756, "ownerships": [{"name": "W Humphries", "share": 64, "start": 1976}], "place_built": "Falmouth", "rig_type": "Cutter", "short_description": "", "uk_part1": "147568", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "website": "", "year": 1915, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/756"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
