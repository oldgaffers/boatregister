She was first registered in Plymouth in 1891 as PH 302. She is an early example of a Plymouth Hooker. She fished out of Polperro and other West Country ports until 1949 when she was sold as a yacht for the sum of &pound;185, a Willy&#39;s jeep (Teg. FDv 64) and a book of petrol coupons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1951 a survey shows she was partly decked with an open cockpit and a 1925 1 cylinder Bergius Co. engine. By 1958 she had a 19472 cylinder Thornecroft engine. In the mid 1970s she had a 20hp air cooled Lister engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979 Jim Curry refitted her including full decking, replacing parts of the keel, the stem and some replanking, tripling some frames and building a coachroof. Research at that time included a conversation with a 92 year old gent who remembered fishing on Spinaway in his youth. He had a fragile photograph of her and he quoted her as being the fastest piece of wood out of Polperro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996 Dave Blinkhorn interviewed JC Heal&#39;s son Philip and got some of the above information. He described her as a Looe Lugger. As a yacht she has spent time in the Irish Sea, and in Dave and Anna Blinkhorn&#39;s ownership sailed via Scotland, East Coast and the French Canals to the Mediterranean, ending up in Spain. She sailed back to the West Country in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Bob Aylott went sailing with her owners Andrew and Angela Hitt and crew Mike and Brian on the River Medina.
