She was first registered\nin Plymouth in 1891 as PH 302. She is an early example of a Plymouth Hooker.\nShe fished out of Polperro and other West Country ports until 1949 when she was\nsold as a yacht for the sum of \u00a3185, a Willy's jeep (Teg. FDv 64) and a book\nof petrol coupons.</p>\n<p>In 1951 a survey shows she was partly decked with an\nopen cockpit and a 1925 1 cylinder Bergius Co. engine. By 1958 she had a 1947 2\ncylinder Thornecroft engine. In the mid 1970s she had a 20hp air cooled Lister\nengine.</p>\n<p>In 1979 Jim Curry refitted her including full decking, replacing\nparts of the keel, the stem and some replanking, tripling some frames and building\na coach roof. Research at that time included a conversation with a 92 year old\ngent who remembered fishing on <em>Spinaway</em> in his youth. He had a fragile photograph\nof her and he quoted her as being the fastest piece of wood out of Polperro.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Dave Blinkhorn interviewed JC Heal's son Philip and got some of then\nabove information. He described her as a Looe Lugger. As a yacht she has spent\ntime in the Irish Sea, and in Dave and Anna Blinkhorn's ownership sailed via Scotland,\nEast Coast and the French Canals to the Mediterranean, ending up in Spain. She\nsailed back to the West Country in 2004.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Bob Aylott went sailing with her owners Andrew and Angela Hitt and crew\nMike and Brian on the River Medina.
