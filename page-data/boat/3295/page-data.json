She was first registered in\nPlymouth in 1891 as PH 302. She is an early example of a Plymouth Hooker. She\nfished out of Polperro and other West Country ports until 1949 when she was sold\nas a yacht for the sum of \u00a3185, a Willy's jeep (Teg. FDv 64) and a book of\npetrol coupons.</p>\n<p>In 1951 a survey shows she was partly decked with an open cockpit and a 1925 1\ncylinder Bergius Co. engine. By 1958 she had a 19472 cylinder Thornecroft\nengine. In the mid 1970s she had a 20hp air cooled Lister engine.</p>\n<p>In 1979 Jim Curry refitted her including full decking, replacing parts of the\nkeel, the stem and some replanking, tripling some frames and building a\ncoachroof. Research at that time included a conversation with a 92 year old gent\nwho remembered fishing on Spinaway in his youth. He had a fragile photograph of\nher and he quoted her as being the fastest piece of wood out of Polperro.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Dave Blinkhorn interviewed JC Heal's son Philip and got some of the\nabove information. He described her as a Looe Lugger. As a yacht she has spent\ntime in the Irish Sea, and in Dave and Anna Blinkhorn's ownership sailed via\nScotland, East Coast and the French Canals to the Mediterranean, ending up in\nSpain. She sailed back to the West Country in 2004.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Bob Aylott went sailing with her owners Andrew and Angela Hitt and crew\nMike and Brian on the River Medina.
