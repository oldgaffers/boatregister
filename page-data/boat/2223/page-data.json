Though the hull was sold by Eric Bergqvist in 1984, the fitting out was not finished till 1992. &#39;William&#39; has been&nbsp;kept at Burnham on Crouch since 1998 and sails in the Thames Estuary area between Dover and Woodbridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stability and windward performance of &#39;William&#39; has been improved by adding 16 foot of lead and glassing onto the bottom of the keel. The original mould was made without the iron shoe, making the keel about 4 inches shallower, affecting stability and windward performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1984, the hull was sold by Eric Bergqvist to her first owner in Torpoint, Devon. The owner spent six years fitting her out in his garden, but never sailed her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sold to an owner in West Mersea,&nbsp;Essex, in about 1990 who finished off the rig, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ballast and fitting out by about 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998 she was sold again to an owner based in London who keeps her in Burnham on Crouch.&nbsp;New hatches have been added and her interior rebuilt. Loose lead was taken out and recast as an extension to the keel making her draught about 3ft 9in, much improving stability and windward performance. A new mast and spars in aluminium have been installed, painted brown.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.8956352109241648, "length_over_all": 8.686905632772493}, "home_country": "null", "home_port": "Burnham on Crouch", "hull_form": "unknown", "id": "539ea2e2-426a-48ab-9417-b13688d8404c", "image_key": "VnrJtB", "length_on_deck": 8.6868, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "William", "oga_no": 2223, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 414, "member": 4252, "share": 64, "start": 1998}], "place_built": "Lymm", "rig_type": "Cutter", "short_description": "<p>&#39;William&#39;, launched in 1992,&nbsp;is one of the glassfibre replicas taken from the mould of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39;, the Morecambe Fisherman&rsquo;s lifeboat.&nbsp;</p>", "ssr": "86007", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-TSMh7Gz/0/Th/i-TSMh7Gz-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "website": "", "year": 1992, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2223"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
