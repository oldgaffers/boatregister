Though the hull was sold by Eric Bergqvist in 1984, the\nfitting out was not finished till 1992. 'William' has been\u00a0kept at\nBurnham-on-Crouch since 1998 and sails in the Thames Estuary area between Dover\nand Woodbridge.</p>\n<p>The stability and windward performance of 'William' has been improved by adding\n16 foot of lead and glassing onto the bottom of the keel. The original mould was\nmade without the iron shoe, making the keel about 4 inches shallower, affecting\nstability and windward performance.</p>\n<p>In 1984, the hull was sold by Eric Bergqvist to her first owner in Torpoint,\nDevon. The owner spent six years fitting her out in his garden, but never sailed\nher.</p>\n<p>She was sold to an owner in West Mersea,\u00a0Essex, in about 1990 who finished off\nthe rig, ballast and fitting out by about 1992.</p>\n<p>In 1998 she was sold again to an owner based in London who keeps her in\nBurnham-on-Crouch.\u00a0New hatches have been added and her interior rebuilt. Loose\nlead was taken out and recast as an extension to the keel making her draught\nabout 3ft 9in, much improving stability and windward performance. A new mast and\nspars in aluminium have been installed, painted brown.</p>", "generic_type": ["Yacht", "Lancashire Nobby"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.896, "draft": 1.372, "length_on_deck": 8.687, "length_on_waterline": 8.534, "length_over_all": 8.687}, "home_port": "Burnham-on-Crouch", "id": "539ea2e2-426a-48ab-9417-b13688d8404c", "image_key": "VnrJtB", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "William", "oga_no": 2223, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 414, "member": 4252, "share": 64, "start": 1998}], "place_built": "Lymm", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'William', launched in 1992,\u00a0is one of the glassfibre replicas taken from the\nmould of the 'Sir William Priestley', the Morecambe Fisherman\u2019s lifeboat.</p>", "ssr": "86007", "updated_at": "2024-10-10", "year": 1992, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2223"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
