Though the hull was sold by Eric Bergqvist in 1984, the fitting out was not finished till 1992. &#39;William&#39; has been&nbsp;kept at Burnham on Crouch since 1998 and sails in the Thames Estuary area between Dover and Woodbridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stability and windward performance of &#39;William&#39; has been improved by adding 16 foot of lead and glassing onto the bottom of the keel.

Loose lead was taken out and recast as an extension to the keel making her draught about 3ft 9in, much improving stability and windward performance. A new mast and spars in aluminium have been installed, painted brown.</p>","image_key":"VnrJtB","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-TSMh7Gz/0/Th/i-TSMh7Gz-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":"GRP Replica","draft":0,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"length_over_all":8.686905632772493},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.6868,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;William&#39;, launched in 1992,&nbsp;is one of the glassfibre replicas taken from the mould of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39;, the Morecambe Fisherman&rsquo;s lifeboat.&nbsp;</p>","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00","website":"","beam":2.8956,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"1bb81491-0c29-403b-9fc6-ac2b00e718f7","designer":"da4baa22-674e-4ea8-b2c5-14aee7286837","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"cold_moulded"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"William Crossfield"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Eric Bergqvist"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
