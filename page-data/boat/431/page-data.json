In 1897 she was owned by William Joseph Barbrook and William Joseph Barbrook Jnr. of Tollesbury and sailed with the family fleet until the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was to be called &#39;Ada&#39;, after a daughter of the family born in 1878, but her name was changed after the A and D were carved. ADC stands for Ada, Dick and Charlie, and she is reputed to have been the family&#39;s favourite boat, being renowned for her speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sold out of fishing in 1967, and her owner joined the recently-formed East Coast OGA. Re-rigged in the 1980s, she was rebuilt 1997 - 2000 and relaunched at Pin Mill, River Orwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to be in the 1970s, showing &#39;ADC&#39; taking part in the Thames Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend to Billingsgate, and celebrating her victory at the finish line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G9AGjkCnkDU\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>", "generic_type": "Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.6576, "draft": 1.7526, "length_on_deck": 13.716, "length_on_waterline": 11.887344550109729, "length_over_all": 13.716166788588149, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "fa573959-aa2c-4c29-884a-7e12c0b107e7", "image_key": "G4fGQK", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "ADC", "oga_no": 431, "ownerships": [{"end": 1997, "name": "A Harman", "share": 64, "start": 1967}], "place_built": "Brightlingsea", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>&#39;ADC&#39;, built in 1895 by Aldous of Brightlingsea fished with the Barbrook family until the 1930s.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-vDjLhD4/0/Th/i-vDjLhD4-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1895, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/431"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
