The interior was\u00a0professionally fitted and\nfinished during original construction and uses hardwoods and sapele faced ply.\nThere are ample cave lockers and a forward, deep sail locker.</p>\n<p>Built in 1997 as a cutter,\u00a0at some point the mast was moved forward to convert\nher to a sloop. A Yanmar\u00a0engine was fitted in 2003 and she was mainly used under\npower in the Plymouth Sound by her owner at that time. David Botterill purchased\nher in 2007 from Barbican Yacht Agency and had her fitted with a sea toilet in\nthe vacant heads and waste water seacock for the galley. In 2008 James Lawrence\nmade her a new headsail\u00a0and modified the existing mainsail to give more height\nin the cockpit. They also supplied new\u00a0running rigging. Tony MacKillican made a\nnew tiller. She proved to be an excellent sea boat and she cruised in the\nBristol Channel and\u00a0spent three summers in the Milford Haven.</p>\n<p>In 2013 she underwent a complete repaint of the hull and topsides including\ncoppercoat antifoul and non-slip finish on repainted deck and cockpit. All to\nhigh professional standards courtesy of Dave Freemantle at Cardiff Marine.\u00a0 All\nstanding rigging was replaced. A new cabin sole was cut in Robbins teak veneer.\nThe boom was extended by 2' at the goose neck to effect an overhang on the\ntransom (it didn't previously as a result of the mast being moved forward and\nwas consequently a bit difficult to stash in a marina or on a pontoon) and James\nLawrence made a new mainsail to take account of her new dimensions.</p>\n<p>If anything, she is better balanced on the tiller under sail than before as a\nresult of the changes to the boom length and the beautiful new mainsail.</p>\n<p>In 2013 she was on a river mooring in Keyhaven and sailed in the Solent during\nthat glorious summer to attend the OGA 50 Rally at Cowes. Her photo shows Denis,\nmy sailing buddy, and David Botterill, on the OGA Bristol Channel 'Up Channel'\nCruise\u00a0in June 2014 just off the Port of Cardiff. Since the photograph I have\nadded an anchor housing on the bowsprit enabling easier launch and retreival of\na Delta anchor. In 2017 Rudders Yard\u00a0upgraded her power source with a fixed\nsolar panel and auxillary battery wired through a new power switch. A new conrol\nlever and cable was fitted by the yard in 2018, along with fittings for a new\ntiller pilot. In the last few months I have continued to make her more friendly\nfor single handed sailing with all halyards and reefing lines leading to the\ncockpit. The topping lift leads to a cleat on the starboard cabin roof, the\nthroat and gaff halyard feed through a new Barton deck organiser and a pair of\nclutches on the port side.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.438, "checked": true, "draft": 0.914, "length_on_deck": 6.096, "length_on_waterline": 5.715}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Cardiff", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "9d530f05-0bd9-4032-aec3-6428d67fed16", "image_key": "f7HXWW", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Charlie", "oga_no": 1989, "ownerships": [{"end": 2007, "name": "Robert Ferris", "share": 64, "start": 2003}, {"end": 2024, "id": 551, "member": 4964, "share": 64, "start": 2007}, {"name": "", "note": "Purchased by David Botterill in 2007, Previously owned by Mr Rogert Ferris of Plymouth (2003-7).
