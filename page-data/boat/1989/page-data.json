Originally called&nbsp;a Mayfly Corsaire (Demonstrator no 2) she is now known as an Oystercatcher 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She sleeps three in the cabin&nbsp;(and two outside in the cockpit!) and is fitted with a sea toilet and small galley. The interior was&nbsp;professionally fitted and finished during original construction and uses hardwoods and sapele faced ply. There are ample cave lockers and a forward, deep sail locker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1997 as a cutter,&nbsp;at some point the mast was moved forward to convert her to a sloop. A Yanmar&nbsp;engine was fitted in 2003 and she was mainly used under power in the Plymouth Sound by her owner at that time. David Botterill purchased her in 2007 from Barbican Yacht Agency and had her fitted with a sea toilet in the vacant heads and waste water seacock for the galley. In 2008 James Lawrence made her a new headsail&nbsp;and modified the existing mainsail to give more height in the cockpit. They also supplied new&nbsp;running rigging. Tony MacKillican made a new tiller. She proved to be an excellent sea boat and she cruised in the Bristol Channel and&nbsp;spent three summers in the Milford Haven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 she underwent a complete repaint of the hull and topsides including coppercoat antifoul and non-slip finish on&nbsp;repainted deck and cockpit. All to&nbsp;high professional standards courtesy of Dave Freemantle at Cardiff Marine. Her exterior hardwood was stripped back and treated with International Woodskin. All&nbsp;standing rigging was replaced. A new cabin sole was cut in Robbins teak veneer. The boom was extended by 2&#39; at the goose neck to effect an overhang on the transom (it didn&#39;t previously as a result of the mast being moved forward and was consequently a bit difficult to stash in a marina or on a pontoon) and James Lawrence made a new mainsail&nbsp;to take account of her new dimensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She did have&nbsp;a lovely boom crutch made from recycled pine gym bars (that also suppied the extra two foot of boom shaped, and epoxied by Dennis). Unfortunatelty they twisted and snapped in a storm in late 2019 finally prompting me to design and have fabricated a galvanised version.&nbsp;If anything, she is better balanced on the tiller under sail than before as a result of the changes to the boom length and the beautiful new mainsail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 she was on a river mooring in Keyhaven and sailed in the Solent during that glorious summer to attend the OGA 50 Rally at Cowes. Her photo shows Denis, my sailing buddy, and David Botterill, on the OGA Bristol Channel &#39;Up Channel&#39; Cruise&nbsp;in June 2014 just off the Port of Cardiff. Since the photograph I have added an anchor housing on the bowsprit enabling easier launch and retreival of a Delta anchor. In 2017 Rudders Yard&nbsp;upgraded her power source with a fixed solar panel and auxillary battery wired through a new power switch. A new conrol lever and cable was fitted by the yard in 2018, along with fittings for a new tiller pilot. In the last few months I have continued to make her more friendly for single handed sailing with all halyards and reefing lines leading to the cockpit. The topping lift leads to a cleat on the starboard cabin roof, the throat and gaff halyard feed through a new Barton deck organiser and a pair of clutches on the port side.</p>","image_key":"f7HXWW","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":null,"draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.43842965130456,"length_over_all":6.0960741282613995},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.096,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Built in 1997, &#39;Charlie&#39; is&nbsp;of GRP construction in the hull and decks, with extensive use of hardwood finishes. &#39;Charlie&#39;s&#39; home port is&nbsp;the Cardiff Bay Yacht Club in Cardiff Bay.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:39:26.207633+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"2a625108-bef9-404e-bf02-4aad488efa47","designer":"0a7e6fb2-e0ca-4d35-b34c-367dfb4d9056","design_class":"2e74e933-b6b6-419b-95b4-ca0ffedea264","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"cold_moulded"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Oystercatcher 20"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Bryan Gibson"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Sloop"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Mayfly Classic Boats"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
