One is the use of bronze bolts and\nscrews instead of the original iron centre line fixings and bronze nails for the\nplanking to frame fixings.</p>\n<p>Another difference is the deck. <em>Polly Agatha's</em> consists of\ntwo layers of marine plywood sheathed in epoxy and glass overlaid with 3 inch\nwide teak. This was chosen to increase strength, stiffness and durability.</p>\n<p>In building this replica some external features of the original were reintroduced\nwhich have been lost on the <em>Peggy</em>, with the intent of enhancing her beautiful lines.</p>\n<p>The internal layout is optimised for her intended role as a sea school and finished\nin solid English oak. The master cabin is luxurious with an en-suite head and shower.\nThere is a traditional head in the bow and a forward cabin with two berths and two extra\noccasional berths. The saloon has another four berths including two occasional\non the saloon seats, providing a total of ten berths.</p>\n<p>There is a large galley and navigational area fully equipped with modern technology\nincluding everything needed to licence the boat as a sea school.</p>", "generic_type": ["Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter", "Yacht"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 4.115, "draft": 2.286, "fore_triangle_base": 8.23, "fore_triangle_height": 12.802, "length_on_deck": 13.716, "length_on_waterline": 12.162, "length_over_all": 13.719, "main": {"foot": 8.839, "head": 7.059, "luff": 8.601}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 1.135813834, "topsail": {"luff": 9.501, "perpendicular": 4.401}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Royal Clarence Marina - Gosport", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "image_key": "qKN6QP", "lastModified": "2023-12-10T13:01:25Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Polly Agatha", "oga_no": 2856, "ownerships": [{"end": 2019, "name": "Kim Hartley", "share": 64, "start": 2007}, {"name": "Mark Boardman", "share": 64, "start": 2019}], "place_built": "Falmouth", "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "PA", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p><em>Polly Agatha</em> is an exact replica of the Bristol pilot cutter, Peggy, built in Falmouth, 2007.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "uk_part1": "916036", "updated_at": "2025-11-13", "website": "http://www.polly-agatha.co.uk/", "year": 2007, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2856"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
