My reality check came when I realised I was in my early sixties; our daughters were grown up, and worse, my 1850&rsquo;s, Noman&rsquo;s Land Boat, built on Galiano Island BC, in 1978 was approaching almost 30 years old.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nDuring the previous 29 years I had worked, brought up a family and fitted the boat with three engines. The first was a new 1976 British Seagull Silver Century, side mounted aft of the mizzen mast. The engine was adequate, although it produced slightly less than the required horse power needed to attain the boat&rsquo;s hull speed. This problem was accentuated by a side mount, a manufactured one size fits all, bracket which added to the loss of horsepower. That engine was later reworked and converted into an inboard, but the lack of horsepower remained an irritating problem, and one I lived with for several years.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nAbout 1985, I was enthusiastically restoring several antique farm tractors; nothing like 500 (plus) cubic inch, two cylinder, John Deer engines to make one realize there really is a God internal combustion! This restoration work took me to a number of antique equipment shows and swap meets throughout the Pacific Northwest.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nOn one of these excursions I picked up three 1947 Briggs &amp; Stratton marine engines for $75.00 and over several months was able to produce one fine engine with an almost unlimited number of spare parts. This was a heavy cast iron engine and once fitted in Northern Star&rsquo;s aft, left very little room for anything else. It was a beautiful engine that included a water pump operating through a belt drive to keep the water cooled exhaust,at operating temperature. Although the engine&rsquo;s five horse power was ideal for maintaining the boat&rsquo;s hull speed I lived in fear of a mechanical problem with the pump and the cries of &ldquo;Fire Down Below&rdquo; from the crew.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nI decided it was again time to change engines and opted for another British Seagull, but one with enough horse power to drive the boat at hull speed. After numerous email enquiries and phone calls, I bought one from West Coast Contractors of San Francisco California. The company has a good reputation and in business for decades. By late November I received my new 1973 British Seagull, Silver Century Plus WSPCL.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nAlthough the engine had been tested by Sean, the owner of West Coast Contractors and I was assured it was in excellent condition, I&rsquo;d already decided that Northern Star was going to be completely refitted and would be a wooden boat festival winning classic boat. This meant that the engine also had to look like a piece of sculpture, and by late December 2006 I started in earnest on the engine&rsquo;s complete restoration.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nUnder all that dirt, paint and grime British Seagull actually did have some fine castings, which is particularly true of the Amal carburetor, if one takes the time to polish it. Over the next few weeks the engine was completely stripped, cleaned, polished, machined, painted and re-assembled. All painted parts were airbrushed with three coats of primer and five coats of High Gloss Engine Enamel from Bill Hirsch Automotive, Newark NJ USA. Incidentally, although not cheap these are the finest automotive paints I&rsquo;ve ever used and are extremely resistant to heat, gasoline and oil. All paint was applied using a professional quality Paasche air brush attached to a DeWalt compressor fitted with in line air filters and water trap.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nAll machining was carried out on a Myford Super Seven lathe and a small bench top milling machine. All parts cleaned sanded and then painted with three coats of primer each wet sanded between coats and five coats of enamel. The Amal carburetor was polished, cleaned internally and refitted with 24: 1 jets replacing the original 10:1 mixture jets. Anyone that&rsquo;s operated a Seagull in a following wind will understand my reasons for this conversion.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nThe engine&rsquo;s restoration was scheduled to take several days, but like most hobbyist, my time is of little value, and by the time it was finished so was most of February; I was already concerned the boat would not be ready for summer!</blockquote><blockquote>\r\n<h3>Refitting the boat</h3>\r\nThe first job was to remove all pitch from the between the deck planks. Northern Star&rsquo;s deck is made of 184 pieces, a veritable wood puzzle! There was no way around it, and was a job that required the mind turned off, the radio turned on and go to it with a putty knife for the next few weeks.<br />\r\nNext the hull was completely stripped of years of paint, sanded and prepared for her new finish. While this was going on my oldest granddaughter Anysha, Northern Star&rsquo;s next Master, spent days inside the hull and under the fore and aft decks, sanding, scraping, oiling and varnishing.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nThe iron wood center board was removed and inspected and new anti fouling paint was applied to the inside of the casing and the center board before reinstallation. While working on the hull I also built a larger rudder with about a 20% more below waterline surface area. I also built a custom made engine side mount for the Seagull engine from Ironwood.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nWhile all this was going on, I decided it was time to replace the now rather baggy canvas sails with new sails made of more modern materials. Finally I made new brass nameplates to be fitted port and starboard of the hull.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\n<h3>Specifications of paints and varnishes used on hull and spars</h3>\r\nHull exterior (above water line) - 5 coats of primer; seven coats of enamel, sanded between coats final sanding to 400 grit before final enamel applied.<br />\r\nHull exterior (below water line) 3 coats of anti fouling paint Interior of hull five coats of spar varnish wet sanded to 600 grit; other areas oiled.<br />\r\nDeck &ndash; machine sanded to 400 grit; hand sanded to 600 grit; Finish 3 coats of Brazilian Rose Oil Main &amp; Mizzen masts, yards and tiller. &ndash; 2 coats of pre varnish; 17 coats of high gloss varnish wet sanded to 600 grit between coats. Final coat wet sanded (progressively) to 1000 grit.</blockquote><blockquote>\r\nDue to several setbacks while I carried out the work it was late summer before the job was completed and unfortunately a summer&rsquo;s sailing was lost. However Northern star is now one of the finest and most beautiful classics sailing the Pacific Northwest and a boat that is constantly admired and photographed when she is under sail.</blockquote>","image_key":"psXNxK","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Lap strake yellow cedar on white oak","draft":0,"generic_type":"Dinghy","handicap_data":{"length_overall":5.6388},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.6388,"mainsail_type":"lug","sail_type":{"name":"lug"},"short_description":"New built replica of a boat described in H I Chapelle 'American Small Sailing Craft'.","updated_at":"2021-01-26T12:26:35.926503+00:00","website":"","beam":1.6764,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"775a4b5b-de7d-49b9-aba4-49ce72b5293b","designer":null,"design_class":"c9359cd6-cf19-4f3a-beb5-3b5421e25607","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"No Mans Land Boat"},"designerByDesigner":null,"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Ketch"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Dinghy"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Foster Greg of Whaler Bay Boatworks","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
