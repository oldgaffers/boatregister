She has an inboard 50HP Nainni diesel engine with a cruising speed of 6 knots. The wheelhouse was added in the 1980s without having to make any alteration to the rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Avola&#39; cruises extensively in Northern Europe, the Baltic and Russia. At the Shipmate Classic Yacht Regatta in 2007 she won the prestigious Shipmate of Tradition Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her name comes from a town in Sicily famous for its wine from Nero d&rsquo;Avola grapes. At the invasion of Sicily on 10 July 1943 about 75 troops of the British 50th division of the 8th Army landed at Avola. The original owner was one of the first to set foot at Avola, and later named his boat to remember the occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, &#39;Avola&#39; celebrated her 50th birthday in style on both sides of the North Sea with the East Coast OGA and on a cruise in the Netherlands.
