I was given the dinghy when it was in poor condition with many split lands but restored it using epoxy (see PBO article August 2020 Restoring a Bembridge Scow. This article is also available on the internet). I have also put in Mahogany side thwarts to make her more comfortable to sit in. She traditionally had an orange lug sail but this was rotten so I replaced it with a new white sail with No 4 on it.  She has a small foredeck. <p> Now fully restored she  sails very well.
