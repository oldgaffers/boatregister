Her hull was built\nby Fabian Bush according to a design by Paul Fisher, based on a Mevagissey\nTosher, and everything else was fitted out by her first owner, Bernard Patrick.\nSo <em>Molly</em> is unique! Her hull is epoxy-glued clinker plywood over laminated ash\nframes. There are two full-length bunks (a spare for a temporary crew, or to\nkeep a folding bike on!) as well as a 5hp Mercury outboard and a two burner and\ngrill gas cooker. She has mainsail, staysail, jib and asymmetric sails plus\ncockpit cover, sail cover, boom tent and all-over cover (for use ashore), also\nboatyard trailer. She has been very well maintained. She is a brilliant boat for\nsingle-handed sailing, very comfortable and great fun. She slips along in\nimperceptibly light airs on flat water, but keeps me well protected if we find\nourselves out in a Force 6. I hope her next custodian is reading this! I am\nplanning to sail at Milford Haven with the Round Britain boats in May, then to\ntake her up the Bristol Channel, motor across country along the Kennet and Avon\ncanal and down the Thames, then come round the coast to Ipswich for the\ncelebrations at the end of the RBC60 in August. Anyone who thinks <em>Molly</em> might\nbe the boat they are looking for is welcome to arrange to come to see and sail\non her during this season, and I will be ready to bid her a fond farewell come\nautumn.</p>", "seller_gold_id": 776, "seller_member": 5793, "updated_at": "2023-02-17T16:57:55.858Z"}], "full_description": "<p>Molly Cobbler's lines were drawn by naval architecht Paul Fisher as a result of\na commission to produce an open gaff cutter based on a traditional Mevagissey\nTosher fishing boat, but with a lifting keel and modern construction.
