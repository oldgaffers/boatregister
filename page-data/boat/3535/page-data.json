During her active service as a lifeboat she sailed\n411 times and 540 people were rescued. In 1929 the boat was extended by 1.30 m and\nthe 15 cm rubber fender was installed all around. Until 1930 the Hilda\nwas in service around the isle of Schiermonnikoog with skipper Mees Toxopeus,\nand after this she moved to the Lemmer station before leaving the service in\n1975. Once out of active service the <em>Hilda</em> was converted into a 2 masts\nsailing yacht, with a cruising ground that stretched from the Isle of Wight to\nCopenhagen. About 2002 the boat was completely stripped and fitted with a new\nengine. She was found in deplorable condition in 2008 and converted into a\npleasure yacht at the yard S.R.F in Harlingen. Since then, trips have been made\nwith the <em>Hilda</em> in European inland and coastal waters.   Her current owners\npurchased her in 2018, giving her a \"technical update\" which involved renewing\nthe mast and plates in the hull, installing motor inside cooling, and a second\nplotter and VHF. In 2021 <em>Hilda</em> sailed to Oslo-Norway. <em>Hilda</em> is registered\nwith the Nautical Association Olde Resque Glory.</p>\n<p>Length Originally 14.20 m, width 3.90 m, draft 0.90 cm, Now 15.50/4.25/1.10-1.20 m\nDisplacement 23 tonnes, 15 watertight compartments.
