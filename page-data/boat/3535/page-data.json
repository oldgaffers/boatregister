During her active service as a lifeboat she sailed 411\ntimes and 540 people were rescued.   In 1929 the boat was extended by 1.30 m and\nthe 15 cm rubber fender was installed all around. Until 1930 the Hilda was in\nservice around the isle of Schiermonnikoog with skipper Mees Toxopeus, and after\nthis she moved to the Lemmer station before leaving the service in 1975.   Once\nout of active service \u00a0the <em>Hilda</em> was converted into a 2 masts sailing yacht,\nwith a cruising ground that stretched from the Isle of Wight to Copenhagen.\nAbout 2002 the boat was completely stripped and fitted with a new engine.   She\nwas found in deplorable condition in 2008 and converted into a pleasure yacht at\nthe yard S.R.F in Harlingen. Since then, trips have been made with the <em>Hilda</em>\non European inland and coastal waters.   Her current owners purchased her in\n2018, \u00a0giving her a \"technical update\" \u00a0which involved renewing the mast and\nplates in the hull, installing motor inside cooling, and a second plotter and\nVHF. In 2021 <em>Hilda</em> sailed to Oslo-Norway.   <em>Hilda</em> is registered with the\nNautical Association Olde Resque Glory.</p>\n<p>Length Originally 14.20 m, width 3.90 m, draft 0.90 cm, Now 15.50/4.25/1.10-1.20\nm   Displacement 23 tons, 15 watertight compartments.
