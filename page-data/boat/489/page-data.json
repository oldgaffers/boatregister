She packed so much into her short life that the owner was inspired to &nbsp;“get on with it” and complete the project. The matter was finally &nbsp;decided when the owner's gardening book told him that Bryony is of no use &nbsp;in the garden.</p>\n<p>She was re-launched in July 2017 and is now based in Saltash.</p>","image_key":"DWq95d","uk_part1":"185665","spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Pitch pine on oak","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.7432333577176298,"main":{"foot":6.4008778346744695,"head":5.4864667154352595,"luff":4.26725188978298},"thcf":1.01759888,"draft":1.5240185320653499,"topsail":{"luff":4.87685930260912,"perpendicular":2.13362594489149},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":10.05852231163131,"fore_triangle_base":5.7912704218483295,"length_on_waterline":9.1441111923921,"fore_triangle_height":9.1441111923921},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.0584,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:38:43.746907+00:00","website":"","beam":2.7432,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"764e5547-70f4-455f-bdc8-4f84474a532d","designer":"360ae854-6e8c-41ef-a6b2-731ff1fe0380","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"H.
