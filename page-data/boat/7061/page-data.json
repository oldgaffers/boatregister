A surveyor&#39;s report of 2004 states:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The origin and early history of Quintet are well documented in the entries of Lloyds Register of Yachts. It appears that she has excellent provenance. She is also remarkably free of clumsy DIY modifications that often plague older boats and eventually lead to their loss of character and watertight integrity. In her 51 years afloat Quintet has been fortunate to have had few different owners. Maintenance work over the years has been far-reaching and extensive. Past projects have included such major items as dropping the keel and replacing the bolts, burning off all the paint and building up again from scratch, re-decking with plywood over the tongue and groove layer, re-engining, replacing the rudder and numerous smaller projects. This has all been enormously effective in keeping her at an excellent standard for her age.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, her skipper Clive undertook a circumnavigation of England with crew-member Les, departing Fosdyke in mid-June and returning mid-September. <a href=\"http://www.2oldgitsinaboat.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full story at &#39;Two old gits in a boat&#39;</a>.</p>","image_key":"k9jQVg","uk_part1":"186524","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel construction, mahogany planks on oak frames.","draft":1.3716,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"main":{"foot":5.18166300902219,"luff":11.277737137283589},"thcf":0.960829605,"draft":1.2710314557425018,"length_over_all":9.473299195318214,"fore_triangle_base":4.26725188978298,"length_on_waterline":7.924896366739819,"fore_triangle_height":12.192148256522799},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.7018,"mainsail_type":"bermudan","sail_type":{"name":"bermudan"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Quintet&#39;, a traditional cutter, with Bermudan rig, was built in 1953 to a design from the drawing board of Reg Freeman of Hordle near Lymington.
