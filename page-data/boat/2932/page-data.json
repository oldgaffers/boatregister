It was in 1898\nthat the Maldon 'Transcur' did not appear in the register and 'Transcur CK 365'\nwas first registered.</p>\n<p>Her early history is rather vague and the only thing we know is that she worked\nfrom the Essex River Crouch and was owned by the Smith Brothers, well known\noyster merchants of the area. In 1924 she came out of the register and was sold\nfor conversion to a yacht. Coamings and skylights were added. In 1937 her first\nengine was fitted on the starboard quarter. She passed through several hands,\neach owner keeping her for approximatly five years. Most of this time was spent\non the east coast of England.</p>\n<p>In 1998 the Thomas family bought Transcur from Lymington on the Solent where she\nhad been for 19 years. Not in a sound enough condition to be sailed back to the\neast coast, she came back overland to the front garden where the family spent\nthe next two years restoring her, keeping the floors but the rest of the boat\nwas so rotten it needed replacing. She was returned to her original gaff rig\nwhich she lost in the late 50s. Since her restoration she has been sailed\nregularly to Holland each year for family holidays.</p>\n<p>Unlike many smacks, she is sailed by a family and cruised extensivly.</p>", "generic_type": "Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.28, "checked": true, "displacement": 12200, "draft": 1.396, "fore_triangle_base": 7.315, "fore_triangle_height": 10.058, "length_on_deck": 10.796, "length_on_waterline": 8.687, "main": {"foot": 7.163, "head": 5.105, "luff": 5.078}, "propellor": {"blades": 2, "type": "folding"}, "sailarea": 81.065, "solent": {"hull_shape": "Long keel - High volume", "measured_rating": 27.366227149763233, "thcf": 1.024}, "thcf": 1.024, "topsail": {"luff": 6.706, "perpendicular": 2.438}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Pin Mill", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "656e0e94-c298-408e-90e2-1bafd5bdd824", "image_key": "grRdbV", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Transcur", "oga_no": 2932, "ownerships": [{"name": "Frank Mulville", "share": 64, "start": 1965}, {"id": 252, "member": 3336, "share": 64, "start": 1970}, {"name": "Rober Bettle", "share": 64, "start": 1975}, {"current": true, "id": 38, "member": 954, "share": 64, "start": 1998}], "place_built": "Brightlingsea", "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "CK365", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'Transcur' was built in 1889 as an oyster dredger working on the east coast of\nEngland.
