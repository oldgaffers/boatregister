She is likely to have been constructed as a fishing\n vessel though her overall proportions and rakish stem might suggest lines of a yacht;\n or at least having been rebuilt along\n the lines of a yacht in later life. Of course, Crossfield was known to produce\n both fishing boats and yachts, and whilst the archives have yet to reveal <em>Charlotte's</em>\n earliest history, her construction with robust grown oak frames, long keel and\n shallow draught speak of working-boat heritage in the north west coastal region\n of England.</p>\n<p>What is sure is that by 1975 she was lying on her side\n in a boat yard at Watermouth Cove, North Devon. Julian Lamb recalls that,\n as a young lad, he fell in love with <em>Charlotte&rsquo;s</em> elegant abandoned\n hull and spent many hours playing on her decks and in the cockpit during regular\n camping holidays from the Midlands.  Returning each year, he went looking\n for <em>Charlotte</em>.  In 1977, he discovered she had been renovated:\n fresh paint, new rigging, and upright once more.  In 1979, she was afloat\n and moored in the cove, but in 1980 she had gone: and Julian didn&rsquo;t see\n her again at Watermouth. </p>\n<p><em>Charlotte</em> had been bought by brothers Ray and Mike Johnson in Cardiff and in 1980\n she was on a 'trot mooring' at Cardiff Yacht Club.  Graham Cuthill, a long-term friend\n of the brothers recalls that <em>Charlotte</em> was actually in poor condition\n and a third brother, Jim, was appalled at the state of her.  Work was carried-out\n to keep her afloat including some new planking and reinforcement of cracked frames.<br />\n During this period, her decks and cabin were also rebuilt and her sheer aft raised\n by several inches.</p>\n<p>When Ray Johnson died aged in his 50s, brother\n Jim stepped in to help Mike continue with the boat.  Ray&rsquo;s ashes were\n placed in a purpose made wooden box and, together with another box containing\n the ashes of a sailing friend, Fred Patterson, they were wedged into <em>Charlotte&rsquo;s</em>\n deck beams.  Whilst <em>Charlotte</em> was occasionally under sail she was\n often used as a place for the friends to gather and drink tea with her ex-British\n Rail coal stove providing warmth on cold days.</p>\n<p>By 2015 she was still\n afloat but very tired.  When the last Johnson brother died a plan was devised\n by local gaffer enthusiasts to save and restore her.  The Charlotte Restoration\n Group was formed &ndash; soon to be known as the Charlotteers &ndash; and accommodation\n was found in the workshop at World of Boats in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Hope was\n high that she could be returned to the water with only light recommissioning work. \n However, as is often the case, close inspection revealed that she needed major\n rebuilding of frames and planking. The Charlotteers committed to the rebuild and\n she was stripped and dissembled with all usable parts placed into storage. \n One or two planks at the sheer line were left in place with a scaffold of stout\n batons to ensure her hull remained in shape.  Her frames were removed one\n at a time and remade using green oak obtained from Coedcochwyn Park near Cardiff\n and her stern post was remade using wood from a lock gate. Regrettably, World\n of Boats ceased trading in 2018 and the future for <em>Charlotte</em> became\n uncertain. Options to relocate <em>Charlotte</em> were explored but none seemed\n ideal.  Work continued into 2019 and by some remarkable happenstance a new\n custodian stepped forward: Julian Lamb &ndash; the lad who had played on her decks\n over forty years earlier.</p>\n<p><em>Charlotte</em> had gained something\n of a folklore status in Julian's family - she was his first love after\n which many restoration projects followed: classic cars, houses and even an aeroplane. \n One Sunday afternoon in 2019 Julian recounted the story of <em>Charlotte</em>\n to his youngest son, Ted, who then searched her out on the internet.  Julian\n was astonished to discover she still existed and was in need of assistance. \n Contact was established with the Charlotteers and a trip to Cardiff was arranged\n to see <em>Charlotte</em> again.  Several return trips followed, including\n one with an 18-ton HIAB lorry!  Over the autumn of 2019 <em>Charlotte</em>\n was transported to the Midlands to start the next phase of her restoration.  </p>\n<p>Julian has a background in engineering and industrial archaeology and says\n that enjoyment of <em>Charlotte&rsquo;s</em> restoration is the most important\n objective: it is not about a rush to the finish line.  Having said this,\n he plans to sail her from Watermouth Cove sometime between 2025 and 2030 to\n mark fifty years since he played on her decks as a child. </p>\n<p>If you know anything about <em>Charlotte&rsquo;s</em> life prior to 1975 Julian would\n be delighted to hear from you. \"</p>", "generic_type": ["Lancashire Nobby", "Morecambe Bay Prawner"], "handicap_data": {"length_on_deck": 8.3058, "length_over_all": 8.305900999756156}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Cardiff", "id": "9462e38c-4b99-4a0a-a038-b47ff1c28711", "image_key": "BwqFN4", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Charlotte", "oga_no": 1615, "ownerships": [{"name": "G Batten", "share": 64, "start": 1975}, {"note": "Advertised for sale, 1977, in Gaffers Log: Ilfracombe owned by G.
