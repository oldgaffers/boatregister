This class was first designed in 1897\nfor the Orwell Corinthian Yacht Club to provide an easily handled boat that did\nnot require paid crew. They were later adopted by the Royal Burnham Yacht Club.\nBy 1907 there were ten on the Orwell and six on the Crouch who regularly used to\nsail against each other. By 1996 only 'Raffles' remained in sailing order and a\nmould was taken from 'May' to form the basis of the updated version which can\neasily be trailed.</p>\n<p>The first replica was called 'First of May'.
