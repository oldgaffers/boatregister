This class was first designed in 1897 for the Orwell Corinthian Yacht Club to provide an easily handled boat that did not require paid crew. They were later adopted by the Royal Burnham Yacht Club. By 1907 there were ten on the Orwell and six on the Crouch who regularly used to sail against each other. By 1996 only &#39;Raffles&#39; remained in sailing order and a mould was taken from &#39;May&#39; to form the basis of the updated version which can easily be trailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first replica was called &#39;First of May&#39;. Apart from the use of modern materials and a lifting keel for easier trailing she replicates the original.
