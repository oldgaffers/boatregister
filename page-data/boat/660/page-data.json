She is 8ft 5ins on the beam, draws 4ft 3ins and with her Oregon pine bowsprit shipped is 32ft long. She has a waterline length of 23ft and is constructed of pitch pine on oak, copper fastened with marine ply decks, epoxy sheathed and professionally laid in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has a cast iron ballast keel and internal pigs of lead ballast. &#39;Wendy May&#39; was fitted with a Vetus 206 twin-cylinder 15 HP diesel engine in 1999. Below she has a sink with brass pump tap to port and a chart table to starboard, two settee berths with sitting headroom and about 6ft headroom beneath a central butterfly hatch. The saloon is also fitted with a Taylors 079/KB heater. Amidships to port behind a bulkhead is the galley consisting of a Taylors 028 two burner cooker. To starboard amidships is a head. In the focs&rsquo;le are two further berths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a 2010 survey which concludes: &lsquo;Wendy May has been found to be a very good example of a yacht from the 1930s. The structure is in sound condition. Where restoration or replacement has been carried out, the work has been to a good standard.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Wendy May&#39; has been sailed extensively to Brittany, round Britain and Ireland and across the North Sea to the Netherlands. She was described when launched as being &lsquo;dry and well able to heave-to, with sitting headroom beneath wide side-decks and with bulwarks 9ins high. In short a hard-weather packet.&rsquo;</p>","image_key":"rQR8nj","uk_part1":"166077","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine on oak","draft":1.3716,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.590831504511095,"main":{"foot":4.419653742989515,"head":2.8956352109241648,"luff":4.495854669592782},"thcf":0.910541061,"draft":1.3716166788588149,"topsail":{"luff":2.8956352109241648,"perpendicular":1.3716166788588149},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":7.772494513533284,"fore_triangle_base":5.6388685686417945,"length_on_waterline":7.010485247500609,"fore_triangle_height":7.162887100707144},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.7724,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;Wendy May&#39; is the last of four sister ships, built in 1936, based on Maurice Griffiths&#39; design &#39;Olive Mary&#39;.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:38:48.726393+00:00","website":"","beam":2.5908,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"28fd53d4-bb37-4584-be38-268a7296d656","designer":"956ab338-19b7-4d90-9e8d-d3cecd98fe9e","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Maurice Griffiths"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Williams and Parkinson"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":13500}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
