One notable charterer was\nJohn Profumo using her as a cruising boat. During her time on the Crouch, she\nunderwent a major restoration. Her owner was a shipwright and was based up the\nriver at Fambridge. She went on the market to allow her owner to purchase a\nboat more suited to long-distance cruising.</p>\n<p>In May 2007, she was purchased by Barry Dunning and Bob Fisher, who, as part\nof the purchasing deal, arranged for her to be brought from the Crouch to\nLymington. It was at this point that Rosenn reverted from cruising boat to\nracing boat her new owners were more interested in that aspect of the sport and\na gradual metamorphosis began.</p>\n<p>More recently she has been bought by Peter &amp; Victoria Bonham Christie who gave her\nback her original name.
