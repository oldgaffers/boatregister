Holmes was an East Coast man who worked in close communicaton with Albert Strange so it remains obscure as to why she has Morecambe Bay Prawner features.

She was laid up at Menai Bridge during the First World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war she spent most of her time before 1939 owned by Mr King who sailed her out of Caernarfon, when he died in the late 1930s he willed &#39;Wender&#39; to two sisters who left her with Dickie&#39;s of Bangor for the duration of the Second World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was discovered there by H.R. Davies in a poor condition. He bought her for &pound;55 and with a friend Mr Hughes had Dickie&#39;s work on her.
