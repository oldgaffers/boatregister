Robin Williams was given copies of the Morgan Giles drawings by John Hall, boatyard owner in Walton-on-the-Naze. On the sad passing of co-owner, Les Bowen, Robin was bequeathed mast, spars, some rigging and sails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sail has enabled us to confirm the record in the Boat Register, curiously having the &#39;7&#39; in a different and older fabric. The last One Design to be built was No.&#39;7&#39; and on joining the OGA the boat was given boat no. 473, which became her new sail number, we can only assume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rebuild is still underway at Robin&#39;s workshop in Buckfastleigh, Devon, with her original ballast keel, bronze fittings and spars (except the boom), based on the original drawings.</p>", "generic_type": "Dinghy", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.8288, "draft": 1.3716, "length_on_deck": 5.4864, "length_on_waterline": 5.18166300902219, "length_over_all": 5.4864667154352595}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Buckfastleigh, Devon (ashore)", "hull_form": "centre-board dinghy", "id": "73125ed3-5ee1-489b-9925-15f2fe5f16df", "image_key": "DDc8cm", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Pierce Eye", "oga_no": 473, "ownerships": [{"end": 1984, "name": "Les Bowen", "share": 64, "start": 1963}, {"name": "Robin Williams", "share": 64, "start": 1980}, {"name": "P A Heighway", "share": 64, "start": 1984}], "place_built": "Walton-on-the-Naze", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "7, 473", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Pierce Eye is a Walton One Design, built in 1921 by Brooke and Hall with sail no. 7.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-T8MCGT4/0/Th/i-T8MCGT4-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1921, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/473"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
