In the early '50s she was on the Solent and came\n2nd in the Old Boat Class, 1975 Fastnet Race.</p>\n<p>In 1988 she was sold in Italy, where she underwent a major restoration, and has been\nthere for many years, her home port being Trieste, at the north end of the Adriatic\nand then Turkey until 2017 when she was moved to Aegina, Greece.</p>\n<h3>A wooden gaffer amongst 1,999 GRP Bermudans</h3>\n<p>by Piero Tassinari, in Penarth, South Wales First published in Gaffers Log, June 2007</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is now the second winter since I moved from Italy, and still \u2018Moya\u2019, \nthe old Morecambe Bay 43ft gaffer which I have been skippering these last years, \nis being cradled by the smooth waters of the Northern Adriatic. The Bristol Channel is \nchallenging from a sailing point of view; the tidal range is a fascinating monstrosity \nto a Mediterranean mind, and the brownness of the water holds the inscrutability of \ntrue poetry, but... no, I cannot take \u2018Moya\u2019 to Wales now. I am committed to another \nproject (a typical \u2018good restoration opportunity\u2019), and, after all, I am not her owner.</p>\n<p>I have sailed her during long summer cruises which have taken us from Trieste, \nin the far north end of the Adriatic, to the Aegean - 2,000 miles a year. So perfect \ncruises that the epicurean owner \u2013 alarmed from my reports \u2013 has persuaded himself \nthat he prefers the crystal-clear waters of Southern Dalmatia and Eptanese to the \nmuddy charms of the Severn.</p>\n<p>\u2018Moya\u2019 is a strong boat, gifted with innate elegance and immense character. \nAccommodation is slightly cramped, but under sail she has the true pace of a little \nship. Thoroughbred qualities, which have made her survive nearly a century of sailing.\n It was 1910 when she was launched at Arnside, Lancashire \u2013 a creature of the renowned \n shipyard of William Crossfield. The French Canals led her to the Mediterranean in 1988 \n and, after a fastidious restoration, there she was, ready for a new season of cruising \n and racing.</p>\n<p>This last summer was timed by the legs of a cruise along Dalmatia, Albania, Apulia, \nthe Ionian Islands and the Corinth Channel, just for the sake of a look around the Aegean. \nAnd it was a long way to get back in time to take part to the last event of the season, \nthe \u2018Barcolana\u2019 race in Trieste.</p>\n<p>Now in its 38th year, the \u2018Barcolana\u2019 is an odd race which, with its nearly 2,000 \nentries, is the busiest race, if not of the world, at least of the Mediterranean. \nIt started as a family business with ten classes subdivided by LOA and no handicaps. \nThe plainness of the formula appealed to many competitors, as well as its timing in \nmid-October, the traditional end of the sailing season. The growth in popularity \nattracted the big boats, starting a virtuous circle that eventually led to the present \nastounding numbers and the participation of monsters the like of Alfa Romeo and Skandia.</p>\n<p>The starting line is a 2 NM affair, with intermediate buoys, several powerboats and \na helicopter running along and back to help keep the alignment. It is impossible, of \ncourse, to set the first mark against the wind, so it may happen that all the 2,000 \nboats (well, almost all), decide to start on the port tack. This was the case this \nyear, with a strong northeasterly Bora blowing straight down the hills with gusts \nin the order of 30 knots.</p>\n<p>After the start, a 5-mile run downwind, just to attend the rendezvous of the \nfirst mark. You feel like a tuna swimming to the chamber-of-death through a labyrinth \nof nets. There is nothing left to your choice anymore, apart from keeping as far as\n possible from the other boats. And this is usually the moment when our 10 ft Douglas-fir \n bowsprit inspires the most reverential looks of awe! Once the first mark is left astern,\n  the fleet disperses and you generally end up by racing your private competition against\n   the boats nearby.</p>\n<p>The observance of the rules of the road is of the utmost importance. But the rules \nalone are not enough, and you know you are going to take risks. Since the space\n for evolutions is so small, the understanding between skippers is essential. Some \n unorthodox manoeuvres are often the most effective \u2013 if they fail, catastrophe can be \n quite close.</p>\n<p>We approached the verge of disaster when a small cruiser on the starboard tack boldly\nchanged course as if she meant to pass astern of us \u2013 giving way to the bigger vessel \nis common practice in this race. After a while, however, she headed up again toward us.\nWe lost precious moments when \u2018Moya\u2019 did not answer to the helm hardly pressed windward:\nthe sheet had jammed and for few long seconds we were unable to ease the main. We \nbore away in the end, but our faces turned grey when we missed her stern by only a\nfew inches \u2013 all of us aboard were thinking at the effect of a collision between an\n18-ton gaffer sailing at 7 knots and a small GRP family cruiser!</p>\n<p>So, what is the point of taking part to such an over-crammed event, irrelevant in \ncompetitive terms and potentially dangerous?</p>\n<p>Maybe it is the astonishing participation of the community, a collective urge to \ntake part in a unique meeting, that for a weekend makes Trieste again the Mediterranean \ncapital of sail.</p>\n<p>Maybe it is the rare chance of testing the behaviour of such different crafts \nracing against each other.</p>\n<p>Maybe it is the pride of sailing our superb gaffer and the complacency for the\n compliments paid to her beauty. The owner, a well-mannered person, usually smiles\n  politely in acknowledgement. But when the skipper of a Bavaria told him how nice she \n  was he could not help replying what we all were secretly thinking: \u201cSorry mate, \n  no matter how I try, but cannot honestly say the same.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In late September, 2017, Piero Tassinari died of a brain tumour; he knew that he was \nill, yet his death was unexpected.</p>\n<h4>from 'Severn Tidings', newsletter of the Bristol Channel OGA</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Piero loved the sea, be it the Aegean or the Bristol Channel, and was a member \nof the OGA for ten years or more. He owned the 1910 Morecambe Bay Prawner Moya\nwhich he kept in Turkey. In the summer 2017, he brought <em>Moya</em> across the Aegean \nSea to Greece on a project to trace the Greek myth of Europe on her journey from \nAsia. Amongst his crew were a journalist and a professional cameraman.</p>\n<p>A sixty-minute documentary film was made of the voyage. A haunting and beautiful \nfilm that combines dialogues with Piero, demonstrating his deep knowledge of Ancient\nHistory, with encounters of the people he met ashore as he searched for the answer \nto the simple question of \u2018what is Europe?\u2019. All this set against beautiful imagery of \n<em>Moya</em> and the passing sea and landscapes. This quest, so symptomatic of the man, \nturned out to be his own last voyage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<iframe class=\"rep-video-embed\" src=\"https://video.repubblica.it/embed/super-8/super-8-il-viaggio-di-rumiz-nel-mare-egeo-alla-ricerca-di-europa/283548/284161&width=640&height=360\"\nwidth=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<p>\"</p>", "generic_type": ["Yacht", "Lancashire Nobby"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.5052, "draft": 1.9812, "length_on_deck": 12.954, "length_on_waterline": 10.66812972445745, "length_over_all": 12.954157522555473}, "home_country": "GRE", "home_port": "Aegina", "id": "36519441-55c6-442f-83f3-aa5d691e788c", "image_key": "B73TbG", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Moya", "oga_no": 2334, "ownerships": [{"name": "Chris Waddington", "share": 64, "start": 1958}, {"end": 2017, "name": "Piero Tassinari", "share": 64, "start": 1988}], "place_built": "Arnside", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Built by William Crossfield, Arnside in 1910, <em>Moya</em> is a 43ft Nobby yacht, based in the Mediterranean.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wz6jDgc/0/Th/i-wz6jDgc-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1910, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2334"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
