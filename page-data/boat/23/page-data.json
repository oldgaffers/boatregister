He raced her very successfully. he also made money by taking gentry out for sails and fishing trips. Frank sold her in 1936. The next owner fitted an engine, then she went to the Sea Cadets in Penzance. She was damaged during the second world war against a stone quay wall. After the war she was converted to a yacht with an ugly cabin top. She was taken down through the French canals and eventually made her way to Malta where the Carrs found her. She was virtually derelict but they got her sailing again. They sold the engine to a Maltese fisherman. They sailed for the Caribbean arriving in Grenada. Then followed the Panama Canal and the Pacific. As they went they got jobs where they could. They arrived in New Zealand, Australia, Mauritius, South Africa, Brazil followed on the way back to the Caribbean. Eventually they ended up in South Georgia where they lived for 5 years. There is much more information in their book Antarctic Oasis.","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":1.8806,"generic_type":"Falmouth Quay Punt","handicap_data":{"beam":2.7950499878078516,"draft":1.8806388685686417,"length_over_all":8.53450377956596,"length_on_waterline":8.458302852962692},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.5344,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Curlew is an ex Falmouth Quay Punt.
