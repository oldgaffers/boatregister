The two builders were Tom Barkham and Dick Abernathie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom was the nephew of Alexander Gostelow, from Boston, Lincs, who was a well known Smack and yacht builder, Tom started working in the Boston yard in 1924, and worked on almost all of the Smack yachts, PRIVATEER,ELEANOR, RADIANCE, STORMALONG, WHITE FOAM, SALLY BROWN, ROLLING HOME , just to name afew, just before the start of the second world war, the Gostelow yard closed.TOM was sent to Grimsby to work on the minesweepers for the firm HUMPHERY AND SMITH. IT was here he met with Dick Abernathie, and after the war they started working together, doing repairs on small boats and yachts. Tom was asked by a old customer from his Gostelow days to build a small yacht.The designer was S W Belchambers, and the owner was Bert Bellamy. In 1952 Tom and Dick went there separate ways, and Tom finnished his career working on the restoration of H M S VICTORY, TOM died in 1980, 6 years after retiring,&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have origanal photos of SYBELLA being built, and on the day of her launching, In 2001 i privatley published a book Gaff Rigged out of Boston, which covers all the boats built by Gostelow and details about what TOM did and photos of SYBELLA. IT was during my research that i found the owner of SYBELLA&nbsp;and pestered him for many years to sell which he did &nbsp;to me in 2008, sadley by this time she needed quite abit of work, but in her day(see black and white photo) she looked stunning, also this was TOM,s favourite boat he ever built and also his last, from day one i was helped and encouraged by Toms brother and his cousin to try and find all the boats which where built in the Boston yard, i was pleased to be able to do that as when the book was published Bill and Phillip soon &nbsp;died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would love someone to take this project on, and see her return to grimsby under sail, thanks for reading this S R WRIGHT</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.1336, "draft": 1.143, "length_on_deck": 6.7056, "length_overall": 6.7056}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Norfolk", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "a4f994e1-5e21-415c-a95a-e0a87e6570dc", "image_key": "GBH8rn", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Sybella", "oga_no": 3375, "ownerships": [{"name": "S Wright", "share": 64, "start": 2008}], "place_built": "Grimsby", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Built in 1951, &#39;Sybella&#39; was placed on the market as a restoration project in 2018.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-tfCtNMN/0/Th/i-tfCtNMN-Th.jpg", "uk_part1": "184433", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1951, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3375"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
