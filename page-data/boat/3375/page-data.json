The two builders were Tom Barkham and Dick Abernathie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom was the nephew of Alexander Gostelow, from Boston, Lincs, who was a well known Smack and yacht builder, Tom started working in the Boston yard in 1924, and worked on almost all of the Smack yachts, PRIVATEER,ELEANOR, RADIANCE, STORMALONG, WHITE FOAM, SALLY BROWN, ROLLING HOME , just to name afew, just before the start of the second world war, the Gostelow yard closed.TOM was sent to Grimsby to work on the minesweepers for the firm HUMPHERY AND SMITH.
