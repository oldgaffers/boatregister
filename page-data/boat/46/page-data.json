Only the smack &#39;Gracie&#39; was about when Arthur fired his starting gun (live amo too!) &#39;Seahorse&#39; was ten minutes late, and the association secretary chose to ground in Tollesbury leavings. The race was fraught with light airs, involving much tactical kedging. &#39;Chittabob IV&#39; was first round, as expected, having taken nearly ten hours to do the 35 mile course, but on handicap &#39;Gracie&#39; took the winner&#39;s spot, being only 15 minutes astern of the ECOD.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to be in the 1970s, showing &#39;Gracie&#39; taking part in the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend to Billingsgate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOJDR2zziL0\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>","image_key":"5pKzpc","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-9J9Khhz/0/Th/i-9J9Khhz-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel Larch on oak","draft":1.2954,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"main":{"foot":7.620092660326749,"head":5.18166300902219,"luff":5.4864667154352595},"thcf":1.041,"draft":1.2954157522555474,"sailarea":73.85735982299205,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":10.972933430870519,"fore_triangle_base":7.620092660326749,"length_on_waterline":9.1441111923921,"fore_triangle_height":8.83930748597903},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.9728,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;Gracie&#39; spent her first 20 years off Clacton Beach, and was registered in 1910 to fish CK81.
