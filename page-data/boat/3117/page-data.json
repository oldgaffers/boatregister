Fitted with an engine around 1939 &#39;Phyllis&#39; worked within the company until sold in 1976, when she was taken up to Inverness by new owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was used for the storage and transhipment of bombs from American ships in the Humber during the latter part of WW2. This amongst other cargo is documented in the captain&#39;s diary of 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Largly left in disrepair in Scotland, &#39;Phyllis&#39; was taken on by more new owners and intended to be used as a second vessel in sea battle enactments on Loch Ness. This did not however come to be. Chartered to the Loch Ness Project in 1982/3 &#39;Phyllis&#39; was fitted with sonar and was employed in scanning the depths of the Loch for both geological and marine life investigations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1986 &#39;Phyllis&#39; was in new ownership and not being tended to very often and she eventually sank creating a hazard. Raised and again put up for sale by the local marina &#39;Phyllis&#39; came into the hands of Alan Gardiner and was brought back down to the Humber for restoration which began on a bare and rusting hull in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major repairs to her structure, an enlarged engine room and a steel top to her hold area were amongst the works carried out. New sail handling rollers and all the ironwork for the rig was built by hand and copied from photgraphic records held by the Humber Keel and Sloop Preservation Society. Re-rigged as a sea going Humber sloop (she was formerly a river sloop) from the turn of the 20th century &#39;Phyllis&#39; was back in sail for her centenary in 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pida-O2J0No?rel=0\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>","image_key":"KHmn8h","uk_part1":"124785","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"iron","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"Rivited steel plate.
