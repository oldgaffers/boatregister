The OGA Sailing Committee Chair,\nGeorge Ventris, prefaced the original article by saying: \"We get the feel of the\nold boat's workaday life, yet the humdrum has become a notable romantic gesture\nto keep alive something from what is now a very different time. And since that\nsomething may have more significance for the future than the enthusiasms of the\nhobbyist, we should all be grateful.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There several Telegraphs in the past; a 75 ft. Grimsby (lost 1882) two Brightlingsea/Colne smacks (the first lost 1873 and the second 1924), a Leigh Bawley, a Thames Barge and two or three steamships. The sole surviving \u2018Telegraph\u2019 was known by the older fishermen as the \u2018Boston Telegraph\u2019, to differentiate her from the others.</p>\n<p>She was built for Boston fish merchant William Stringer's fleet from the insurance monies of earlier smack, the \u2018Jane and Eliza\u2019 (BN33) whelker, that was run down whilst at anchor in Boston Deeps by a steamship. William advised the Register that she had \u201cbecome wreck, owing to the extensive damage done to her\" advice received November 1905 from the owner as the Register notes. William Stringer received \u00a3120 from the insurance company to pay for a new vessel, so \u2018Telegraph\u2019 was down around December 1905. She was first registered 23rd May 1906, being launched a few weeks later.</p>\n<p>The mast and sails from the wreck of \u2018Jane and Eliza\u2019 were transferred to \u2018Telegraph and after being fitted with a copper at the aft end of the fish hold she went prawning. \u2018Telegraph\u2019 was entered for many local regattas and a photograph of 1908 shows her anchored at Frieston Shore waiting for water up to Boston. The photograph is captioned \"Mr William Stringer's Telegraph, winner of the Regatta. 23rd September 1908\u201d. William Stringer\u2019s pride was somewhat tempered by her return a week later than expected from the Regatta. The crew had, with the \u00a35 prize money, attempted to drink the Skegness pubs dry. They did however return with a silver cup which was still in the family's possession a few years ago. \u2018Telegraph\u2019 and her near sister \u2018Majestic\u2019 were \"noted Regatta winners\" for several years in local events. Sadly \u2018Majestic\u2019 became a houseboat on the Thames and was broken up around 1979.</p>\n<p>In 1917 William Stringer was impatiently pacing the deck of his new Gostelow built smack \u2018Drummer Boy\u2019, waiting for the tide to flood enough for her to be launched - Gostelow launched all his larger smacks sideways from his yard at the end of Pulvertoft Lane - but for some reason \u2018Drummer Boy\u2019 slid down the ways early and William Stringer was thrown off at the bottom and killed. The ownership of \u2018Telegraph\u2019 passed to his widow Alice on 10th July 1917.</p>\n<p>\u2019Telegraph\u2019 fished uneventfully under sail until an auxiliary engine, a 14hp petrol paraffin Kelvin, was added 1st November 1924. The topmast was laid ashore, the crew reduced from 4 to 3 and the copper moved to the fore end of the fish hold, as burns in the deck beams still testify.</p>\n<p>By the outbreak of World War II, \u2018Telegraph\u2019 was becoming tired and was laid up at Boston 2nd July 1945, the ownership having passed to William Stringer's son William Frederick (Eric) on 13th December 1944. Eric had been serving on Atlantic convoys and had been torpedoed twice, the second time spending 14 hours in the water before being rescued. In 1923. the Stringers had purchased the Norfolk (Kings Lynn) built \u2018George and Charles\u2019 and renamed her \u2018Freda and Nora\u2019 after Eric's two sisters, a name that she carries to this day. \u2018Telegraph\u2019 and \u2018Freda and Nora\u2019 both went to Norfolk's yard in 1946 to be rebuilt, Eric expecting \u2018Freda and Nora\u2019 to last him 25 years and \u2018Telegraph\u2019 longer. Telegraph's rebuild took from 1946 to 1948 and cost \u00a34600: \u2018Freda and Nora\u2019 \u00a32500.</p>\n<p>\u2019Telegraph\u2019 was entirely redecked using nearly 3000 ft. run of 4\" x 2\u201d Oregon pine on new 8\" x 5\" oak deck beams, all new oak covering boards and stanchions and nearly every top section of frame was replaced to the first futtock, being scarphed then strapped with wrought iron futtock pieces through bolted. These may have been as original or due to timber shortages just after the War.</p>\n<p>The hull planking was made good and then doubled over using 1\u201d wytch elm, making a total planking thickness of 21\" thick. New rails, rail cappings and hatches completed the deck layout as per original, and a short derrick mast and boom were fitted, being reputedly her old mainmast cut down. One intriguing remark made by Eric Stringer was to the effect that \u2018Telegraph\u2019 \u201chad a double stem\u201d and so she did. Due to her bow being so fine. when Norfolk\u2019s doubled her the extra thickness of planking ran right past the existing stem, so they were forced to plant another wider stem on the forward side of the original existing one, the old stem effectively becoming an outer apron. So there is now 3 ft. of solid timber in this area.</p>\n<p>The fitting of a 'K type 44 hp Kelvin diesel' completed the refit and \u2018Telegraph\u2019 went back to work as a fully powered motor vessel beam trawling for prawns still retaining the copper in the forward end of the fish hold. Olsen's Almanack for 1958 shows \u2018Telegraph\u2019 as a motor vessel with auxiliary sail, so presumably she had retained some vestige of canvas even then, but by 1961 no canvas was carried at all, as photographs show. Disaster befell early in 1969 on a fine clear day, \u2018Drummer Boy\u2019 was towing her gear in The Wash when \u2018Telegraph\u2019 collided with her. \u2018Drummer Boy\u2019 sank within 2 minutes, fortunately with no loss of life, the crew scrambling on board \u2018Telegraph\u2019 as \u2018Drummer Boy\u2019 sank.</p>\n<p>In a seemingly bizarre way, \u2018Telegraph\u2019 appeared to have avenged the death of her owner some 52 years earlier. \u2018Telegraph\u2019 was held entirely to blame for the accident and Eric Stringer, being under insured, lost \u2018Telegraph\u2019, \u2018Freda and Nora\u2019 and \u2018Arlanza\u2019, a cockle boat. \u2018Telegraph\u2019 was sold for \u00a3400 to Raymond Maltby and Raymond Sargent of Boston on 7th February 1969, and for a profit, to John Marshall on 31st March 1969. John Marshall kept her for a few months then sold her to J &amp; B D Elington of Kings Lynn, \u2018Telegraph\u2019 being re-registered LN122, a neat move that only entailed painting out the back of the 'B' in the Portmark.</p>\n<p>In Kings Lynn the original anchor winch was removed and an offset wheelhouse built to starboard, the boiler removed and 'A' frames added so \u2018Telegraph\u2019 could now go fishing with an otter trawl. She continued in this guise until finally being decommissioned and the registry cancelled, 4th December 1975.</p>\n<p>\u2019Telegraph\u2019 lay semi-derelict in Fisher Fleet until Roger Warr of Feltham found her and had her towed first to Wells-next-the-Sea, then to Harwich and finally to Woodbridge. Robert Simper recorded in \u2018Sea Breezes\u2019 that she had been sold for restoration. \u2018Telegraph\u2019 lay off Whipstocks yard half sinking until they hauled her out and Roger Warr completely stripped the hull of all fittings, removing the AEC diesel, then all the rails and cappings, most of the stern, 50% of the deck and hatches, every vestige of internal accommodation and fittings and finally the stem, whereupon he gave up. \u2018Telegraph\u2019 then languished ashore for about 2 years and Whisstocks were desperate to rid themselves of this eyesore. They had considered skinning her in polythene and dumping her down river and had even offered her to the American Air Force as a bombing target in Wainfleet Haven - the Americans replying \"Sure, you get it there, we'll bomb it.\u201d</p>\n<p>In August 1979, shipwright Colin Swindale found her, green, with caulking hanging out in great loops. He was immediately attracted to both her powerful shape and her fine underwater lines, despite her woeful condition. When he learnt that the yard had quoted the owner \u00a32,500 to break her up and that this would happen by September, he decided to 'stick his neck out' and save her, as nobody else was going to do anything positive.</p>\n<p>He purchased the hulk from the yard for \u00a31 \"and other considerations\", namely that she was removed from the yard, one way or another, either as firewood or as a boat, within six weeks, and that she left the Deben River never to return, the yard being so terrified of any potential liability. Despite Eric Stringer's warnings to him about \u2018Telegraph\u2019 \"bringing him trouble\", Colin worked 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, totally renailing, recaulking and stopping the hull, and 6 weeks and 1 day later \u2018Telegraph\u2019 was relaunched. Much to everyone\u2019s amazement, including Colin's, she did not leak or even weep when she regained the water. Colin spent the next month making \u2018Telegraph\u2019 fit to tow to Tollesbury, Essex, where he lived and in late October 1979, she arrived for the start of a four year rebuild.</p>\n<p>Colin had earlier rebuilt a 56 ft. teak ex-steam yacht and from the sale of this he funded most of the restoration back to original sailing condition. The rebuild entailed a complete new stern including the sternpost, rudder trunking, rudder and replanking the port quarter; and forward a new oak 8\" x 5\" stem and outer apron. On deck, 800ft run of 4\" x 2\" Oregon pine was laid in the chain sawn holes, two new deck beams, 16 oak bulwark stanchions, new bulwarks and new port and starboard bitt heads. Also, a totally rebuilt original windlass, found in a ditch in the back of a semi-derelict boatyard in Boston, possibly from the \u2018Pam\u2019. All new metal deck and hull fittings were in the style of the original, the style and shape being gleaned from old photographs and the study of three wrecks at Heacham, Norfolk, where they had lain since the 1920s. A complete set of sails, spars, standing and running rigging were also required, the sail plan being designed using Jane and Eliza's photograph as the definitive article, the mainsail alone being 1200 sq ft, the normal working bowsprit jib being 50ft in the hoist and 500 sq ft area, the total working sail area being around 2400 sq ft. Colin had purchased a new 50hp diesel for her, but this was never fitted and \u2018Telegraph\u2019 still sails without an engine today.</p>\n<p>The first sail, and her first under pure sail for 64 years, was in September 1983. Whilst \u2018Telegraph\u2019 performed quite well it became apparent that all her sailing ballast must have been removed during the 1946 rebuild and a concrete skim of 2 or 3 tons only put in the bilge to keep her clean. Colin purchased 13 tons of pig iron, which was installed in the next few days throughout the bilge, about 3 or 4 tons finishing up as a small mountain in the middle of the fish hold.</p>\n<p>The following year, Colin added a topmast and \u2018Telegraph\u2019 took part in several events, including the Colne Match that year. In \"Yachts &amp; Yachting\" Robert Simper wrote \"A squall hit some of \u2018the fleet off the Mersea shore and Telegraph\u2019 was laid right down\" and so she was, with the starboard spreader end ploughing a furrow through the waves. Amazingly, she did not stop but just kept ploughing along on her side. I suppose 38 tons took a lot of stopping. One of the crew remarked afterwards how the mainsail had formed itself to the shape of the wave pattern.</p>\n<p>Colin reluctantly had to part with \u2018Telegraph\u2019 in 1986 and she finished up lying derelict at Heybridge Basin for 9 years. All her spars were ashore, rotting in the nettles, all the bulwarks and rails had been torn off, and some of the hatches and covering boards, leaving her open to the weather. Some of her former crew found her, half sunk, and were horrified at her condition and how she had deteriorated in a few years. Eventually she was towed to Maldon by \u2018Ostrea Rose\u2019 and a second restoration commenced. This consisted of all new covering boards, bulwarks and rail cappings, plus 14 new stanchions forward, a new hollow 37 ft spruce boom and running rigging.</p>\n<p>Sailing again in 1995, visiting Shotley Classic Boat Festival and being featured in \u201cClassic Boat\" magazine, in all she was underway 32 times that year and in 1996 a new topsail of some 600ft was added to the sail wardrobe. It is hoped that in the future \u2018Telegraph\u2019 will have many a full season of events and festivals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>by Colin Swindale</h4>\n<p>First published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter 1997 Sept. and Nov.</p>", "generic_type": "Boston Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 4.267, "draft": 1.372, "length_on_deck": 16.154, "length_on_waterline": 14.935, "length_over_all": 16.155}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Maldon", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "5f03e7fb-5dca-43fc-bd9b-81abee801fbd", "image_key": "pZgQ6n", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Telegraph", "oga_no": 1662, "ownerships": [{"end": 1986, "name": "Colin Swindale", "share": 64, "start": 1979}], "place_built": "Boston", "reference": ["Log Sep 97", "Log Nov 97"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Built in 1906 for William Stringer of Boston, funded by insurance money, when\nthe\u00a0<em>Jane and Eliza</em> was run down by a steamship whilst at anchor in the Boston\nDeeps.\u00a0<em>Telegraph</em> has undergone at least three major restorations since the\n1940s.</p>", "updated_at": "2024-10-17", "year": 1906, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/1662"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
