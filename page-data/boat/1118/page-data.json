This article was first published in 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>lt started with a commission to design a barge yacht in ferro-cement, in 1963. I managed to persuade the owner to build in steel (being much better for sitting on rocks, old engines and the like for one thing) and in the end, via many trial designs, we went for a very fine-lined vessel which has sailed extensively since she was built in 1970. She is &lsquo;Halfway&rsquo;, sprit rigged much against my wishes. From the beginning I accepted certain challenges and was determined to overcome the traditional and undisputed potential faults of the flat-bottomed vessel. I feel that we have succeeded, certainly with regard to the important ones like range of stability and freedom from pounding.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A recent discussion with the owner of &lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo;, undoubtedly one of the best of the traditional barge yachts, showed up the strengths and weaknesses of the marque. Compared with &lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo;, and her near sister &lsquo;Dione&rsquo;, we have far better accommodation with good standing headroom even in our smaller version (27&rsquo; as opposed to their 30&rsquo;). All sail well when you know how to get the best out of them. We don&#39;t pound whereas they do somewhat, though less than you might expect.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>All these barge yachts (&lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo;, &lsquo;Dione&rsquo;, our E27 and E33 classes) are somewhat heavy (ours are very heavy) and this affects handling techniques. You need to keep the craft moving, but at least with ours you will not get caught in stays in the traditional sense. We don&#39;t back any headsail when tacking. You can however get stuck on the new tack if you allow her to lose steerage way (and this is more likely in a chop), and to get going again the distribution of sails is important.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I understand that the two earlier barges mentioned, like ours, cannot sail under mainsail only, and they need the jib rather than the foresail to balance the main, if not both (all these craft are cutter rigged). With the proper sail combinations however &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; (and I think the others - certainly ours) will handle like a dinghy in light winds, and balance very well under reefed main and jib or foresail. &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; also sails well under foresail only (but she won&#39;t usually tack), or under headsails and mizzen (when she will tack positively, and this is very useful single-handed)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Some sailing techniques do carry over from the full-size barges, particularly the need for full sails and sailing full. Baggy sails can let one surprisingly close to the wind as more up-to-date racing helmsmen know. Sunlight&#39;s sails are in fact too flat, the mainsail much too much so. The main is roller reefed, so needs to be laced, but we expect better results from a loose-footed mainsail currently on order for another boat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I am told that full-size barges will not heave-to. This is probably due to the rig rather than the hulls and boomy barges may have done this perfectly well. Our barge yachts (and I understand &lsquo;Nancy Grey&rsquo; also) heave-to well and we do this many times every trip when short-handed to raise or lower sails. On &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; the wheel is hydraulic and self-locking, which is a great boon for the helmsman who can leave the helm to attend to leeboards and assist with headsails if necessary.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The barge yachts sail themselves well on many points of sailing and this also enables the helmsman to go forward or into the cabin to attend to other matters. When tacking, both boards can be left down if preferred. We have not ascertained what loss of speed results, but there is certainly no structural problem, the windward board floating out as far as necessary. Our leeboards are unusual in that they tuck within the overall beam of the vessel - which has flared sides - when housed. In future we will be fitting rubber blocks to fender the housed boards and this will reduce the tapping noise they produce when the vessel rolls with the boards raised. Otherwise we stuff in fenders.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; has a lovely easy rolling motion at sea - no gimballed cooker required, and things put down generally stay put. This includes an unsecured coal hod in one vessel. On the wind we generally sail at a steady 15 degrees in a breeze. Maximum yet recorded is 25 degrees in an OGA race. The general feel is that of a keelboat, and the range of stability (typically 1-17 degrees) is similar to keel boats, better than most traditional craft, keels or otherwise.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We have not sailed &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; so long nor so far as we would wish. Extreme pressure of work-limits our sailing to the Thames Estuary with quick sorties across to Essex and Suffolk. Our dream this year is to get away long enough to join the OGA cruise in company to Holland. Our aspirations go much further, however, and if we had the opportunity we would be sailing &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; to Brittany via Norway and maybe Finland, looking at inland seas and enjoying drying harbours on the way, then maybe to continue through the canals and rivers to the Mediterranean, coming back &lsquo;outside&rsquo;. That is the sort of cruising for which &lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; was designed and built.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Sunlight&rsquo; is the first of the &lsquo;Eastcountryman 33&rsquo; class. Her dimensions are 49&rsquo; overall, 33&rsquo; length on deck, very nearly this on the waterline, beam 11&rsquo;, draft 2&#39; 6&quot; boards up, headroom generally 6&#39; 10&quot; (just under 6&rsquo; in the aft cabin), displacement 13 tons, engine BUKH 36 bhp diesel, 7 knots on full power (which we have never needed yet), fuel 80 gallons, water 250 gallons. The layout below decks will have a total of seven berths (or rather berths for seven persons since two are double) including an occasional berth in the forepeak, and excluding the settee in the saloon which could accommodate a small person or child. However the layout is intended to accommodate say four in domestic comfort with the saloon purely for eating and relaxing - with lots of room for that, and for eating your own dinner and not that of your neighbour - and with the quarter berths in the galley/chart room regarded as the only two sea berths. The aft cabin has a separate WC and shower and is self-contained.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A coal stove will operate central heating throughout the boat, and a pressure system will supply both heads and the galley and showers with hot and cold water from the ample tankage available. An unusual feature is a skin cooling tank for the engine to facilitate operation in muddy waters (and indeed in mud), and she also has a weedhatch giving access to the propeller from the aft cabin in the event of picking up debris on the screw, which we have already needed to use four times. Construction is steel, 10mm bottom, 6mm side and lesser thicknesses higher up with a laminated ply cabin top to give a very low centre of gravity. She has timber bulwarks with carved decorative badges, and a vessel we are building now has the owners&#39; motif on each bow, which will be very pretty.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We are interested in building other traditional types and we have discussed yacht Mersey Flats and yacht wherries with clients, as well as Scandinavian type double-enders. And (can I say it in this magazine?) modern Bermudan rigged shoal draft steel craft. Back to the &lsquo;Eastcountryman&#39;, we can build up to nearly 60&rsquo; under cover and are currently discussing a cargo carrying version, which would be a nice turn to the wheel of fortune (or if not fortune, keep us busy!)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>by Paul Winch<br />\r\nFirst published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter, 1984/4</h4>","image_key":"JFx4MF","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Ketch","construction_material":"steel","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":0.762,"generic_type":"Barge","handicap_data":{"beam":3.4138015118263834,"draft":0.7620092660326749,"length_over_all":10.05852231163131,"length_on_waterline":10.05852231163131},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.0584,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;Sunlight&#39; was the first of the &#39;Eastcountryman 33&#39; class, built by Paul Winch in 1980 prior to forming his company in the same name.</p>","updated_at":"2021-03-27T22:53:24.655634+00:00","website":"","beam":3.4138,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"fc20882a-afef-4027-8ffd-38b8c888437d","designer":"18430ed0-dc84-4565-bfa9-e9822ff94246","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"steel"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Paul Winch"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Ketch"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Barge"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Paul Winch"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
