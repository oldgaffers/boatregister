The\ndesigner and builder are currently unknown, but historic surveys state the hull\nwas built in Ghana then shipped to Germany for fitting out, completed c.1963.\nHull construction is exactly to Lloyds A1 standard for wood construction\nfastened with copper, and was built to exacting tolerances with very fine seams\nand seam savers on the inside seams (rebated into the iroko frames). The\ncentreboard runs most of the length of the keel, and is an iroko blade with a\nstainless steel internal cover. The centreboard is raised an lowered by hand\nwinch from the cockpit. Draft with centreboard down increases to 8 feet. The\ninterior reflects the high standards of finish and attention to detail prevalent\nin German yards of the period. She has undergone several refits and\nrefurbishments, including having the original engine replaced with a Bukh 36,\nwhich now occupies what would have been a small stern cabin, replacement of the\nteak deck in the 2000s, some hull replanking and main mast rebuilding in 2022.\nCurrently in the final phases of renewing brightwork and detail repairs.</p>", "generic_type": "Racing Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.399, "draft": 1.402, "length_on_deck": 3.472}, "home_country": "UK", "home_port": "Woodbridge", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "image_key": "LBgLS2", "mainsail_type": "bermudan", "name": "Tannhauser", "oga_no": 3561, "place_built": "Hull built in Ghana, fitted out in Germany", "previous_names": ["Dr Dolittle", "Stormvogel"], "rig_type": "Ketch", "short_description": "<p>German 1950s design racing cruiser built in the early 1960s</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "ssr": "SSR170561", "year": 1963, "year_is_approximate": true}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3561"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
