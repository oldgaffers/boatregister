Six were built in 1912 with a further Four in 1914. Five Rivers Class yachts are thought to be still in existence: Arnside Sailing Club’s “Severn” 'Deva', 'Dart', 'Styx' (all on the OGA Register) and 'Esk'.</p><p>“Clwyd” which was originally called “Keer” was built in 1914. The River Keer rises on Docker Moor, west of Kirkby Lonsdale and enters the sea at Carnforth north of Morecambe. For part of its course, it forms the boundary between Cumbria and Lancashire. The first owner G.F.Law must have had some connection with the Carnforth area to name his boat after the River Keer.</p><p>The River Class were used largely for evening racing with a season running from May to July, with regatta race in July. The boats were also raced in August at the Straits Regatta on Anglesey. They were raced for prize money. In 1914 prize money was £44 when the average wage was £67. The Royal Mersey Yacht Club was based in Rock Ferry, a then prosperous area of Birkenhead with large houses overlooking the river. Under G.F.Law’s ownership Keer won one race in 1914, two in 1921 and one in 1922.</p><p>The design was based upon the Blackpool and Fleetwood Jewel Class. The boats were originally opened decked. They had a crew of three. The boats cost £50 each delivered afloat with a further £14.18s for the sails. (In total £4000 in 2021 prices, labour was a lot cheaper then).</p><p>In 1923 “Keer” was acquired by Charles Livingston, the Vice Commodore of the Royal Mersey Club. Charles was related to the founders of the Cunard and MacIver Lines. He was the first owner of Mersey also included in the OGA Boat Register. “Keer” was renamed “Ogwen”. The River Ogwen’s or more correctly Afon Ogwen’s source is Llyn Ogwen in Snowdonia under the shadow of Tryfan. The River Ogwen enter the sea south of Bangor.</p><p>In 1924 “Ogwen” was brought for £104 15s 5d (£6500 in 2021 prices) by William Phythian Davidson, the Secretary and Treasurer of Club, an unmarried accountant who ran the Royal Mersey from 1908 till his death in 1939. William already owned another Rivers Class boat also built in 1914 called “Clwyd” but generally known as the red boat. William renamed “Ogwen” “Clwyd” repainting her red and swapping the sails over. William sold his old boat to the Earl of Derby. The River Clwyd is a river in North Wales that comes out at Rhyl.</p><p>After 1926 “Clwyd” was only raced in the Rivers Class series in 1935.</p><p>“Clwyd” spent the Second World War hauled out in a field near Bootle. She was owned by Ken Colley who fitted a cabin. His first cruise in her was to the Menai Straits with four adults sharing the cabin, which must have been a tight fit. She seems to have been kept after the war on the River Alt at Hightown between Liverpool and Southport. Arnside Sailing Club’s Severn may have been there at the same time.</p><p>By the 1960s “Clwyd” was on the Humber. She was advertised for sale in the Gaffers Log in 1968 by P.Austin of Cottingham near Hull for £350 (£6000 in 2021 prices). By this time, she had been restored to her open deck appearance with her cabin removed, though the advert mentioned that two people could sleep under her foredeck if required.</p><p>Clwyd was damaged in 1970s whilst in Hull Docks by a barge that have come lose from her moorings.</p><p>One of her owners described her as “A great sail – sailed like a witch”</p>","image_key":null,"thumb":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel built with counter stern.
