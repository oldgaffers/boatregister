The deck was most likely originally open, with a large cockpit. Future kings of Great Britain, Edward VIII and George VI as well as Prince George, Duke of Kent were all cadets at Osborne during this period and probably trained on Star. In 1921, the College was moved to Dartmouth. Star remained on the RN register until 1925 but was sold locally on the IoW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925 she entered Lloyd&#39;s Register of Yachts as owned by&nbsp;Mr. Martin H. Ellis. She is believed to have had a small refit back at Wade&rsquo;s. She was to stay on the island until 1939 when she was sold to Mr. F. Stanley Lewis of Fambridge. The Essex rivers clearly agreed with her and at various times she was kept at Tollesbury, Maldon and West Mersea. She had a major refit in 1955 at William King&rsquo;s yard in Burnham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Margaret &lsquo;Pat&rsquo; Miller of Tollesbury bought her in 1957 and raced her in the first East Coast Old Gaffers race in 1963. She is described in the race notes as a 26&#39; cutter, with white and red sails, and white topsides, flying a green flag with a white star. Of the 30 boats that started the race only 7 completed the course, and Star was one of the ones that retired. Far from being put off by the experience, the same owner raced her every year up to 1969, winning the Cup for Trying in 1968. The Cup for Trying was awarded annually to the boat with the best aggregate performance in the current and previous races and not winning a prize in any of the races.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L.A Vincent of Tolleshunt D&#39;Arcy bought her in 1970-1. He gave her a thorough refit and she continued racing under his ownership until at least 1974. A 1981 survey for the then owner John Thorne describes her as a &#39;well constructed yacht and in a basically sound condition for her age&#39;. Sometime after that she was bought afloat, but leaking, and left ashore, with hope of repairs that never happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1986, she was found by Christopher Fittock who wanted a boat ready to sail, but fell in love with Star, who needed a little more attention. Handy, but inexperienced in boat building, it took him six years to get her afloat. He rebuilt the stern and stem post, replaced the deck, 30% of the planks and 70% of the elm keel. The Stuart Turner engine was replaced with a new Dolphine two stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Re-launched at the Downs Road Boatyard she was meant to be rigged but the owner went to sea on a tall ship, married and moved to Lancashire. Eventually he brought her up to Morecambe Bay but increasing family commitments rendered her sale essential. The last maintenance work in England was made at the David Moss shipyard in Skippool in 2005. Back in the East Coast hands of Colin Francis of Maldon, by October 2006 she was back down at West Mersea and reviewed in Classic Boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Michele Ivaldi bought her in 2007 and brought her to the Costantini brother&rsquo;s yard on Lake Maggiore, Italy, for a long and difficult restoration. She was re-launched on the shores of Lake Maggiore on June 16, 2012 and nominated for the Classic Boat Restoration of the Year (under 40ft, Europe) awards in 2013. With her current owner, Paolo Sivelli, she made a triumphant appearance at the Verbano Classics in 2013, not only winning the prize for the most &#39;technical and historical interest&#39;, but winning Sunday&rsquo;s race on corrected time. For 2014 the rudder and steering will be improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Star is clearly in good hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research by Paulo Sivelli and Julian Cable</h3>","image_key":"84HPKX","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel pine on elm frames, elm keel, new strakes of iroko & agba","draft":1.1948,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.1305779078273592,"main":{"foot":5.5199951231406965,"head":3.7003169958546698,"luff":4.998780785174347},"thcf":0.949416408,"draft":1.210070714459888,"topsail":{"luff":2.801146061936113,"perpendicular":1.6093635698610096},"length_over_all":7.918800292611558,"fore_triangle_base":4.559863447939527,"length_on_waterline":6.059497683491831,"fore_triangle_height":8.54059985369422},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.9004,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Designed and built by the Alfred Wade Yard, Isle of Wight, 1907, Star's first owner was the Royal Naval College.
