It is constructed as a wood epoxy composite of western red cedar strips overlaid with khaya mahogany veneer. The design is by Andrew Wolstenholme and is very forgiving due to a 70 lb galvanised centre plate, a hollow (noble) mast and carbon fibre gaff. I have never managed to capsize it. It is sound and requires nothing but cosmetic work. The control lines are arranged for single handed sailing, including single line reefing. Can be fitted with an outboard motor. The ‘barn door’ rudder means it can be sailed in very shallow water. It comes with a road trailer and separate new galvanised launching trolley.","sold":null,"summary":null,"updated_at":"2021-04-24T12:33:56.88108+00:00"}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
