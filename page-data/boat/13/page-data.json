A few years later Jimmy sold her to the Coghill family who gave it as a wedding present to their son Frank &amp; Jenny (nee Lee). I sailed on her occasionally with Frank &amp; Jenny. She was based at Cardwell Bay Sailing Club in Gourock at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming back to my father&rsquo;s connection, when he first sailed with his friend Andrew Motherwell, he was surprised and delighted to find he already knew the boat. Dad had in fact sailed on her as a young man in the late 1940s when she was owned by his friend Sandy Denny, whose family owned Denny&rsquo;s shipyard in Dumbarton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, &#39;Thistle&#39; was restored by a French boatyard and raced - by Bruno Peyron, no less - on the Mediterranean classic yacht regatta circuit. She was re-named &#39;Lady Trix&#39;, after her original 1909 name of &#39;Trix&#39;. &nbsp;In fact her rudder post, when I sailed on her in the 1970s, still had the name &#39;Trix&#39; engraved into the brass top fitting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems she was hit by a 6 metre and holed badly in a regatta at Antibes. There were magazine reports and photographs of the collision, and I have not heard of her since. The magazine articles of the collision, as well as an article describing the lengthy restoration project, may be found on the internet by googling &ldquo;Lady Trix yacht&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believed she was built for Lady Coats (wife of a scion of the Paisley thread-making dynasty), but there is another story that she was built for the wife of a Glasgow steel magnate who was well known to Alfred Mylne, the designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope this provides a little more colour about this wonderful boat. She handled beautifully and was a joy to sail. She was the first yacht I sailed on and I have very happy memories of sailing and racing her in my early teens with Andrew and my Dad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With warm memories, David Johnston</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.museemaritimelarochelle.fr/contenu/,les_yachts_agrees_sur_nos_quais,101?idbateau=57\" target=\"_blank\">Find an article in French, here, written in 2009</a></p>","image_key":"RPwzFh","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"Pitch pine on steamed rock elm.","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.13362594489149,"draft":1.5240185320653499,"length_over_all":8.686905632772493,"length_on_waterline":5.6388685686417945},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.6868,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;Thistle&#39;, previously known as &#39;Trix&#39; until 1946, was built in Scotland, 1909 to an Alfred Mylne design.
