A few years later Jimmy sold her to the Coghill family who gave it as a wedding present to their son Frank &amp; Jenny (nee Lee). I sailed on her occasionally with Frank &amp; Jenny. She was based at Cardwell Bay Sailing Club in Gourock at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming back to my father&rsquo;s connection, when he first sailed with his friend Andrew Motherwell, he was surprised and delighted to find he already knew the boat. Dad had in fact sailed on her as a young man in the late 1940s when she was owned by his friend Sandy Denny, whose family owned Denny&rsquo;s shipyard in Dumbarton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, &#39;Thistle&#39; was restored by a French boatyard and raced - by Bruno Peyron, no less - on the Mediterranean classic yacht regatta circuit. She was re-named &#39;Lady Trix&#39;, after her original 1909 name of &#39;Trix&#39;. &nbsp;In fact her rudder post, when I sailed on her in the 1970s, still had the name &#39;Trix&#39; engraved into the brass top fitting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems she was hit by a 6 metre and holed badly in a regatta at Antibes. There were magazine reports and photographs of the collision, and I have not heard of her since. The magazine articles of the collision, as well as an article describing the lengthy restoration project, may be found on the internet by googling &ldquo;Lady Trix yacht&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believed she was built for Lady Coats (wife of a scion of the Paisley thread-making dynasty), but there is another story that she was built for the wife of a Glasgow steel magnate who was well known to Alfred Mylne, the designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope this provides a little more colour about this wonderful boat. She handled beautifully and was a joy to sail. She was the first yacht I sailed on and I have very happy memories of sailing and racing her in my early teens with Andrew and my Dad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With warm memories, David Johnston</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.museemaritimelarochelle.fr/contenu/,les_yachts_agrees_sur_nos_quais,101?idbateau=57\" target=\"_blank\">Find an article in French, here, written in 2009</a></p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.1336, "draft": 1.524, "length_on_deck": 8.6868, "length_on_waterline": 5.6388685686417945, "length_over_all": 8.686905632772493}, "home_country": "FRA", "home_port": "la Rochelle", "hull_form": "unknown", "id": "404a9154-7c0f-4952-916f-5995c9f8f519", "image_key": "RPwzFh", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Lady Trix", "oga_no": 13, "ownerships": [{"note": "There are two versions of her first ownership:", "text": "There are two versions of her first ownership:"}, {"end": 1, "note": "1.
