My father was a member of her regular racing crew from about\n1971 to 1975 when *Thistle* was owned by Dr Andrew Motherwell and raced\nfrom Royal Gourock Yacht Club.  When Andrew emigrated to Australia\nhe sold her to Dr Jimmy Buchanan who kept her at Otter Ferry. A few years later\nJimmy sold her to the Coghill family who gave it as a wedding present to their\nson Frank &amp; Jenny (nee Lee). I sailed on her occasionally with Frank &amp;\nJenny. She was based at Cardwell Bay Sailing Club in Gourock at the time.\nComing back to my father's connection, when he first sailed with\nhis friend Andrew Motherwell, he was surprised and delighted to find he already\nknew the boat. Dad had in fact sailed on her as a young man in the late 1940s\nwhen she was owned by his friend Sandy Denny, whose family owned Denny&rsquo;s\nshipyard in Dumbarton.More recently, *Thistle* was restored\nby a French boatyard and raced - by Bruno Peyron, no less - on the Mediterranean\nclassic yacht regatta circuit. She was re-named *Lady Trix*, after her\noriginal 1909 name of *Trix*.  In fact her rudder post, when I sailed\non her in the 1970s, still had the name *Trix* engraved into the brass\ntop fitting. It seems she was hit by a 6 metre and holed badly\nin a regatta at Antibes. There were magazine reports and photographs of the collision,\nand I have not heard of her since. The magazine articles of the collision, as\nwell as an article describing the lengthy restoration project, may be found on\nthe internet by googling &ldquo;Lady Trix yacht&rdquo;.I believed\nshe was built for Lady Coats (wife of a scion of the Paisley thread-making dynasty),\nbut there is another story that she was built for the wife of a Glasgow steel\nmagnate who was well known to Alfred Mylne, the designer.\n\nI hope this provides a little more colour about this wonderful boat. She handled\nbeautifully and was a joy to sail. She was the first yacht I sailed on and I have\nvery happy memories of sailing and racing her in my early teens with Andrew and\nmy Dad.With warm memories, David Johnston\n\n<a href=\"http://www.museemaritimelarochelle.fr/contenu/,les_yachts_agrees_sur_nos_quais,101?idbateau=57\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">Find an article in French, here, written in 2009</a>\n\nThere are two versions of her first ownership:'\n\n1. She was ordered for a Miss C Howden's 18th birthday. This young lady's father appears\n   to be the owner of Howden Engineering, and known to Alfred Mylne.\n   Howdens was a pioneering firm of industrial engineers which exists to this day.\n\n2. The lore around Royal Gourock YC was that she was built for Lady Coats,\n  perhaps biased by the Club's early connections to the Coats family (known\n  for their thread spinning and cloth weaving businesses). It was one of the (several)\n  Coats baronets who had the Clubhouse built in 1894, and donated to the club\n  membership under a Deed of Trust. A member of the same family, Sir Thomas Glen-Coats,\n  distinguished himself by winning the 12 metre gold at the 1908 Olympics. The\n  same fellow was an apprentice yacht designer and assistant to Alfred Mylne.\n  Although there is a certain roundness to this version, that does not necessarily\n  mean it is true!", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.1336, "draft": 1.524, "length_on_deck": 8.6868, "length_on_waterline": 5.6388685686417945, "length_over_all": 8.686905632772493}, "home_country": "FRA", "home_port": "la Rochelle", "image_key": "RPwzFh", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Lady Trix", "oga_no": 13, "ownerships": [{"name": "Miss C Howden", "start": 1909}, {"end": 1978, "name": "Dr Andrew Motherwell"}, {"name": "J.S.
