The main mast was in the bow, like a catboat except she carried a bowsprit, and a mizzen on the transom. Her hull is very similar to other contemporary fishing boats except for the bow which has more rake and flare which was believed to be at the suggestion of an American sailor working in the yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her first owner was John de la Mare who passed the boat on to his son also called John de la Mare. She won Guernsey regatta races in 1912, 1913 and 1920. Walter Gauvain bought her from John de la Mare Jnr. in 1954 and took her to Alderney where he fished with her under motor to a year before his death.&nbsp; Her top planks were badly smashed when a bigger boat laid on her and he was going to break her up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His grandson, Charles Greenslade decided to take her on and repair the damage and put a cabin and a tripod on for lights intending to use her as a motor fishing boat. In 1970 he decided to return her to sail as a gaff cutter. He has subsequently replaced the cabin top in 1983 and in 1985 he replaced the mast and increased the luff of the mainsail.</p>","image_key":"krwphj","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Pine carvel planking on oak sawn frames","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Smack","handicap_data":{"beam":1.9812240916849548,"main":{"foot":3.3528407705437697,"head":2.7432333577176298,"luff":1.9812240916849548},"thcf":0.775516332,"draft":0.9144111192392099,"topsail":{"luff":2.0330407217751767,"perpendicular":1.3472323823457693},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":4.977444525725432,"fore_triangle_base":2.234211168007803,"length_on_waterline":4.419653742989515,"fore_triangle_height":4.26725188978298},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":4.9774,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Hirondelle was built on Guernsey in 1904.
