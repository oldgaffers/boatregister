The main mast was in the bow, like a catboat except she carried\na bowsprit, and a mizzen on the transom. Her hull is very similar to other contemporary\nfishing boats except for the bow which has more rake and flare which was believed\nto be at the suggestion of an American sailor working in the yard.</p>\n<p>Her first owner was John de la Mare who passed the boat on to his son also called\nJohn de la Mare. She won Guernsey regatta races in 1912, 1913 and 1920. Walter\nGauvain bought her from John de la Mare Jnr. in 1954 and took her to Alderney\nwhere he fished with her under motor to a year before his death. Her top\nplanks were badly smashed when a bigger boat laid on her and he was going to break\nher up.</p>\n<p>His grandson, Charles Greenslade decided to take her on\nand repair the damage and put a cabin and a tripod on for lights intending to\nuse her as a motor fishing boat. In 1970 he decided to return her to sail as a\ngaff cutter. He has subsequently replaced the cabin top in 1983 and in 1985 he\nreplaced the mast and increased the luff of the mainsail.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.9812, "draft": 0.9144, "fore_triangle_base": 2.234211168007803, "fore_triangle_height": 4.26725188978298, "length_on_deck": 4.9774, "length_on_waterline": 4.419653742989515, "length_over_all": 4.977444525725432, "main": {"foot": 3.3528407705437697, "head": 2.7432333577176298, "luff": 1.9812240916849548}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.775516332, "topsail": {"luff": 2.0330407217751767, "perpendicular": 1.3472323823457693}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Braye Harbour Alderney", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "35801a6b-0a03-4e95-8afd-f9ec36d85e79", "image_key": "krwphj", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Hirondelle", "oga_no": 800, "ownerships": [{"name": "John de la Mare", "share": 64, "start": 1904}, {"end": 1967, "name": "Walter Gauvain", "share": 64, "start": 1954}, {"current": true, "id": 57, "member": 1329, "share": 64, "start": 1967}], "place_built": "St Peters, Guernsey", "previous_names": ["Hirondelle II"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Hirondelle was built on Guernsey in 1904.
