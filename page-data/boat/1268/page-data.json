She served her role to introduce the\nyounger members of the family to the joys of sailing just for fun. Perhaps she\nserved her role too well as I have now lost my crew to dinghy sailing. While\nthe crew hone their sailing skills in dinghy sailing, I will allow Ariel to\nfulfil her role for another family, while I seek a new project.\n\nAriel underwent a refit\n<a href=\"https://arielgreystones.com/refit-of-ariel/\" target=\"_PARENT\">as outlined on her website</a>\nand subsequent posts.\n\nAriel is a joy to sail with the family or single handed, she will be sorely missed.

Wicklow, Ireland.\n \nThe trailer is braked and un-sprung. I tow the boat and trailer using a 1.9 diesel\nVW Passat without any difficulty. Should Ariel find a new home in the\n UK or further afield I am happy to assist with the ferry crossing. I would\n tow the boat to the ferry and travel with the boat to the UK based ferry port\n [Hollyhead, Liverpool, Pembroke or Fishguard] for a hand over to the new custodian.\n \n An option to keep the towing weight to a minimum would be to ship the Pig Iron\n ballast, warps rigging anchor etc. via a courier as a pelleted shipment. This\n would reduce the towing weight by over 800 Kg making the towing will within\n the limits of a family car.\n \n If a prospective custodian wishes to view the boat I am more than happy to pick them up at the airport and drop\n them back after the viewing. I live circa 40 minutes from the airport.\n \n Storm, Working and racing Jib and Staysail are all if\n good working order\n \n - Topsail in good working order\n - Standing rigging was replaced with new SS in 2015\n - Running rigging all in good working order\n - Anchor with 6M of chain and 10M anchor line\n - 4 fenders with 2 mooring lines\n - Automatic bilge pump with 12 V battery\n - Custom built 4 wheel trailer\n - PVC tarpaulin with Boom Cover\n - beaching legs\n - Oars and Oar locks", "updated_at": "2020-05-03T10:13:13.173297+00:00"}, {"created_at": "2020-11-07T17:25:00.405242+00:00", "flexibility": "normal", "offered": "2020-11-07", "reduced": false, "sales_text": "<p>An attractive example of this iconic Falmouth working boat and trailer sailer.
