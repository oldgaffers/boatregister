She then had a taller mast, longer bowsprit and a gaff rig. She may have had an outboard well installed and was kept on a swinging mooring in the West Country.</p><p>She was bought in 2006 by a Mr Bullough, in Bere Ferris, who launched her twice. Oliver and Susan Nares purchased her in 2010 and have carried out much work. They have installed a hatch in the foredeck and both the fore and afterdecks now have laid iroko decking. Buoyancy tanks have been made for each side with side benches above. The cockpit has a slatted iroko floor and the running rigging has been improved. She retains her original tan main, but now has a slightly larger cream jib.</p>", "generic_type": "Dayboat", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.6764, "draft": 0.3566, "draft_keeldown": 0.9144111192392099, "fore_triangle_base": 2.081809314801268, "fore_triangle_height": 4.26725188978298, "length_on_deck": 4.8768, "length_on_waterline": 4.724457449402585, "length_over_all": 4.87685930260912, "main": {"foot": 2.996220434040478, "head": 2.43842965130456, "luff": 2.0330407217751767}, "thcf": 0.791842452}, "home_port": "Keyhaven", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "0d881365-3f53-48c0-bde4-48f36282bc8e", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Selkie", "oga_no": 3007, "ownerships": [{"name": "Oliver Nares", "share": 64, "start": 2010}], "rig_type": "Sloop", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Owners Oliver and Susan Nares believe the hull was made at Martin Heard's yard and completed as a \u2018home build\u2019 , probably by one of his workforce.</p>", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3007"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
