With the worst fears about her health soon realised, he was faced with the prospect of an enormous yard bill and decided to give up his job and perform drastic surgery himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of Windhover&#39;s troubles were electrolytic, iron strap floors with brass bolts and copper rivets, plus bronze bolts through the floors and into the lead keel. The floors fell to pieces when given an exploratory clout with a lump hammer, as did the mahogany planking when hit where the brass bolts were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting fact is that although evidence indicated she had never had any electrical systems except her Mag., most of her copper fastenings had badly wasted some, particularly those near to skin fittings (bronze) had wasted to green sludge at the timber/planking interface. To add to her troubles every single timber had broken due to severe over caulking, and her port and starboard lines were definitely not the same, both sides having twelve timbers broken in a row along one plank amidships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In places the gaps in the broken timbers, and many timbers were broken in two or more places, totalled over 1&frac12;&rdquo;. Other minor details were broken and there were rotted bilge stringers and a corroded water jacket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The job started very slowly as new skills were learned. She was re-planked from the waterline downwards and about 40% above in I&quot; mahogany; totally re-timbered in laminated rock elm, and has heavy pitch pine floors which span the bilge up to the stringers. The most awkward job, everything except the riveting being done single handed, was regaining the yacht&#39;s shape, this being accomplished by the use of internal Spanish windlasses, props, wedges, and a large hammer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decks which were yellow pine have been scarfed half-inch ply, glass sheathed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a bridge deck to accommodate the new Petter engine which lives where her companion doors used to be.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.3866, "draft": 1.143, "fore_triangle_base": 3.6972689587905387, "fore_triangle_height": 7.315288953913679, "length_on_deck": 7.7724, "length_on_waterline": 7.11209461107047, "length_over_all": 7.772506705681541, "main": {"foot": 4.163618629602536, "head": 3.706413069982931, "luff": 4.672640819312362}, "mizzen": {"foot": 2.9992684711046085, "head": 2.749329431845891, "luff": 3.0998536942209216}, "propellor": {"blades": 2, "type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 43.39872248869914, "thcf": 0.924}, "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "3e7a3580-babe-4d5c-9547-2a4d9a29d73f", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Windhover", "oga_no": 646, "ownerships": [{"name": "Edward Stevens", "share": 32, "start": 1991}, {"name": "Simon Rowden", "share": 32, "start": 1991}], "place_built": "Hythe", "rig_type": "Ketch", "sail_number": "646", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>&#39;Windhover&#39; is a 25ft ketch built of mahogany on elm by Morgan Giles in 1912.</p>", "uk_part1": "135646", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1912, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/646"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
