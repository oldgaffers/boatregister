She has a clinker construction with a near plumb\nstem and a long keel. She was built in 1894 by the apprentices of Adams Yard,\nGourock. She's been based on the Clyde ever since; as a victualling boat for the\nClyde islands, seeing service as a mail boat for the war ships in WWII, and as a\nCND peace boat in the 80s. She was built as a schooner but was converted to a\ngaff cutter rig in the 1920s. Around ten years ago she was abandoned,\nconfiscated by the yard, and was destined for the bonfire. Puffin was rescued at\nthe eleventh hour by my father and I. Sadly, my dad passed away suddenly shortly\nafter we took on Puffin, but I've continued the (fairly major restoration)\nmyself. I hope to get Puffin back on the water in the next year or two, and look\nforward to sailing the waters of the Scottish islands with my family and friends\nfor many years to come!</p>", "generic_type": ["Yacht"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.743, "draft": 1.829, "length_on_deck": 9.144, "length_on_waterline": 7.925, "length_over_all": 8.534}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Stornoway", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "7853fa84-bc7b-4be5-9736-f05c832ef4ce", "image_key": "Rv43vK", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Puffin", "oga_no": 96, "ownerships": [{"name": "I S Nicholls", "share": 64, "start": 1989}, {"current": true, "id": 35328, "member": 6397, "share": 64, "start": "2023"}], "place_built": "Gourock", "previous_names": ["Marjory"], "reference": ["Log 82/1, N/96"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "short_description": "<p>Puffin is a Victorian gaff cutter, originally built as a schooner in 1894.
