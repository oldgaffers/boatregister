She has a clinker construction with a near plumb stem and a long keel. She was built in 1894 by the apprentices of Adams Yard, Gourock. She's been based on the Clyde ever since; \u00a0as a victualling boat for the Clyde islands, seeing service as a mail boat for the war ships in WWII, and as a CND peace boat in the 80s. She was built as a schooner but was converted to a gaff cutter rig in the 1920s. Around ten years ago she was abandoned, confiscated by the yard, and was destined for the bonfire. Puffin was rescued at the eleventh hour by my father and I. Sadly, my dad passed away suddenly shortly after we took on Puffin, but I've continued the (fairly major restoration) myself. I hope to get Puffin back on the water in the next year or two, and look forward to sailing the waters of the Scottish islands with my family and friends for many years to come!</p>", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.7432333577176298, "draft": 1.8288222384784198, "length_on_waterline": 7.924896366739819, "length_over_all": 8.53450377956596}, "home_country": "United Kingdom", "home_port": "Glasgow", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "7853fa84-bc7b-4be5-9736-f05c832ef4ce", "image_key": "Rv43vK", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Puffin", "oga_no": 96, "ownerships": [{"name": "I S Nicholls", "share": 64, "start": 1989}], "place_built": "Gourock", "previous_names": ["Marjory"], "reference": ["Log 82/1, N/96"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "short_description": "Puffin is a Victorian gaff cutter, originally built as a schooner in 1894.
