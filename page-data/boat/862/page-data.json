She was kept in immaculate condition by the owner for 20 years until he was no longer able to use her in 1931. She was then bought by Maurice Griffiths who wrote about her in 'Ten Small Yachts' (whilst aboard her) and 'Magic of the Swatchways' She changed hands twice prior to the war, belonging to a Dr. Gordon Grenville and a Major Shackell who used her until the end of the war. She was then purchased by a yard and refitted internally as a speculation and sold to a Mr May. She was purchased in 1961 by a Mr. AF Braithwaite and a syndicate from Hertfordshire and had some \u00a3500 spent on her in a major refit. Mr. Morrison bought her in 1970 and cruised in Holland on the Ijsslemeer and around the Dutch Friesian Islands. She also went on the OGA Heineken Rally in 1974. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Saville bought her in 1976, only a matter of weeks before the East Coast Race. Martyn and Bryony Mackrill have owned <em>Nightfall</em> since March 1984.
