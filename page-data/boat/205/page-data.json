A raw oil engine\nwas therefore installed. After her service as a pilot boat she was sold to a person\nin Limhamn (outside Malm&ouml;) and was painted white.</p>\n<p>She was rigged with only one mast, and is said to have had terrible sailing properties.\nAfter some time she was sold to Limhamns Sj&ouml;scoutk&aring;r (sea scouts), still\nwith one mast but was painted black again.</p>\n<p>Later she ended up with\na captain from Norway, who understood that she needed her original ketch rig.\nHe was also responsible for the glass fibre sheathing (this was done around 1974-75).\nHer home port was Stockholm during this time.</p>\n<p>In 1990 she was bought by a sailmaker in Idrefjorden. He only kept her a short time\nand she was then bought by KFUK-KFUM:s Sj&ouml;scoutk&aring;r i Malm&ouml; (sea scouts) again.\nThey made some repairs and changes to the interior and sailed her for several\nyears.</p>\n<p>From 1999 she was laid up on land, unfortunately without\na cover. Wind and rain did some damage to the superstructure and the cockpit started\nto rot. She was a sad sight. The bowsprit had been broken and lay in pieces in\na shed nearby.</p>\n<p>She was gradually rebuilt between 2001-7 by Magnus Krampell, before he sold her.</p>\n<p>In her 2006 advertisement, she was described as 'a little ship with plenty of character'.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.1486, "draft": 1.7008, "length_on_deck": 8.51, "length_over_all": 8.500975371860521, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}}, "home_country": "SWE", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "b2370a6f-7881-4e38-911a-fa44e81f92be", "image_key": "dvCXBM", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Stout", "oga_no": 205, "place_built": "R\u00e5\u00e5, Sweden", "rig_type": "Ketch", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p><em>Stout</em> was built in 1907 for the Royal Pilot Administration\n(Kungliga Lotsstyrelsen) for service in &Ouml;resound under sail or power propulsion.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-TqRNhPr/0/Th/i-TqRNhPr-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1907, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/205"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
