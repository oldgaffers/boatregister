A raw oil engine was therefore installed.

After some time she was sold to Limhamns Sj&ouml;scoutk&aring;r (sea scouts), still with one mast but was painted black again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later she ended up with a captain from Norway, who understood that she needed her original ketch rig. He was also responsible for the glass fibre sheathing (this was done around 1974-75). Her home port was Stockholm during this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1990 she was bought by a sailmaker in Idrefjorden.

They made some repairs and changes to the interior and sailed her for several years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1999 she was laid up on land, unfortunately without a cover. Wind and rain did some damage to the superstructure and the cockpit started to rot. She was a sad sight. The bowsprit had been broken and lay in pieces in a shed nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was gradually rebuilt between 2001-7 by Magnus Krampell, before he sold her.</p>","image_key":"dvCXBM","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Ketch","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":"Oak on oak with substantial GRP skin","draft":1.7008,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":3.1516703243111435,"draft":1.7008046817849305,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":8.500975371860521},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.51,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;Stout&#39; was built 1907 for the Royal Pilot Administration (Kungliga Lotsstyrelsen) for service in &Ouml;resound under sail or power propulsion.
