'Memory' was built the year before, and 'Argo' the year after. \r\n\r\nShe sailed on the Norfolk broads, then from 1934 sailed out of Dover making frequent Channel crossings before  WWII.\r\n\r\nIn 1976 she moved to Maylandsea on the river Blackwater, competing in the OGA's East Coast Race in 1979 and 1980. In 1980  she won the Boat World Trophy, for coming first in Class II.\r\n\r\nAlthough of historical value she's had some difficult years recently, with a succession of owners taking her on, only to find she was \u201cmore of a project\u201d than they initially realised. Paul Goold installed 'Fleetwing' under a tent in the Heritage Marine boatyard in Essex where work on her is progressing steadily; the floors have being re galvanised and are back in.
