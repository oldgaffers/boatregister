A professional boat surveyor looked at her hull in November 2015 and came up with a schedule of work.","image_key":"9CvCQD","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"Pitch Pine on Oak","draft":1.3716,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.13362594489149,"main":{"foot":4.87685930260912,"head":4.191050963179712,"luff":4.26725188978298},"thcf":0.867700176,"draft":1.3716166788588149,"length_over_all":6.0960741282613995,"fore_triangle_base":3.3528407705437697,"length_on_waterline":5.4864667154352595,"fore_triangle_height":4.87685930260912},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.096,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;Fleetwing&#39; was the 2nd Harrison Butler Cruising yacht built, and the oldest now surviving.
