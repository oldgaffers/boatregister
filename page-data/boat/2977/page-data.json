At this\nstage she had a small cabin and and an old Stuart Turner. She was extensively\nrestored with a new cabin and a ketch rig by a Royal Engineer. She remained in\nKent until she was found in a sorry state in the 1990s. Restoration was started\nbut was discontinued.</p>\n<p>In 2000 she was bought by the present owner who returned her to the Isle of\nWight. Between 2000 and 2010 she was substantially re-built as a day boat by\nEddie Wade of Bembridge with a new keel and deck. Although the planking was in\nreasonable condition it was decided to spline her and add a double-skin of\nmahogany veneer. All oak frames and floors were replaced. Quemoy was fitted out\nby Bill Mitchell at AA Coombes.
