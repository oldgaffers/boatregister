However, she has spent the past few years out of the water, in a boatyard, in Suffolk. Unfortunately showing her age, and no longer seaworthy.</p>\n<p>In 2013, young gaffers Josh Masters and Sam Doman took on the project to return her to a seaworthy condition. They will have to remove all of the old steel and concrete ballast, and replace it with fresh steel and polyester resin (after making necessary repairs to the skin of the hull). They plan to re-make all of the spars: two new masts, two booms, a gaff, a topmast, and a bowsprit! Once the hull is sound, and re-ballasted, and the new spars made, they will replace all the rigging, and re-fit the interior. There are other, less major things to do along the way, such as over-hauling the engine (a marinised Landrover engine), repairing and re-sheathing the decks, reconditioning the paraffin stove and rebuilding the cockpit.</p>\n<p>Josh has recently finished his A-Levels, is an experienced sailor, and a capable engineer working in the marine industry. Sam is qualified and works as a traditional boatbuilder, and has sailed all over the globe. Between them, they have the skills necessary to get '<em>Annelis</em> back in the water, and sail her, aiming to take her across the Atlantic, to Central America. From here, they plan on continuing down the East coast of South America, around to Patagonia, and eventually around the world!</p>\n<p>2016 sees great progress with the hull completely intact again, ballast, engine and water tanks in and work underway with fitting out, on track for launching in the summer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ketch-annelis.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Follow their blog</a> which is updated with progress on the restoration of the boat, and eventually their expedition!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ketch.annelis/\" target=\"_blank\">2017 progress is documented on Facebook</a>.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.7338, "draft": 1.6764, "fore_triangle_base": 7.620092660326749, "fore_triangle_height": 8.53450377956596, "length_on_deck": 12.192, "length_on_waterline": 10.972933430870519, "length_over_all": 12.192148256522799, "main": {"foot": 4.953060229212387, "head": 3.6576444769568397, "luff": 6.949524506217996}, "mizzen": {"foot": 3.581443550353572, "luff": 8.53450377956596}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 1.0318412, "topsail": {"luff": 5.7912704218483295, "perpendicular": 3.0480370641306997}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Melton, Suffolk", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "3c925686-6de8-41a6-b8d7-6632d3681aae", "image_key": "6ghwsF", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Annelis", "oga_no": 2260, "ownerships": [{"end": 2018, "id": 196, "member": 2862, "share": 32, "start": 2000}, {"end": 2018, "id": 1134, "member": 2862, "share": 32, "start": 2000}, {"current": true, "id": 34880, "member": 6211, "share": 64, "start": 2018}], "place_built": "Newquay", "previous_names": ["Angharad"], "rig_type": "Ketch", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Annelis is a 40ft, ferrocement, gaff ketch.
