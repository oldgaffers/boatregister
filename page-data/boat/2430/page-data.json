In other words a resounding Don&rsquo;t Do It! So here goes.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Considered rationally, ie my wife&rsquo;s view, it looked like a bad idea right from the start Find a dilapidated wooden boat which when restored would be unsuitable for us, a retired couple out of the archetypal mould; he enthusiastic, she wary and happier in the garden; pour into the project a huge amount of money (which we didn&rsquo;t possess of course) far in excess of the vessel&rsquo;s potential value; continue living where we were, far from the sea; and finally sign up as a sort of superannuated apprentice to a professional boat builder who would sensibly regard that apprentice&rsquo;s role as being to make tea, sweep up, and only eventually, grudgingly, allow the most boring and menial tasks to be carried out on the boat itself.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Yes, this was to be a retirement project. A way of achieving a painless transition from a busy and stressful working life to a busy, stressful retirement. In this respect at least it couldn&rsquo;t have been better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Charm&rsquo;, already known to me for many years, was rediscovered in a far corner of an Essex boatyard, looking forlorn and very wet. She was built in 1922, a 33ft counter-stern gaff yawl, and a slightly stretched version (by one-eighth) of the Albert Strange &lsquo;Venture&rsquo; which was his last design (he died in 1917). Potentially very pretty. My wife, misunderstanding my sales pitch, commented that if I were at last to acquire charm she would indeed be delighted; so I quickly took advantage and handed over the modest purchase price.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Trundled home to our back garden in rural Bucks., the boat proceeded to sit for a year waiting for my actual retirement. During that year I tackled a few tasks like cleaning up the name boards (very urgent that, anything to show that the job was underway) and chipping away ineffectively at many layers of (probably lead-based) paint, including the antifouling which a previous hopeful had somewhat prematurely applied.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Then, in the first 18 months of real retirement, came the big push forward. &#39;Charm&#39; was moved to the boat builders&rsquo; shed, on an Essex farm near Maldon, and then for me began a commuting existence, inevitably via the M25, and averaging three days on and four off, time for partial recovery, and whilst &lsquo;on&rsquo; living in an old caravan parked on the farm. An extract from my diary at the time describes something of life through the first winter: &ldquo;When the farmer first showed us to our pitch he referred to the wonderful sense of solitude we could expect in this remote part of Essex. He spoke truly. Tucked up inside the caravan on this freezing winters evening, with something shrieking outside (could be owls; could be demented locals) there is solitude to spare.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A few other memories of the project at this time, during which morale could be quite difficult to sustain: the frequent sense at the end of a very long day that we were further away from a restored boat than we had been that morning: feeling that 90% of the tasks I was assigned (when eventually deemed capable enough) like making in-situ scarfe joints for instance, would have been easier had I not been left-handed, let alone cack-handed: and thinking when endlessly loading the pot-bellied stove, our only source of heat during the winter, with scrap wood - often discarded planking - that &lsquo;Burning your Boats&rsquo; was indeed a relevant phrase.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>But at the same time there were compensations. Discovering that wooden boat construction is fascinating: a mix of often very crude technology (the lash-ups we used for steaming timber for instance) coupled with incredible skill, such as shaping a plank to fit precisely into a complex three-dimensional space between two others. Slowly even I acquired a few basic skills by watching the others at work.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>At the end of this period both I and the original funds were exhausted, so a structurally-complete but far from finished hull returned to our back garden. Worse still, this was at about the time, nearly three years in, when the boat should have been out there and sailing, if things had gone according to plan.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Another year passed. Slow, slow progress, without any helpful voice at my elbow to say &lsquo;you&rsquo;re doing it all wrong&rsquo;. Amazingly however, in a village 100 miles from the coast, there was now another sea-going boat, a home-completion Hunter 31, right next door. So a fair amount of two-way moral and practical support ensued; better-still, this invaluable neighbour possessed a serious workshop equipped with a band saw, planer-thicknesser for a task involving him, initially at least, in GRP construction!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Furthermore the race was on: who would be afloat first? [He was, dammit.]</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Eventually, the house re-mortgaged, holidays away a thing of the past, it was the final push. We were back down to Maldon for caulking, then painting, painting and more painting, and finally being dumped without much ceremony into a mud-berth to &lsquo;take up&rsquo; (after perhaps 20 years out of the water). We took a triumphant maiden voyage, sans rig but under engine (a new Betamarine) and almost leak-free, down the Blackwater.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Then last summer, and after five long years, everything else came together, and surprisingly quickly; rigging, spars, and sails, the latter a beautifully made suit in Clipper canvas. Not that even then she was really finished of course. But there was nothing for it but to go out for a proper sail, and hope for a few admiring comments. Inevitably no-one said very much: the East Coast is a bit blas&eacute; about pretty boats. But for me; at last it all seemed to have been worthwhile.</blockquote>","image_key":"44NMJ4","uk_part1":"144126","rig_type":"Yawl","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pine on oak","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Canoe Yawl","handicap_data":{"beam":2.3104120946110704,"draft":1.5240185320653499,"length_over_all":10.05852231163131,"length_on_waterline":7.620092660326749},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.0584,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>Built in 1922, &#39;Charm&#39; is one of several boats with the same name attributed to Albert Strange.
