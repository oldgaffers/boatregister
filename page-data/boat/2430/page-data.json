In other words a resounding Don\u2019t Do It! So here goes.</p>\n<p>Considered rationally, ie my wife\u2019s view, it looked like a bad idea right from\nthe start Find a dilapidated wooden boat which when restored would be unsuitable\nfor us, a retired couple out of the archetypal mould; he enthusiastic, she wary\nand happier in the garden; pour into the project a huge amount of money (which\nwe didn\u2019t possess of course) far in excess of the vessel\u2019s potential value;\ncontinue living where we were, far from the sea; and finally sign up as a sort\nof superannuated apprentice to a professional boat builder who would sensibly\nregard that apprentice\u2019s role as being to make tea, sweep up, and only\neventually, grudgingly, allow the most boring and menial tasks to be carried out\non the boat itself.</p>\n<p>Yes, this was to be a retirement project. A way of achieving a painless\ntransition from a busy and stressful working life to a busy, stressful\nretirement. In this respect at least it couldn\u2019t have been better.</p>\n<p>\u2018Charm\u2019, already known to me for many years, was rediscovered in a far corner of\nan Essex boatyard, looking forlorn and very wet. She was built in 1922, a 33ft\ncounter-stern gaff yawl, and a slightly stretched version (by one-eighth) of the\nAlbert Strange \u2018Venture\u2019 which was his last design (he died in 1917).\nPotentially very pretty. My wife, misunderstanding my sales pitch, commented\nthat if I were at last to acquire charm she would indeed be delighted; so I\nquickly took advantage and handed over the modest purchase price.</p>\n<p>Trundled home to our back garden in rural Bucks., the boat proceeded to sit for\na year waiting for my actual retirement. During that year I tackled a few tasks\nlike cleaning up the name boards (very urgent that, anything to show that the\njob was underway) and chipping away ineffectively at many layers of (probably\nlead-based) paint, including the antifouling which a previous hopeful had\nsomewhat prematurely applied.</p>\n<p>Then, in the first 18 months of real retirement, came the big push forward.\n'Charm' was moved to the boat builders\u2019 shed, on an Essex farm near Maldon, and\nthen for me began a commuting existence, inevitably via the M25, and averaging\nthree days on and four off, time for partial recovery, and whilst \u2018on\u2019 living in\nan old caravan parked on the farm. An extract from my diary at the time\ndescribes something of life through the first winter: \u201cWhen the farmer first\nshowed us to our pitch he referred to the wonderful sense of solitude we could\nexpect in this remote part of Essex. He spoke truly. Tucked up inside the\ncaravan on this freezing winters evening, with something shrieking outside\n(could be owls; could be demented locals) there is solitude to spare.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few other memories of the project at this time, during which morale could be\nquite difficult to sustain: the frequent sense at the end of a very long day\nthat we were further away from a restored boat than we had been that morning:\nfeeling that 90% of the tasks I was assigned (when eventually deemed capable\nenough) like making in-situ scarfe joints for instance, would have been easier\nhad I not been left-handed, let alone cack-handed: and thinking when endlessly\nloading the pot-bellied stove, our only source of heat during the winter, with\nscrap wood - often discarded planking - that \u2018Burning your Boats\u2019 was indeed a\nrelevant phrase.</p>\n<p>But at the same time there were compensations. Discovering that wooden boat\nconstruction is fascinating: a mix of often very crude technology (the lash-ups\nwe used for steaming timber for instance) coupled with incredible skill, such as\nshaping a plank to fit precisely into a complex three-dimensional space between\ntwo others. Slowly even I acquired a few basic skills by watching the others at\nwork.</p>\n<p>At the end of this period both I and the original funds were exhausted, so a\nstructurally-complete but far from finished hull returned to our back garden.\nWorse still, this was at about the time, nearly three years in, when the boat\nshould have been out there and sailing, if things had gone according to plan.</p>\n<p>Another year passed. Slow, slow progress, without any helpful voice at my elbow\nto say \u2018you\u2019re doing it all wrong\u2019. Amazingly however, in a village 100 miles\nfrom the coast, there was now another sea-going boat, a home-completion Hunter\n31, right next door. So a fair amount of two-way moral and practical support\nensued; better-still, this invaluable neighbour possessed a serious workshop\nequipped with a band saw, planer-thicknesser for a task involving him, initially\nat least, in GRP construction!</p>\n<p>Furthermore the race was on: who would be afloat first? [He was, dammit.]</p>\n<p>Eventually, the house re-mortgaged, holidays away a thing of the past, it was\nthe final push. We were back down to Maldon for caulking, then painting,\npainting and more painting, and finally being dumped without much ceremony into\na mud-berth to \u2018take up\u2019 (after perhaps 20 years out of the water). We took a\ntriumphant maiden voyage, sans rig but under engine (a new Betamarine) and\nalmost leak-free, down the Blackwater.</p>\n<p>Then last summer, and after five long years, everything else came together, and\nsurprisingly quickly; rigging, spars, and sails, the latter a beautifully made\nsuit in Clipper canvas. Not that even then she was really finished of course.\nBut there was nothing for it but to go out for a proper sail, and hope for a few\nadmiring comments. Inevitably no-one said very much: the East Coast is a bit\nblas\u00e9 about pretty boats. But for me; at last it all seemed to have been\nworthwhile.</p>\n</blockquote>", "generic_type": "Canoe Yawl", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.31, "draft": 1.524, "fore_triangle_base": 4.389, "fore_triangle_height": 8.099, "length_on_deck": 10.058, "length_on_waterline": 7.62, "length_over_all": 10.058, "main": {"foot": 4.56, "head": 4.572, "luff": 4.7}, "mizzen": {"foot": 2.527, "luff": 4.889}, "mizzen_topsail": {}, "propellor": {"type": "feathering"}, "solent": {"hull_shape": "Long keel - Standard", "measured_rating": 25.47900764598223, "performance_factor": " ", "thcf": 1.001}, "thcf": 1.009, "topsail": {"luff": 5.078, "perpendicular": 2.499}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Walton Backwaters", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "580f3164-fafb-4972-9f61-f224f3d25001", "image_key": "44NMJ4", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Charm", "oga_no": 2430, "ownerships": [{"end": 2013, "id": 35093, "member": 6648, "share": 64, "start": 2000}, {"end": 2019, "name": "Robert Westling", "share": 64, "start": 2013}, {"current": true, "id": 34965, "member": 6556, "share": 64, "start": 2019}], "place_built": "Cantley", "rig_type": "Yawl", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Built in 1922, 'Charm' is one of several boats with the same name attributed to\nAlbert Strange.
