Robert Taylor had previously started the restoration, but\nsadly died after owning her for just a year, having only managed to remove the\nrotten cabin top and coamings.</p>\n<p>Built in Teignmouth in 1912 by Gann &amp; Palmer, whose business ended when their\nyard was destroyed by fire, 'White Cloud' is obviously based on the lines of a\nFalmouth Quay Punt, and is gaff rigged with a Bermudan (leg of mutton) mizzen.\nShe has a straight stem and transom stern and is 25ft along the deck and\nwaterline. With bowsprit and bumpkin she'll be about 35ft in total.</p>\n<p>Despite being 100 years old, the pitch pine planking was all in good condition\nand only five frames needed attention. All the nails and roves needed hardening\nup and the other original, galvanised, fixings were merely a memory of rust!\nNotes from the registrar of ships suggested that she was built for a 'Gentleman'\n(Col. Golightly of Torquay), however documents at the Teignmouth and Shaldon\nMuseum (who have some of the yard records) say that she was orderd by, and built\nfor, Peter Hoare of the famous banking family. She has an impressive list of\nprevious owners (including Lord Cranbrook in the late 1920s).</p>\n<p>Les Weeks' restoration is as 'in keeping' as possible, but with no original\naccommodation plans, this was slightly imaginative. He was fortunate to meet\nsome of the previous owners, one of whom sailed her to Finland, with wife and\nthree daughters, in the early 1950s. Hopefully she'll still be that seaworthy\nwhen restored.</p>\n<p>In 2012 Les received a Transort Trust Restoration Award for his work in\nrestoring 'White Cloud'.</p>\n<p>Finally re-launched in September 2013, she had one outing in October before the\nseason ended. In 2014 she sailed on the Blackwater and in September entered the\nMaldon Town Regatta where the first, post restoration, photos of her afloat were\ntaken.</p>\n<p>The next priority was some new sails as some of the existing ones were date\nstamped 1963! The replacements were designed and made by Mark Butler at James\nLawrence in Brightingsea, in 2015-16. After about ten years at Downs Road\nBoatyard in Maldon, including six for the restoration, in 2015 'White Cloud' was\nmoved to Bradwell Marina, still flying the burgee of the Maldon Little Ship Club\n(MLSC).</p>\n<p>Sold in 2019 to Paul Stevens who sailed her to Portugal in 2019, returning in\n2020 after the ports reopened.
