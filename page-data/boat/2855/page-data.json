Her engine is a Kohler diesel engine series\nKDW model 702. It is a   four-stroke diesel engine with two cylinders in line\nliquid cooled.   Fitted in 2021   The engine turns a Featherstream folding\npropeller.   Other mechanical gear, Lofrans electric Anchor Winch and\nRaymarine Autopilot. <br />\nRig <br />\nTechnically in the UK she\u2019s a ketch as her mizzenmast is stepped forward of the rudder but Phil Bolger called her a yawl\nbecause in America their definition is slightly different.   Her mainmast isstepped very far forward in a Broards type tabernacle. The mizzen sail is\nfurled revolving it\u2019s mast which has   a furling drum just above the deck.\nOriginally the mizzenmast   would be simply lifted out and in for low bridges and maintenance   but she now has a clamp on hinged strut which makes the\nprocess less exciting. The masts and gaff are made from carbon fibre tubes supplied by Compotech Booms, the other spars   Douglas Fir.   Sails   Main jib\nand ghoster by Jeckles and mizzen by Wilkinson Sails.   Her boomed Jib is semi balanced, it\u2019s pivot is slightly back from the tack, which prevents the aft end\nlifting to much as the sheet is released. There are lines attached to the forward end of the boom which lead back to the cockpit down each side of the deck. When   running before the wind\nas the main starts to blanket the jib, a   sharp pull on the leeward line will  swing the jib out to windward   where it will pull beautifully.   There are\ntracks along the gunwales so she could sheet a variety   of headsails but she sails so well with her working jib that she no   longer uses any.   The gaff\nmainsail is loose footed with a clew attached to a car so   the draft of the sail can be adjusted to suit the wind direction.   Accommodation   She sleeps\nfour, which includes two in a double cross-berth at the   forward end of the saloon, it has doors so can be shut away.   The saloon is accessed via steep\nsteps down from the bridge   deck, to port is the galley with sink, a worktop and a Nelson gas   cooker, then a Taylors diesel fuelled cabin heater, then a\nhanging   cupboard which is accessed from forward and then a settee berth. To starboard is a door to the heads compartment which contains   a Lavac marine\ntoilet, a sit down/crouch down shower, a wash   basin and access to storage under the bridge-deck. The waste  from the toilet can be either pumped straight\ninto the sea or in a   holding tank for disposal ashore. Next is the chart table with a   fridge under the seat and then another settee berth. The cockpit\nseats are long enough to sleep on and she has an inflatable   cockpit tent that has never been used. <br />\nThe Hull <br />\nThe strip-planked hull (Cedar?) and marine ply deck, all sheathed with glass and epoxy was built by Spirit Yachts Ltd of Ipswich. She was then completed by her owner Robert Berk who had   previously\ndesigned and made things for a living. While a student  he had been awarded a City and Guilds Silver Medal for Cabinet   making. In spite of having her under\ncover next to his house and   workshop and working on her almost full time it took him three years to complete her. <br />\nPerformance   How does she sail? \nThe answer really well. The Old Gaffers   Association class her as a Hot Shot their  definition being boats built for racing, when in fact she is a comfortable well equipped   cruising\nyacht.  </p>"}], "full_description": "<p>Built in 2005 of strip construction in Suffolk and Essex, Crow is based in Faversham. She is a centreboard gaff ketch based on Phil Bolger's Moccasin\ndesign and incorporates many modern features such as carbon fibre mast and spars. The mizzen furls by revolving the mast.\n Phil Bolger designed a series of Shoal draft centreboard yachts \u201cinspired\u201d by Thames sailing barges in that they rely on flat mid   sections and\n  vertical sides to provide much of their stability but  have beautifully shaped ends to help them ease their way through   the waves. Because they don\u2019t need a\n  lot of ballast to simply hold   them down in the water they are light and easily driven and   therefore fast. Apparently some people are concerned about the\n  seagoing   capabilities of Phil Bolger\u2019s shoal-draft designs, but Crow\u2019s bigger sister the schooner Barn Owl, 50ft on deck 3ft draft with centreboards raised\n  sailed to America and back with no problems.   And the smaller Cat ketch Rhomp  30ft on deck 18ins draft with centerboard up and no and no engine sailed right\n  through the eye   of a hurricane without unduly frightening her single handed skipper though his mizzen sail did disintegrate. Crow has sailed to Holland\n  and as far as Penzance without any   problems. One aspect of these designs which can be amusing is  that skippers of other yachts assume that because of their\n  size   there must be plenty of water under them. One example was in   Crow racing in the rivers above Harwich when a bigger faster  yacht tried to\n  overtake us to windward when we were scooting through the shallows with the centerboard up. Not a good idea.  We had an exhilarating run up the Chanel\n  while returning from   Cornwall. The wind was gusting force 7 from behind. With  just   the jib and the mizzen set and the engine running quietly it was  pure\n  joy.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.987, "draft": 0.64, "draft_keeldown": 1.9050231650816873, "fore_triangle_base": 4.1849548890514505, "fore_triangle_height": 9.168495488905144, "length_on_deck": 11.582, "length_on_waterline": 10.338941721531334, "length_over_all": 11.582540843696659, "length_over_spars": 15.240185320653499, "main": {"foot": 7.162887100707144, "head": 5.462082418922214, "luff": 5.4864667154352595}, "mizzen": {"foot": 3.1303340648622284, "luff": 5.462082418922214}, "propellor": {"type": "folding"}, "sailarea": 69.14691905734976, "thcf": 1.038}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Faversham", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "28d9af22-e159-45cb-bd28-184d2cdcad98", "image_key": "wwNZLg", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Crow", "oga_no": 2855, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 149, "member": 2336, "share": 64, "start": 2000}], "place_built": "Essex & Suffolk", "rig_type": "Ketch", "selling_status": "for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Crow is a centreboard gaff ketch based on Phil Bolger's Moccasin design.</p>", "ssr": "118688", "year": 2005, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2855"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
