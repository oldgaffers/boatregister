The\nchildren want <em>Crow</em> to go to someone who will sail her and love her as much as\nhe loves her.</p>\n<p><em>Crow</em> is a 38ft shoal daft ketch with a centreboard, based on Phil Bolger\u2019s\nMoccasin Design. She is however, slightly longer, heavier and rigged with a\nGaff. Length on deck 38ft Length over Spars 50ft Beam 10ft Draft centreboard\nraised 2ft Draft centreboard down 5ft 9ins Included in her draft is a 10ins deep\nfull length keel which contains nearly 3000lbs of lead located around her centre\nboard slot. Her engine is a Kohler diesel engine series KDW model 702. It is a\nfour-stroke diesel engine with two cylinders in line liquid cooled. Fitted in\n2021 The engine turns a Featherstream folding propeller. Other mechanical gear,\nLofrans electric Anchor Winch and Raymarine Autopilot.\u00a0   <strong>Rig</strong>   Technically\nin the UK she\u2019s a ketch as her mizzenmast is stepped forward of the rudder but\nPhil Bolger called her a yawl because in America their definition is slightly\ndifferent. Her mainmast isstepped very far forward in a Broards type tabernacle.\nThe mizzen sail is furled revolving it\u2019s mast which has a furling drum just\nabove the deck. Originally the mizzenmast would be simply lifted out and in for\nlow bridges and maintenance but she now has a clamp on hinged strut which makes\nthe process less exciting. The masts and gaff are made from carbon fibre tubes\nsupplied by Compotech Booms, the other spars Douglas Fir. Sails Main jib and\nghoster by Jeckles and mizzen by Wilkinson Sails.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her boomed Jib is semi balanced, it\u2019s pivot is slightly back from the tack,\nwhich prevents the aft end lifting to much as the sheet is released. There are\nlines attached to the forward end of the boom which lead back to the cockpit\ndown each side of the deck. When running before the wind as the main starts to\nblanket the jib, a sharp pull on the leeward line will swing the jib out to\nwindward where it will pull beautifully. There are tracks along the gunwales so\nshe could sheet a variety of headsails but she sails so well with her working\njib that she no longer uses any.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gaff mainsail is loose footed with a clew attached to a car so the draft of\nthe sail can be adjusted to suit the wind direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Accommodation</strong></p>\n<p>She sleeps four, which includes two in a double cross-berth at the forward end\nof the saloon, it has doors so can be shut away. The saloon is accessed via\nsteep steps down from the bridge deck, to port is the galley with sink, a\nworktop and a Nelson gas cooker, then a Taylors diesel fuelled cabin heater,\nthen a hanging cupboard which is accessed from forward and then a settee berth.\nTo starboard is a door to the heads compartment which contains a Lavac marine\ntoilet, a sit down/crouch down shower, a wash basin and access to storage under\nthe bridge-deck. The waste from the toilet can be either pumped straight into\nthe sea or in a holding tank for disposal ashore. Next is the chart table with a\nfridge under the seat and then another settee berth. The cockpit seats are long\nenough to sleep on and she has an inflatable cockpit tent that has never been\nused.\u00a0   <strong>The Hull</strong>   The strip-planked hull (Cedar?) and marine ply deck, all\nsheathed with glass and epoxy was built by Spirit Yachts Ltd of Ipswich. She was\nthen completed by her owner Robert Berk who had previously designed and made\nthings for a living. While a student he had been awarded a City and Guilds\nSilver Medal for Cabinet making. In spite of having her under cover next to his\nhouse and workshop and working on her almost full time it took him three years\nto complete her.\u00a0   <strong>Performance</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How does she sail? The answer? Really well. The Old Gaffers Association class\nher as a Hot Shot their definition being boats built for racing, when in fact\nshe is a comfortable well equipped cruising yacht.</p>"}], "full_description": "<p>Built in 2005 of strip construction in Suffolk and Essex, <em>Crow</em> is based in\nFaversham. She is a centreboard gaff ketch based on Phil Bolger's Moccasin\ndesign and incorporates many modern features such as carbon fibre mast and\nspars. The mizzen furls by revolving the mast.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phil Bolger designed a series of Shoal draft centreboard yachts \u201cinspired\u201d by\nThames sailing barges in that they rely on flat mid sections and vertical sides\nto provide much of their stability but have beautifully shaped ends to help them\nease their way through the waves. Because they don\u2019t need a lot of ballast to\nsimply hold them down in the water they are light and easily driven and\ntherefore fast. Apparently some people are concerned about the seagoing\ncapabilities of Phil Bolger\u2019s shoal-draft designs, but <em>Crow</em>\u2019s bigger sister\nthe schooner <em>Barn Owl</em>, 50ft on deck 3ft draft with centreboards raised sailed\nto America and back with no problems. And the smaller Cat ketch <em>Rhomp</em> 30ft on\ndeck 18ins draft with centerboard up and no and no engine sailed right through\nthe eye of a hurricane without unduly frightening her single handed skipper\nthough his mizzen sail did disintegrate.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Crow</em> has sailed to Holland and as far as Penzance without any problems. One\naspect of these designs which can be amusing is that skippers of other yachts\nassume that because of their size there must be plenty of water under them. One\nexample was in <em>Crow</em> racing in the rivers above Harwich when a bigger faster\nyacht tried to overtake us to windward when we were scooting through the\nshallows with the centerboard up. Not a good idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We had an exhilarating run up the Chanel while returning from Cornwall. The wind\nwas gusting force 7 from behind. With just the jib and the mizzen set and the\nengine running quietly it was pure joy.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.987, "draft": 0.64, "draft_keeldown": 1.9050231650816873, "fore_triangle_base": 4.1849548890514505, "fore_triangle_height": 9.168495488905144, "length_on_deck": 11.582, "length_on_waterline": 10.338941721531334, "length_over_all": 11.582540843696659, "length_over_spars": 15.240185320653499, "main": {"foot": 7.162887100707144, "head": 5.462082418922214, "luff": 5.4864667154352595}, "mizzen": {"foot": 3.1303340648622284, "luff": 5.462082418922214}, "propellor": {"type": "folding"}, "sailarea": 69.14691905734976, "thcf": 1.038}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Faversham", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "28d9af22-e159-45cb-bd28-184d2cdcad98", "image_key": "wwNZLg", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Crow", "oga_no": 2855, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 149, "member": 2336, "share": 64, "start": 2000}], "place_built": "Essex & Suffolk", "rig_type": "Ketch", "selling_status": "for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Crow is a centreboard gaff ketch based on Phil Bolger's Moccasin design.</p>", "ssr": "118688", "year": 2005, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2855"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
