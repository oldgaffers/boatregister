The yard later became McGrouthers. <br />\nAs originally built, she was a transom stern sloop. She was altered to a canoe yawl in time for the 1909 season, less than a year after McKellar's had launched her. One conceivable inspiration for the change may have been that the Albert Strange, <em>Sheila</em> (1904) was based on the Clyde in 1908. The two yawls have very similar dimensions, and not dissimilar sail areas. However,her deck plan could not have been the same as Mylne had drawn for the sloop, though there were photographs of it. A canoe stern is visible as a hand-drawn addition to her original plans. There are butt joints on her planking where the canoe stern was added. <br />\n<em>Maid of Lorn</em> was owned for most of the 1930 by Gladys Coulson, who married Ian G Gilchrist, marine photographer. Needless to say, from the 1930s to the 50s he contributed lots of photographs of the boat to the yachting press. Later, the main was converted to Bermudan and a rather unsightly cabin top was added to provide standing headroom below. <br />\n John Blackie rescued her in the 1980s and restored her to her 1909 condition. <br />\nIn 2007, Mark Butler at James Lawrence made copies of a set of her unusable vertically panelled tanned sails which had not been used since the early 1950s.Cranfield (of Burnham on Crouch) had provided sails in 1930 and, assuming this was indeed the case, their style and details indicate they were copies of her first set. <br />\nToday, she is the sole small Edwardian cruising yacht of Mylne design to survive. She is also the oldest yacht in sailing order on the Clyde. <br />\nAside from her liking for being cosseted, <em>Maid of Lorn</em> has a vice that can be made to disappear simply enough. She carries weather helm when under full main, but which is simply curable by taking in a single reef. She stays upright and cuts through waves and happily sails under mizzen and jib alone.</p>", "generic_type": ["Yacht"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.234, "draft": 1.219, "length_on_deck": 6.782, "length_on_waterline": 5.791, "length_over_all": 6.782}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Rhu", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "image_key": "6Vshdw", "lastModified": "2025-11-12T13:59:37Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Maid of Lorn", "oga_no": 2316, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 34601, "member": 6364, "share": 64, "start": 1980}], "place_built": "Kilcreggan", "reference": ["Water Craft Jul/Aug 97", "Gaffers Log 119"], "rig_type": "Yawl", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Launched with a sloop rig, during her first winter ashore a canoe stern and\nmizzen was added.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2025-11-12", "year": 1908, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2316"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
