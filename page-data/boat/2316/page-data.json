The yard later became McGrouthers.\nAs originally built, she was a transom stern sloop. She was altered \nto a canoe yawl in time for the 1909 season, less than a year \nafter McKellar's had launched her.\nOne conceivable inspiration for the change may have been that the\nAlbert Strange, <em>Sheila</em> (1904) was based on the Clyde in 1908. The\ntwo yawls have very similar dimensions, and not dissimilar sail areas.\nHowever,her deck plan could not have been the same as Mylne had drawn\nfor the sloop, though there were photographs of it. A canoe stern is \nvisible as a hand-drawn addition to her original plans. There are\nbutt joints on her planking where the canoe stern was\nadded.\n<em>Maid of Lorn</em> was owned for most of the 1930 by Gladys Coulson,\nwho married Ian G Gilchrist, marine photographer. Needless to say, \nfrom the 1930s to the 50s he contributed lots of photographs of\nthe boat to the yachting press. Later, the main was converted to \nBermudan and a rather unsightly cabin top was added to provide\nstanding headroom below.\u00a0\nJohn Blackie rescued  her and restored her to her 1909 condition.\nIn 2007, Mark Butler at James Lawrence made copies of a set of her \nunusable vertically panelled tanned sails which had not been used \nsince the early 1950s.Cranfield (of Burnham on Crouch) had provided \nsails in 1930 and, assuming this was indeed the case, their style \nand details indicate they were copies of her first set.\nToday, she is the sole small Edwardian cruising yacht of Mylne design \nto survive. She is also the oldest yacht in sailing order on the Clyde.\nAside from her liking  for being cosseted, <em>Maid of Lorn</em> has a vice \nthat can be made to disappear simply enough. She carries weather helm \nwhen under full main, but which is simply curable by taking in a single \nreef.\u00a0She stays upright and cuts through waves and happily sails under \nmizzen and jib alone.</p>", "generic_type": ["Yacht"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.234, "draft": 1.219, "length_on_deck": 6.782, "length_on_waterline": 5.791, "length_over_all": 6.782}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Rhu", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "image_key": "6Vshdw", "lastModified": "2025-10-23T22:13:34Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Maid of Lorn", "oga_no": 2316, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 34601, "member": 6364, "share": 64, "start": 1980}], "place_built": "Kilcreggan", "reference": ["Water Craft Jul/Aug 97", "Gaffers Log 119"], "rig_type": "Yawl", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Launched with a sloop rig, during her first winter ashore a canoe stern and mizzen was added.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2025-11-12", "year": 1908, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2316"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
