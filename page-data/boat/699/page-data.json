Designed by Nigel Warrington Smyth, a talented amateur designer based in the West Country.  Her bold sheer is said to be typical of his designs.  There is a brief summary of some of her early history and a lines drawing in the Gaffers Log 1983/2. Romney Fox owned her for 30 years and sailed her extensively in the English Channel. Her second owner was J. Bart Pot, a Dutch engineer based in London. He replaced the engine, added a doghouse and wheel steering, and kept her at Gosport. There she regularly raced with the South Coast OGA and in Barts hands she almost invariably won something.  He cruised in the Channel and also made several trips to Holland. The photo shows Dreva in the EC race in 1974, the day before the start of the Heineken rally to Amsterdam in which she took part.  Dreva is a large boat for her size, heavily built and very robust and seaworthy.  Bart took her out in all weathers but it was hardly ever necessary to reef the mainsail. He kept her for 10 years. Subsequent owners removed the doghouse so her appearance is more in keeping with the original. <p>> is an old Cornish name, sometimes pronounced  \u2018dreeva\u2019.  Both Romney Fox and Bart Pot however called her \u2018dreva\u2019 ( rhymes with clever).", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.048, "draft": 1.8898, "length_on_deck": 10.3937, "length_on_waterline": 9.1441111923921, "length_over_all": 10.393806388685686}, "home_port": "Port Penryn", "id": "51df48fd-b83d-4874-842f-6c67e4710cf7", "image_key": "j2fNtQ", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Dreva", "oga_no": 699, "ownerships": [{"end": 2013, "name": "Joe Ormond", "share": 64, "start": 2012}], "place_built": "Mevagissey", "previous_names": ["Happy Return"], "reference": ["Log 1983/2"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Dreva was built in 1936 for George Romney Fox (1898 \u2013 1968), a Falmouth timber merchant.
