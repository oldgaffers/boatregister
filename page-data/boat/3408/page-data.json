Maurice Griffiths designed her sail plan, a friend of the commissioning skipper. 'She\"s a sturdy vessel, perfectly balanced and a delight to sail, with excellent sail options for a vessel of this type', said John, who refurbished her between 2001 and 2007. She is currently on the hard for the annual pre season jobs, John is doing some serious British cruising this year.</p></blockquote><p>A pre sale survey on water performed by Adrian Overbury December 2019 'an immensely strong vessel' quote by the first survey by traditional surveyor Adrian Overbury 1999). &nbsp;Aug 2015;&nbsp;Antifouled, mast unstepped &amp; full 6 coat re-varnish to both new mizzen &amp; main mast, Houdini hatch lazzerette coachroof &amp; blocks.Topsides sanded undercoated &amp; repainted with Toplac gloss.<br />&nbsp;</p><h3>Brief refurbishment details</h3><p>The hull was stripped back of everything bar the keelson leaving the sheer planks to be replaced, the rest of the Honduras mahogany planking is in excellent condition as is the oak keelson.
