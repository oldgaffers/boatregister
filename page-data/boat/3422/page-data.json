Early versions were sold to yacht and smack owners as tenders and many shells were fitted out by enthusiastic amateurs. By the late eighties the mould was worn out and an injection of cash and enthusiasm was needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maldon boatbuilder Brian Kennell acquired the mould and rights to produce the Smacks Boat. Since then he has been steadily building Smacks Boats for an enthusiastic East Coast clientele for the last 25 years.
