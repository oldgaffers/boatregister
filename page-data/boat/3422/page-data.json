Early versions were sold to yacht and smack owners as tenders and many\nshells were fitted out by enthusiastic amateurs. By the late eighties the mould\nwas worn out and an injection of cash and enthusiasm was needed.</p>\n<p>Maldon boatbuilder Brian Kennell acquired the mould and rights to produce the\nSmacks Boat. Since then he has been steadily building Smacks Boats for an\nenthusiastic East Coast clientele for the last 25 years. Every boat built by\nBrian has been fitted out to the client's individual specification.</p>", "generic_type": "Dinghy", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.524, "displacement": 114, "draft": 0.152, "draft_keel_down": 0.838, "length_on_deck": 3.734, "length_on_waterline": 3.658, "length_over_spars": 3.734, "length_overall": 3.734, "main": {"foot": 3.301, "head": 3.301, "luff": 1.295}, "moving_keel": true, "moving_keel_type": "Centreboard", "propellor": {"type": "none"}, "sailarea": 7.618, "solent": {"hull_shape": "Long keel - Standard", "measured_rating": 16.26915951996817, "thcf": 0.879}, "thcf": 0.737}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Salisbury", "hull_form": "centre-board dinghy", "id": "3dab62e0-22cb-48fb-af73-2aa63d7faceb", "image_key": "dRLhhz", "mainsail_type": "lug", "name": "Joy", "oga_no": 3422, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 394, "member": 4164, "share": 64, "start": 2019}], "place_built": "Layer Breton", "rig_type": "Single Sail", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "spar_material": "wood", "year": 2019, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3422"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
