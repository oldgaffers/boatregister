They were towing her down to Cardiff with a vintage landrover when the landrover engine blew out on the M4 and &#39;Julietta&#39; finished the trip under tow from the AA.

Unfortunately the stern tube leaked and she was recovered onto the hard. She stayed there until mid&nbsp;2018 when it was noticed that the mast was rotten. The old mast was removed&nbsp;and&nbsp;a new aluminium mast was sourced and adapted. It was not stepped immediately as the owner decided to investigate converting &#39;Julietta&#39; to a gunter rig. This has been done to at least one other Atalanta&nbsp;to enable it&nbsp;to cruise the Netherlands canals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coventry Victor 8hp petrol engine was beyong repair and has been replaced with a 15hp Kabuta which has been&nbsp;marinised&nbsp;and adaptated&nbsp;to drive the variable prop gearbox.
