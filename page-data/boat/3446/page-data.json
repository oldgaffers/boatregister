Full production of Atalanta started in 1955 and about 200 were built, with profuction ceasing in the late 1960s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was discovered by her current owner and a friend in 2007 in a field in Cambridgeshire. They were towing her down to Cardiff with a vintage landrover when the landrover engine blew out on the M4 and &#39;Julietta&#39; finished the trip under tow from the AA. She was in a poor state, with holes in the deck and hull sue to&nbsp;a lot of rot, and delamination of the plywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The repair work took much longer than anticipated and was not completed until 2017, when &#39;Julietta&#39; was put in the water. Unfortunately the stern tube leaked and she was recovered onto the hard. She stayed there until mid&nbsp;2018 when it was noticed that the mast was rotten. The old mast was removed&nbsp;and&nbsp;a new aluminium mast was sourced and adapted. It was not stepped immediately as the owner decided to investigate converting &#39;Julietta&#39; to a gunter rig. This has been done to at least one other Atalanta&nbsp;to enable it&nbsp;to cruise the Netherlands canals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coventry Victor 8hp petrol engine was beyong repair and has been replaced with a 15hp Kabuta which has been&nbsp;marinised&nbsp;and adaptated&nbsp;to drive the variable prop gearbox.
