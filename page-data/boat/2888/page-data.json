So far (and who knows) Bonify has not been rigged as a ketch. Based on the Tahiti Ketch, John Hanna&#39;s design for the Carol in 1924 was for an ocean-worthy ketch. However, Bonify was built as a single masted gaff cutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was built near Colchester, taking over 13 years to complete, and then went to the west coast of Scotland with a new owner. By coincidence she is now kept in Ipswich only yards from where she was first launched. Her current owners have added a cockpit and doghouse. Her relatively shallow draft is very suitable for sailing on the East Coast of England and she regularly crosses the North Sea to Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 Bonify took part in the OGA Round Britain Challenge.
