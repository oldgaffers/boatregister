The article was an account by yachting author of \u201cTern\u201d\nfame, Claud Worth, of the maiden voyage of a small half decker he had had built\nfor single-handed day sailing. The designer was George Cozens, described by\nWorth as \u201c<em>the late Arthur Payne\u2019s draughtsman</em>\u201d and Worth comments that the\nplans are \u201c<em>the work of a master</em>\u201d. That first hull was \u201cSwift\u201d, built in Kent,\nand Worth ends his article: <em>\u201c\u2026she is perfectly suited to the purposes for which\nshe was built and, with a small well and well-arched cabin top, would make an\nadmirable little single-handed cruiser</em>\u201d.</p>\n<p>His advice was followed that same winter by Ernest L Woods (boat builder in\nHorning, Norfolk) who built My Quest for Mr H.J. Suffling and launched her in\nthe spring of 1930. Her name was Melody then, changed to Quest the following\nyear, and some years later to My Quest. She is of carvel construction, pitch\npine on steamed oak frames, with solid oak floors and a lead keel.</p>\n<p>H.J. Suffling kept Quest (as she then still was) until his death aged 75 in\n1948.</p>\n<p><strong>1949 to 1967</strong>Suffling\u2019s widow advertised the boat for sale the following year\nand she was purchased by Mr. William H Taylor from Derby. An old friend of\nTaylor\u2019s who sailed with him believes the price paid for the boat in 1949 was in\nthe region of \u00a3800. Mr.Taylor initially registered the boat with Lloyds as\n\u201cQuest\u201d (as Suffling had before him) but there may have been some issue with a\nduplication of names because the following year she had been renamed \u201cMy Quest\u201d.\nShe continued to be kept at the yard she\u2019d been built in at Horning in Norfolk\nbut was sailed to Oulton Broad in the summer.</p>\n<p>William Taylor sold the boat in 1967. The engine (2 cylinder Ailsa Craig) needed\nreplacing and he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without causing\nstructural damage.</p>\n<p><strong>1967 to 1969</strong>The new owner was Mr Terry Ward, living at that time in Norwich.\nMr Ward had admired My Quest for many years in Oulton Broad, and once he had\nacquired her, he successfully replaced the engine with an Albin built in 1965\n(no damage done!) Terry Ward sailed My Quest to Woodbridge where he kept her in\nthe Tidemill Marina for a couple of years until 1969 when Mr Taylor bought her\nback.</p>\n<p><strong>1969 to 1978</strong>William Taylor again! He had tried owning a newer Bermudan\nrigged boat but didn\u2019t keep it for long and clearly My Quest was his real love -\nalthough by the time he bought her back he was already over 80 years old. Photos\nand memories from his grandsons seem to indicate that he kept her on the Deben\nhereafter and he was 90 when he sold her again in 1978. At some point in that\ntime, as well as local cruising, he made a crossing to the Netherlands with a\nfamily member. Taylor\u2019s owning and maintaining the boat for a total of 27 years\nno doubt contributed significantly to her longevity.</p>\n<p><strong>1979 to 1983</strong>The next owner remains a mystery so far \u2013 his name was John D.\nParfitt and his address on the Lloyds Register is given as Sevenoaks in Kent. He\ngave his profession on the documents as \u201cdiamond mounter\u201d but he hasn\u2019t been\ntracked down yet. He moved My Quest to Heybridge Basin in Essex and she had\napparently not been lying there long when she was spotted by her next owner.\nIt\u2019s not known what use Parfitt had of the boat. The hull, having been cream in\ncolour when known in Norfolk and in Woodbridge, had by 1983 acquired the pale\nblue colour which she then kept for over 30 years.</p>\n<p><strong>1983 to 1984</strong>Mark Wakelin acquired her in 1983 but kept her for only one\nseason as he had a tough and discouraging solo experience on board which lead to\nhim putting the boat up for sale again.</p>\n<p><strong>1984 to 2014</strong> My Quest was lucky enough to be acquired next by Richard Gavin\nwho restored, maintained and sailed her for the next 30 years. She became a\nwell-known sight at East Coast OGA events where he sailed her skilfully and\nwithout any engine back-up (as he had removed the Albin in 1996). Richard\ncruised her extensively, visiting the Scilly Isles, Brest and Douarnenez, the\nChannel Islands and went as far north as Den Helder. Richard parted with her\nreluctantly in 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>2014 to 2018</strong>Nick Howells was next \u2013 he had My Quest lifted out at Woodbridge\nBoatyard (Eversons) where he repainted her pale blue hull a bright pea green and\ninstalled a Yanmar engine. Unfortunately Nick\u2019s circumstances changed and he was\nnever able to get My Quest launched. She stayed ashore for 4 years until\nacquired by her current owners.</p>\n<p><strong>2018 - present</strong>Howard Wheelton, Sue Lewis and Barry Edwards are joint owners.\nHer hull is cream in colour again. She attended Ostend at Anchor in 2019,\nrevisited her birthplace in the Norfolk Broads in 2020 and she regularly sails\nthe east coast rivers from her base in Harwich or from Walton-on-the-Naze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p>Yachting Monthly Aug 1929</p>\n<p>Eastern Daily Times 1930 and 1949</p>\n<p>Rex Woods, grandson of Ernest L Woods</p>\n<p>Grandsons and great grandson of William Taylor</p>\n<p>Mike Barnes \u00a0\u00a0Archivist, Norfolk Broads Yacht Club</p>\n<p>Les Gee, Maurice Ward (brother of Terry), Tony Webster</p>\n<p>Mark Wakelin</p>\n<p>Richard Gavin.</p>\n<p>Updated by Sue Lewis Jan 2023</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.3378, "draft": 1.2192, "fore_triangle_base": 3.9624481833699097, "fore_triangle_height": 6.583760058522312, "length_on_deck": 7.0104, "length_on_waterline": 6.4008778346744695, "length_over_all": 7.010485247500609, "main": {"foot": 4.724457449402585, "head": 3.3528407705437697, "luff": 4.26725188978298}, "sailarea": 34.65054505515055, "thcf": 0.903, "topsail": {"luff": 3.3528407705437697, "perpendicular": 1.6764203852718849}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Woodbridge", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "69d3c9eb-14f3-49d3-9329-eac1ce5a89a3", "image_key": "SKNVbt", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "My Quest", "oga_no": 894, "ownerships": [{"id": 1177, "member": 4118, "share": 32}, {"id": 423, "member": 4292, "share": 32}, {"end": 1947, "name": "H.J.Suffling", "share": 64, "start": 1930}, {"end": 1967, "name": "W.H.
