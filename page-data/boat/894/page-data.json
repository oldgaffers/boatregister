The article was an account by yachting author of “Tern” fame, Claud Worth, of the maiden voyage of a small half decker he had had built for single-handed day sailing. The designer was George Cozens, described by Worth as “<em>the late Arthur Payne’s draughtsman</em>” and Worth comments that the plans are “<em>the work of a master</em>”. That first hull was “Swift”, built in Kent, and Worth ends his article: <em>“…she is perfectly suited to the purposes for which she was built and, with a small well and well-arched cabin top, would make an admirable little single-handed cruiser</em>”.</p><p>His advice was followed that same winter by Ernest L Woods (boat builder in Horning, Norfolk) who built My Quest for Mr H.J. Suffling and launched her in the spring of 1930. Her name was Melody then, changed to Quest the following year, and some years later to My Quest. She is of carvel construction, pitch pine on steamed oak frames, with solid oak floors and a lead keel.</p><p>H.J. Suffling kept Quest (as she then still was) until his death aged 75 in 1948.</p><p><strong>1949 to 1967</strong>Suffling’s widow advertised the boat for sale the following year and she was purchased by Mr. William H Taylor from Derby. An old friend of Taylor’s who sailed with him believes the price paid for the boat in 1949 was in the region of £800. Mr.Taylor initially registered the boat with Lloyds as “Quest” (as Suffling had before him) but there may have been some issue with a duplication of names because the following year she had been renamed “My Quest”. She continued to be kept at the yard she’d been built in at Horning in Norfolk but was sailed to Oulton Broad in the summer.</p><p>William Taylor sold the boat in 1967. The engine (2 cylinder Ailsa Craig) needed replacing and he was afraid he wouldn’t be able to do this without causing structural damage.</p><p><strong>1967 to 1969</strong>The new owner was Mr Terry Ward, living at that time in Norwich. Mr Ward had admired My Quest for many years in Oulton Broad, and once he had acquired her, he successfully replaced the engine with an Albin built in 1965 (no damage done!) Terry Ward sailed My Quest to Woodbridge where he kept her in the Tidemill Marina for a couple of years until 1969 when Mr Taylor bought her back.</p><p><strong>1969 to 1978</strong>William Taylor again! He had tried owning a newer Bermudan rigged boat but didn’t keep it for long and clearly My Quest was his real love - although by the time he bought her back he was already over 80 years old. Photos and memories from his grandsons seem to indicate that he kept her on the Deben hereafter and he was 90 when he sold her again in 1978. At some point in that time, as well as local cruising, he made a crossing to the Netherlands with a family member. Taylor’s owning and maintaining the boat for a total of 27 years no doubt contributed significantly to her longevity.</p><p><strong>1979 to 1983</strong>The next owner remains a mystery so far – his name was John D. Parfitt and his address on the Lloyds Register is given as Sevenoaks in Kent. He gave his profession on the documents as “diamond mounter” but he hasn’t been tracked down yet. He moved My Quest to Heybridge Basin in Essex and she had apparently not been lying there long when she was spotted by her next owner. It’s not known what use Parfitt had of the boat. The hull, having been cream in colour when known in Norfolk and in Woodbridge, had by 1983 acquired the pale blue colour which she then kept for over 30 years.</p><p><strong>1983 to 1984</strong>Mark Wakelin acquired her in 1983 but kept her for only one season as he had a tough and discouraging solo experience on board which lead to him putting the boat up for sale again.</p><p><strong>1984 to 2014 </strong>My Quest was lucky enough to be acquired next by Richard Gavin who restored, maintained and sailed her for the next 30 years. She became a well-known sight at East Coast OGA events where he sailed her skilfully and without any engine back-up (as he had removed the Albin in 1996). Richard cruised her extensively, visiting the Scilly Isles, Brest and Douarnenez, the Channel Islands and went as far north as Den Helder. Richard parted with her reluctantly in 2014.</p><p><strong>2014 to 2018</strong>Nick Howells was next – he had My Quest lifted out at Woodbridge Boatyard (Eversons) where he repainted her pale blue hull a bright pea green and installed a Yanmar engine. Unfortunately Nick’s circumstances changed and he was never able to get My Quest launched. She stayed ashore for 4 years until acquired by her current owners.</p><p><strong>2018 - present</strong>Howard Wheelton, Sue Lewis and Barry Edwards are joint owners. Her hull is cream in colour again, she attended Ostend at Anchor in 2019 and she should be seen sailing east coast waters again once Covid allows.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Yachting Monthly Aug 1929</p><p>Eastern Daily Times 1930 and 1949</p><p>Rex Woods, grandson of Ernest L Woods</p><p>Grandsons and great grandson of William Taylor</p><p>Les Gee, Maurice Ward (brother of Terry), Tony Webster</p><p>Mike Barnes&nbsp; &nbsp;Archivist, Norfolk Broads Yacht Club</p><p>Mark Wakelin</p><p>Richard Gavin.</p><p>from Sue Lewis Jan 2021</p>","image_key":"SKNVbt","uk_part1":"185678","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"Carvel  Pensacola pitch pine on steamed oak frames","draft":1.2192,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.346988539380639,"main":{"foot":4.724457449402585,"head":3.3528407705437697,"luff":4.26725188978298},"thcf":0.903,"draft":1.21921482565228,"topsail":{"luff":3.3528407705437697,"perpendicular":1.6764203852718849},"sailarea":34.65054505515055,"length_over_all":7.010485247500609,"fore_triangle_base":3.9624481833699097,"length_on_waterline":6.4008778346744695,"fore_triangle_height":6.583760058522312},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.0104,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>1930s 23ft gaff cutter built by Ernest Woods at Horning, Norfolk.
