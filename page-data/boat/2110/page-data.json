Managed to find a brand new unused Blake\u2019s Baby loo on eBay . It took 1 1/2 days to fit including new pipes. Also need to fit the new Blake\u2019s sea cocks when ashore.\nAs it\u2019s cold aboard a new Eberspacher heater was next.\nThe engine has been the most problematic item so far to fix. As Rosie wasn\u2019t use for 18 years condensation inside the engine caused all the valve seats to corrode and lessen the compression ratios. So a full cylinder head rebuild later and I think it should be ok.havent had the time yet to do a proper sea trial. Have to wait until the new year now.\nBought new Chartplotter and have to fix it in place. Thinking of using a TV swinging mount attached to the access door frame as it\u2019s a large 12\u201d screen.\nNeed to fit an AIS transponder but will wait a couple of months hoping technology moved on as would like it integrated into the VHF radio with Splitter, GPS,AIS transponder,NMEA 2000. At the moment it doesn\u2019t exist.\nJobs to do.\nMake the bowsprit swivel.\nMaybe lead lines aft into cockpit\nFit fresh water tank and pipes \nFeathering prop</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.8956, "draft": 1.143, "fore_triangle_base": 5.7912704218483295, "fore_triangle_height": 8.458302852962692, "length_on_deck": 9.144, "length_on_waterline": 7.848695440136551, "length_over_all": 9.1441111923921, "main": {"foot": 5.6388685686417945, "head": 4.495854669592782, "luff": 4.953060229212387}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.969236092, "topsail": {"luff": 5.715069495245062, "perpendicular": 2.286027798098025}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Titchmarsh Marina", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "1cc46971-e888-4fbd-b8eb-035bdda40ded", "image_key": "vQc3NS", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Rosie", "oga_no": 2110, "ownerships": [{"end": 2017, "name": "Ingram Murray", "share": 64, "start": 1997}, {"end": 2018, "name": "Leatham Emma and Kevin", "share": 64, "start": 2017}, {"name": "Geoffrey Willerton", "share": 64, "start": 2018}], "place_built": "Rock", "previous_names": ["Rosie G"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "P33", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Rosie, ex Rosie G is a Cornish Crabbers Pilot Cutter built in 1990.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-cNPNHMQ/0/Th/i-cNPNHMQ-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1990, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2110"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
