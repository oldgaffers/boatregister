Managed to find a brand new unused Blake’s Baby loo on eBay . It took 1 1/2 days to fit including new pipes. Also need to fit the new Blake’s sea cocks when ashore.\r\nAs it’s cold aboard a new Eberspacher heater was next.\r\nThe engine has been the most problematic item so far to fix. As Rosie wasn’t use for 18 years condensation inside the engine caused all the valve seats to corrode and lessen the compression ratios. So a full cylinder head rebuild later and I think it should be ok.havent had the time yet to do a proper sea trial. Have to wait until the new year now.\r\nBought new Chartplotter and have to fix it in place. Thinking of using a TV swinging mount attached to the access door frame as it’s a large 12” screen.\r\nNeed to fit an AIS transponder but will wait a couple of months hoping technology moved on as would like it integrated into the VHF radio with Splitter, GPS,AIS transponder,NMEA 2000. At the moment it doesn’t exist.\r\nJobs to do.\r\nMake the bowsprit swivel.\r\nMaybe lead lines aft into cockpit\r\nFit fresh water tank and pipes \r\nFeathering prop","image_key":"vQc3NS","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":"GRP, sitka Spruce spars","draft":1.143,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"main":{"foot":5.6388685686417945,"head":4.495854669592782,"luff":4.953060229212387},"thcf":0.969236092,"draft":1.1430138990490124,"topsail":{"luff":5.715069495245062,"perpendicular":2.286027798098025},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":9.1441111923921,"fore_triangle_base":5.7912704218483295,"length_on_waterline":7.848695440136551,"fore_triangle_height":8.458302852962692},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.144,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Rosie, ex Rosie G is a Cornish Crabbers Pilot Cutter built in 1990.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:39:29.632905+00:00","website":"","beam":2.8956,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"2bdd8cf6-ba06-4a2b-9894-d7e26c6261ad","designer":"af6f6943-2024-44d5-af5e-a6e63fc66db5","design_class":"5bfb6ea5-ee56-40f5-bc71-ed0d31fbee8e","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"cold_moulded"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Cornish Crabber Pilot Cutter 30"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Roger Dongray"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Cornish Crabbers Ltd."},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
