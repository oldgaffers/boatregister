Following a brief service history that included minesweeping, she was set to fishing in the Thames approaches when hostilities ceased.  \n\n<div>Originally based in Leigh on Sea she moved to Southwold in 1993 and fished from there, also being used to rebuild the stages on the river Blyth. The method was to maneuver steel drilling rods into place in a vertical position then sink them into the mud by hauling up the weight of Alphaâ€™s stern using her net winch! This is how many of the local stages became pontoons. Although the new structures extended further into the river, they afforded safer conditions for both boats and owners. All was well until the Alpha needed a refit. Her planking was getting pretty tired, not least because of the owner's unconventional method of pile driving.</div>\n\n<div>Lacking money for the boatyard repairs the Alpha was re-launched (leaking) without a deck house and without even covering boards for the deck! She got as far as the River Deben, where she sat on a mud berth before eventually springing a plank and sinking.  \n</div>\n\n<div>In 2020 she was lying on a horse shoal, a little downstream from Melton road-bridge, kept afloat at high tide by large plastic containers inside her.  \n</div>","image_key":"RxpkKH","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Other","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":null,"draft":null,"generic_type":null,"handicap_data":null,"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":null,"mainsail_type":"other","short_description":"Alpha was built for fishing under engine, but her lines are those os a traditional sailing bawley","updated_at":"2021-03-26T07:21:36.23622+00:00","website":null,"beam":null,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":null,"designer":null,"design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":null,"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Other"},"genericTypeByGenericType":null,"builderByBuilder":null,"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
