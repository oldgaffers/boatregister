Built in 1930 in Bilboa at the yard of Hermano Sagredo by men transported over specially from Morgan Giles in England. She is constructed of Mahogany &nbsp;on steamed oak frames. She was smuggled out of Spain as deck cargo to Maldon during the Spanish Civil War, and renamed <em>Saxon</em> in 1934. Originally sporting 3 open cockpits for crew, over the years the rig was altered and a large cabin built for family cruising by various owners. Under the name of <em>Saxon</em> she sailed at Burnham and with the Maldon Little Ship club.</p>\n<p><em>Saxon</em> was acquired in 1984 by Hartley and Brookes Boat Designs of Heybridge Basin, Maldon. They restored her original name, gutted the hull and removed the rig. A new rig and deck layout was designed by Colin Brookes with the work being carried out by Peter Brookes through the winter of 1984-5.</p>\n<p>She was sold out of the OGA in 2003.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"length_on_waterline": 7.071445988783223}, "home_port": "", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "001ee747-8a68-4fb0-8a44-a577d86a0dbd", "image_key": "FVBvKj", "length_on_deck": 10.5156, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "mssi": "", "name": "Asti V", "nhsr": "", "nsbr": "", "oga_no": 2006, "ownerships": [{"name": "Perkins R M", "share": 64, "start": 2012}], "place_built": "Bilbao", "previous_names": ["Saxon"], "reference": ["Log 86/4", "Log Sep 97", "CB Jul/Aug 88", "CB Sep 2003"], "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "", "short_description": "<p>Built for the 1932 Olympics</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "ssr": "", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-tGpLG7q/0/Th/i-tGpLG7q-Th.jpg", "uk_part1": "", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "website": "", "year": 1930, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2006"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
