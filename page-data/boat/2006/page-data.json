Built in 1930 in Bilboa at the yard of Hermano Sagredo by men transported over specially from Morgan Giles in England. She is constructed of Mahogany &nbsp;on steamed oak frames. She was smuggled out of Spain as deck cargo to Maldon during the Spanish Civil War, and renamed <em>Saxon</em> in 1934. Originally sporting 3 open cockpits for crew, over the years the rig was altered and a large cabin built for family cruising by various owners. Under the name of <em>Saxon</em> she sailed at Burnham and with the Maldon Little Ship club.</p>\n<p><em>Saxon</em> was acquired in 1984 by Hartley and Brookes Boat Designs of Heybridge Basin, Maldon. They restored her original name, gutted the hull and removed the rig. A new rig and deck layout was designed by Colin Brookes with the work being carried out by Peter Brookes through the winter of 1984-5.</p>\n<p>She was sold out of the OGA in 2003.</p>","image_key":null,"uk_part1":"","spar_material":"aluminium","rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"Carvel Mahogany on steamed Oak frames","draft":1.8288,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":"{\"beam\":1.889782979761034,\"draft\":1.8288222384784198,\"length_over_all\":10.515727871250913,\"length_on_waterline\":7.071445988783223}","hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.5156,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Built for the 1932 Olympics</p>","updated_at":"2021-02-12T20:53:17.713542+00:00","website":"","beam":1.8898,"air_draft":null,"reference":"[\"Log 86/4\",\"Log Sep 97\",\"CB Jul/Aug 88\",\"CB Sep 2003\"]","builder":"5ea9c203-7c9d-426e-8a63-e1e73304491b","designer":"f1bc585c-9638-4fd8-8fc7-f382b028513c","design_class":"70d8ab47-0b98-4c96-a4b9-1fd715c0d3fb","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"6 Metre"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Morgan Giles"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Sloop"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"unknown"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Hermano Sagredo/Mor Gils","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
