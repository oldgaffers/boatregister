Jonathan bought her from Tim in August 2014. She had some repairs to the planking, a new engine, some pretty poor interior fitting out, the rig has been restored, she has a new rudder, new deck and a reconditioned Baby Blake toilet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014 she was moved into Jonathan&#39;s orchard where he hopes to complete the work.
