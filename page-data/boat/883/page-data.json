H. Jessop.  Details of the first registration show that she had 850 sq, ft. of sail and had a Riley 4 cylinder petrol engine fitted.  Unfortunately nothing is known about her pre 1928 history.  From 1944 to 1969 she belonged to a B. M. W. Burnell who in 1949 changed the engine for a Thornycroft Handibilly 2 cylinder petrol/paraffin.  In 1953 her rig was shortened to 500 sq. ft of sail.  During 1960's she was owned by a Roger D. Wakefield, who sold her to a W. Rayner of Leeds, at about this time the present Turner 28 hp diesel engine was fitted.  Prior to the 1960's she seems to have owners in the Nottingham shire area and to have been kept in the Hull area.  In 1976 Ed Wheeler of Croydon bought her, and bought her down to Canvey Island, where bought in October 1978.  The registration has not been kept up since 1953.
