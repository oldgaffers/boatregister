After the first World War she was sold again, had her first engine installed in 1920, and relocated to Burnham, and later West Mersea where she was found and bought by Maurice Griffiths, who re-named her Storm.&nbsp; She was owned twice by Maurice Griffiths, past editor of Yachting Monthly, and he describes her in his books, in particular &#39;Magic of the Swatchways&#39;. In &#39;Dream Boats&#39; he describes her as &#39;My little 7 tonner Storm was built as a miniature bawley yacht, but with somewhat finer lines, and I always regarded her as one of the most endearing little craft I have ever owned.&#39; He had to sell her and vowed he&#39;d buy her back which he did six years later.&nbsp; The owner between 1924 and 1930 when MG bought her back, was a Mr Eustace Mason, who founded the Claygate Cement works.&nbsp; MG sold her again in 1931, and she was re-located to Poole, to take part in races organised by the Parkstone Sailing Club.&nbsp; The owner then was a Col J M Hulton, a veteran of the Boer Wars, the First World War, and the Irish troubles in the 1920&#39;s.&nbsp; There are records of her not doing too well in the 1935&nbsp;round the island (IOW) race.&nbsp; Storm drops out of the Lloyds Registers in 1937, and the next record I have found was the hand written receipt included in her paperwork, when the then owner John Derrick of Fareham sold her to David Cade in 1962.&nbsp; John Derrick appears to have been an actor in the Portsmouth area, but the record is cold between 1937 and 1962 - I would love to find out where she was in those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David J Cade passed away on 17 July 2002, when serving as OGA President having owned Storm from 1962. Badly damaged in a northerly storm after the 1975 Solent Race in Cowes it took David Cade 18 years to rebuild her.
