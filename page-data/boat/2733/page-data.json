Tablo Pitt and his sons Charlie\nand Reg replaced the steam engine by a three cylinder Lister diesel engine and\ntoday it has a four cylinder diesel Mercedes 615.</p>\n<p>\u2018Her name was something of an anomaly as she was actually the largest vessel to\nbe worked from Maldon at that time. [1946]. The catch of shrimp had to be cooked\non board and then laid out in trays to dry, so the vast expanse of deck was\ninvaluable\u2019. From; \u2018Blackwater Men\u2019, by A. and M. Emmett. 1992, Seax Book,\nElsenham, Bishop\u2019s Stortford.</p>\n<p>Previous owners registered;\nSmith Bros. Burnham-on-Crouch, 1904.\nSmith Bros. Burnham-on-Crouch Ltd. Burnham, Essex. 1907.\nA.H.

The owners had taken the ship 25 years\npreviously from the UK to Holland.</p>\n<p>It took me 10 years to rebuild the ship. It was launched in Spakenburg in 2005.\nIt is currently recognised as a sailing monument.</p>\n<p>She lies in Huizenharbour in the Netherlands and has been used for recreational\nand charter purposes. Because of health problems I\u2019m looking for a buyer and I\nwould love it if the Tiny Mite would return to the U.K. to be sailed again.</p>", "generic_type": "Paglesham Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.438, "draft": 1.372, "length_on_deck": 14.1, "length_on_waterline": 8.534, "length_over_all": 14.1}, "home_port": "Bunschoten, Nl", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "32b86e0c-fae2-4e9a-bcd1-5a007a07fb36", "image_key": "j3wXVN", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Tiny Mite", "oga_no": 2733, "ownerships": [{"name": "Arend Liefkes", "share": 64, "start": 2012}], "place_built": "Paglesham", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2024-10-18", "year": 1904, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2733"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
