Lady Priestley donated the money in memory of her husband, a Bradford mill owner, MP and supporter of the RNLI. Sir William had been involved in fundraising for the Spurn Head lifeboat &#39;City of Bradford II&#39;. Morecambe was popular with holidaymakers from Bradford and was often known as &#39;Bradford by the Sea&#39;.&nbsp;The naming of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; was attended by the Lord Mayors of Bradford and Leeds and she was paraded through the streets of Morecambe and Heysham watched by 20,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six or more replicas have been made of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; in glass fibre using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric Bergqvist, a Cheshire boatbuilder in return for royalties of &pound;25 for every boat built. The &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; was retired from service in 1987 and taken to Lancaster Maritime Museum to await restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Alasdair Simpson, Arnside Sailing Club, September 2018</h4>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Built and fitted out by Classic Yachts of Southampton who purchased Eric Bergqvist&#39;s original &#39;Freda&#39; and another of the hulls from the mould he had made, &#39;Freda&#39; was exibited at the 1989 Southampton Boat Show to much acclaim. She was also displayed at the Lancaster Maritime Museum for some time. The class is named after Eric Bergqvist&#39;s wife, Freda but no further boats were built.</p>","image_key":"FNqPcR","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-L2RtTtR/0/Th/i-L2RtTtR-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":"GRP","draft":1.0424,"generic_type":"Morecambe Bay Prawner","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"main":{"foot":4.471470373079736,"head":3.7003169958546698,"luff":4.13923433308949},"thcf":0.894971381,"draft":1.066812972445745,"topsail":{"luff":4.693977078761278,"perpendicular":2.286027798098025},"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":8.382101926359423,"fore_triangle_base":4.57205559619605,"length_on_waterline":7.162887100707144,"fore_triangle_height":4.2611558156547185},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.3302,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>&#39;Freda&#39; was moulded from the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; the Morecambe Bay Prawner Association lifeboat.</p>","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00","website":"","beam":2.7432,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"9bfa5fa1-4c94-4793-b980-b1a8ad4c01d3","designer":"da4baa22-674e-4ea8-b2c5-14aee7286837","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"cold_moulded"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"William Crossfield"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Morecambe Bay Prawner"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Classic Yachts"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
