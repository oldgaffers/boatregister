Lady Priestley donated the money in memory of\nher husband, a Bradford mill owner, MP and supporter of the RNLI. Sir William\nhad been involved in fundraising for the Spurn Head lifeboat 'City of Bradford\nII'. Morecambe was popular with holidaymakers from Bradford and was often known\nas 'Bradford by the Sea'.\u00a0The naming of the 'Sir William Priestley' was attended\nby the Lord Mayors of Bradford and Leeds and she was paraded through the streets\nof Morecambe and Heysham watched by 20,000 people.</p>\n<p>Six or more replicas have been made of the 'Sir William Priestley' in glass\nfibre using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric Bergqvist, a Cheshire\nboatbuilder in return for royalties of \u00a325 for every boat built. The 'Sir\nWilliam Priestley' was retired from service in 1987 and taken to Lancaster\nMaritime Museum to await restoration.</p>\n<h4>Alasdair Simpson, Arnside Sailing Club, September 2018</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Built and fitted out by Classic Yachts of Southampton who purchased Eric\nBergqvist's original 'Freda' and another of the hulls from the mould he had\nmade, 'Freda' was exibited at the 1989 Southampton Boat Show to much acclaim.\nShe was also displayed at the Lancaster Maritime Museum for some time.
