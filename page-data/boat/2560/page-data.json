Re-named Treue (Fidelity) in 1874 by her new owner G J Matzen, she became a &#39;Austerntransport&#39; (cargo vessel) before being sold to a Danish owner. Once more re-named, Manna, she was used as a &#39;Frachtschiff&#39; (cargo ship) for many years. Following several changes of ownership, she was converted in 1917, under the new name Rigmor, to a &#39;Steinfischer&#39; (stone fisher).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1980s, having been sold as a leisure sailing craft when she was no longer viable for dredging, Rigmor began to deteriorate. A group was established to buy and restore the ship, returning her to Gluckstadt in 1992.
