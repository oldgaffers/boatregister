Mackenrot, who lived at Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex &#39;Papillon&#39; was commissioned for Operation Dynamo. She arrived for service at Dover on 30 May 1940 ready to go to Dunkirk, but her two 4 cylinder Morris petrol engines were &#39;defective&#39;. It was noted that she had 30 gallons of petrol, a full crew and a minor electrical fault. A fault with her condenser was repaired. She was then loaded with six spare tins of petrol and water. There was a minor hiccup in that her civilian crew consisting of Skipper E. Sommers Holmwood of Kingston by Sea, S.J Downes of Shoreham, B.Hawood of Brighton and Mr Griffiths of Peacehaven were uncertain of their conditions of service. &#39;Papillon&#39; eventually sailed for Dunkirk on 2 June and when she came back the next day, gave up her route order and had her fuel and oil tanks replenished.</p><p>1940 - 1941 Remained in Service with The Admiralty and provided local coastal and river patrols.</p><p>1941 - 1943 Laid up</p><p>1943 - 1945 Used for Fire Service duties until the end of the War</p><p>1951 Owned by Mr Stanley Howard of Ipswich</p><p>1988 Purchased in 1988 by Mr Richard Huggett of Erith Kent. &#39;Papillon&#39; was in a poor state of repair.
