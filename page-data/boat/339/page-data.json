She is &#39;Henrietta&#39;, a ship&#39;s lifeboat from the ship &#39;Trader II&#39;, built at Boom in Holland, and converted to a sailing boat with leeboards by Phil Dan of Wivenhoe.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Phil entered her in the 1963 East Coast Old Gaffers Race, and was one of the keen founder members of the OGA. The lack of wind in 1963 forced her to retire, and again in 1964 the light winds were not to her liking - but Phil determined to show off &#39;Henrietta&#39;s capabilities, and in the 1965 Race he got his chance and &#39;Henrietta&#39; finished 22nd out of 40 - an excellent performance when one remembers that the T(H)CF handicapping system does not favour extreme shoal draft types.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Having shown that her racing performance in a resaonable breeze could be fairly matched against average Old Gaffers, Phil proceeded to repeat the performance in 1966, finishing 29th out of 49. 1967 saw an improvement to 27th out of 56, but 1968 brought light winds again, and &#39;Henrietta&#39; retired. 1969 saw &#39;Henrietta&#39; placed 58th out of 84, to win the newly donated Dulcibella Shield for the first converted lifeboat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Phil Dan sold &#39;Henrietta&#39; after the 1969 Race, and unfortunately her new owner was not interested in Old Gaffers Races so her racing career lasted seven seasons, with three retirements and four very creditable placings.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>At 24.5&#39; LOA, &#39;Henrietta&#39; is a bit smaller than most converted lifeboats, but the conversion resulted in a useful small cruising boat without the excessive tophamper one sometimes sees on conversions.</blockquote>","image_key":"RnT57N","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":null,"draft":1.2192,"generic_type":"Lifeboat","handicap_data":null,"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.4676,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Henrietta&#39; is the type of boat in the founders&#39; minds of the OGA.
