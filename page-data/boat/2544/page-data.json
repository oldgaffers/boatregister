Believed to be built around 1910 by Crossfields, Arnside, she worked out of Mayport with fishing no. MT13.</p><p>Her fit has been maintained by current owners for extended cruising. All her sails, standing rigging, and running rigging have been renewed. Apart from her cruising rig other sails include lightweight racing jib and staysail, topsail and various reaching foresails. All the sails and rigging are in good or excellent condition. Her spars and hull are in very good condition, her bowsprit was replaced with one in laminated spruce in about 2005. Her engine is really excellent: a Nanni 4-43HD; 4 cylinder 2.2 litre engine with water cooled gearbox, and Brunton 18\" self-adjusting three bladed propeller; all new and installed in 2013, and has had little use. 120 litres capacity of diesel. 60 litres of fresh water. Jabsco toilet about 5years old. Nelson cooker, gimbled with two burners plus grill and oven, VHF radio and Garmin plotter were new for the 2013 trip. She has a Reflexs diesel cabin heater. Lewmar winches, fenders and two bilge pumps.</p><p>For the 2013 Round Britain Challenge, we fitted a cockpit cuddy and stern railing but this is easily removed if so desired. Peggy is a powerful and fast passage maker, yet&nbsp;&nbsp;can be sailed quite easily by two people. We are open to fair offers</p>", "seller_gold_id": null, "seller_member": null, "sold": null, "summary": null, "updated_at": "2020-05-03T10:13:13.127106+00:00"}], "full_description": "<p>Phil and Rose-Marie Newman purchased &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo; in 1999 and found her to be a fast and capable boat; achieving good passage times as well as being stable and comfortable in a seaway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their early years of ownership they enjoyed some success in East Coast OGA races, more recently enjoying cruising both sides of the English Channel with family.

As is often the case with older boats she took a while to sell and when she was eventually bought it was to remove her engine and ballast for salvage. Fortunately her plight came to the attention of Eric&nbsp;Crossfield, the builder&#39;s grandson. He bought her and she was towed round to the Woodbridge Boat Yard where she awaits restoration.</p>", "generic_type": "Morecambe Bay Prawner", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.3528, "draft": 1.4722, "fore_triangle_base": 6.739209948792976, "fore_triangle_height": 10.028041940990002, "length_on_deck": 10.9728, "length_on_waterline": 9.692757863935626, "length_over_all": 10.972933430870519, "main": {"foot": 5.9436722750548645, "head": 4.511094854913436, "luff": 5.425505974152646}, "topsail": {"luff": 6.431358205315777, "perpendicular": 3.0480370641306997}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Woodbridge", "id": "8353e9c9-7ec8-4645-9b83-b4a4edcdf435", "image_key": "5fwC3H", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Peggy", "oga_no": 2544, "ownerships": [{"end": 2018, "name": "Philip Newman", "share": 64, "start": 1999}, {"current": true, "id": 808, "member": 5868, "share": 64, "start": 2019}], "place_built": "Arnside", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>&#39;Peggy&#39; is an ex working prawning boat, believed to have been built about 1910 by Crossfields at Arnside,&nbsp; Morcambe Bay.
