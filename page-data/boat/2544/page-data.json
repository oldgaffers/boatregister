All her sails, standing rigging, and running rigging have been renewed. Apart from her cruising rig other sails include lightweight racing jib and staysail, topsail and various reaching foresails. All the sails and rigging are in good or excellent condition. Her spars and hull are in very good condition, her bowsprit was replaced with one in laminated spruce in about 2005. Her engine is really excellent: a Nanni 4-43HD; 4 cylinder 2.2 litre engine with water cooled gearbox, and Brunton 18\" self-adjusting three bladed propeller; all new and installed in 2013, and has had little use. 120 litres capacity of diesel. 60 litres of fresh water. Jabsco toilet about 5years old. Nelson cooker, gimbled with two burners plus grill and oven, VHF radio and Garmin plotter were new for the 2013 trip. She has a Reflexs diesel cabin heater. Lewmar winches, fenders and two bilge pumps.</p><p>For the 2013 Round Britain Challenge, we fitted a cockpit cuddy and stern railing but this is easily removed if so desired. Peggy is a powerful and fast passage maker, yet&nbsp;&nbsp;can be sailed quite easily by two people.
