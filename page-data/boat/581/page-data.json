She remained in the Mersey area until 1905, when she changed hands and moved to Burnham on Crouch. The following year she was sold to Army captains stationed at Fort Albert in Alderney, and was kept in Braye Harbour for three years. She then spent three further years in Portsmouth until 1912 until being bought by&nbsp;two new owners who kept her at Burnham. In 1914 she was sold to John A. Denny and during the first world war her lead keel was removed to make bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the wars &#39;Undine&#39; lay on the shore at West Mersea, used as a houseboat, with windows cut into her topsides and a henhouse on deck. It was in this sorry state that two young engineers from Ipswich found her and decided to get her sailing again. They bought her for &pound;12, had her towed to the Orwell Yacht Club at Ipswich, then spent several years rebuilding her, interrupted for a while by the second world war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They replaced the lost lead keel with a cast iron one, rebuilt the decks, superstructure, interior and did major repairs to the hull. They replaced the gaff rig with a Bermudan; the fashion of the day. They gave her a very tall heavy mast that had already seen service in a big fishing smack. They retained the bowsprit and cutter rig providing a total sail area of 580 sq. ft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war &#39;Undine&#39; was seen sailing once more after 20 years out of commission. She made a fine sight in the local club races out of the Orwell and was known for her habit of &#39;laying over&#39; in a breeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1956 she was sold to A.W.F. Hunt and K Cocksedge, who continued to keep her at Ipswich, using her for family cruising. They sold her in 1962 to the rather improbably sounding Polish Yacht Club of Great Britain, and she was kept in Gravesend and Walton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1967 Nick and Chris Temple found her in a mud berth opposite the Walton and Frinton Yacht Club in a fairly derelict state and decided to take her over and put her back in commission. They had often seen her sailing on the Stour when she was under the ownership of Ken Cocksedge, and had always thought her to be a beautiful boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They took her round to Wrabness and had her on the beach for several weeks before getting her sailing later in the season. They kept her at Wrabness and greatly enjoyed the attention she received around the local rivers. Longshoremen in dinghies would drop their oars and gaze in disbelief, muttering &quot;Well, if &#39;at in&#39;t the old Un-dine. I never knew she war still afloot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1971 she was given a major refit, which involved building a cradle and slipway on the beach at Wrabness to haul her above the high water mark. The Bermudan mast was condemned because of extensive rot and they decided to change back to gaff rig whilst they were about it. A reasonably straight larch tree was found at a local timber yard, rescued in the nick of time from being turned into larch lap fencing. It was shaped into a quite presentable pole mast in a few days, and the boom was lenghtened by 2&#39;. The spreaders and the lower standing rigging from the Bermudan rig were re-used to save making up a new set. A gaff mainasil from a pre-war Broards cruiser was convenietly to hand and re-cut to fit the new rig with a good coat of tan dressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new rig was delightfully simple and very much lighter than the complicated Bermudan/Marconi set up with diamond stays, jumper struts and a standing backstay. The sail area was kept to 580 sq.ft. and 60 sq. ft. of this was in the form of a jib headed topsail. The mast was 10&#39; shorter so there was less weight aloft despite the addition of a 15&#39; larch gaff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Undine&#39; performed better under her original rig, heeling less, and pointing just as high with added speed off the wind. Admittedly the long boom could touch the water on a reach in brisk weather with a sea running, but generally the boat became much easier to manage, and was very snug with a couple of reefs tied down and the jib taken off. The further advantage was &#39;Undine&#39; was now eligible to join in the East Coast Gaffers events and she took part in 1971 and 1972 races. Chris and Nick offended some of the more sober members by showing off Undine&#39;s windward performance in luffing matches, something quite unheard of in those days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Undine&#39; cruised to the Solent in 1971 and Chris spent that winter living aboard whilst moored on the Itchen. The Tortoise stove in the saloon was very highly valued during those months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the autumn of 1982 Chris and Nick very reluctantly decided to sell &#39;Undine&#39; because of other committments. She went to Bristol where she lay at Pill. The new owner remedied a certain looseness of the counter by putting a saw through it about 2&#39; from the stern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on a few years, &#39;Undine&#39; had been lying at Downs Road Boatyard, Maldon, Essex and the yard wanted to dispose of her so Nick Temple bought her back in 2018 and is moving her to his mill in Suffolk.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.3774, "draft": 1.6764, "length_on_deck": 9.7536, "length_on_waterline": 8.382101926359423, "length_over_all": 9.75371860521824}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Suffolk", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "2dff0d66-88ab-4cdc-a319-bbd382dccc2b", "image_key": "ZRtKwC", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Undine", "oga_no": 581, "ownerships": [{"end": 1905, "name": "J.H.Cousins", "share": 64, "start": 1889}, {"note": "Arnold Hood and Harry Tricker Late 1930's to 1956", "start": 1930, "text": "Arnold Hood and Harry Tricker Late"}, {"end": 1962, "name": "A.W.F.
