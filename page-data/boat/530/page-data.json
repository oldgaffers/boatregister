The following article is taken from that issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The first picture we have been able to publish of a gaffer carrying her OGA Race number on her sail &lsquo;Wilful&rsquo; was designed and built by C. Sibbick of Cowes in 1899, and was formerly named &lsquo;Norken&rsquo;, then &lsquo;Melody&rsquo;. In 1911 she moved to the East Coast, where she stayed until 1975. In 1928, she was owned by Maurice Griffiths, who described he in some of his books.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Mike Willett brought her into the OGA fleet when he bought her in 1971. Mike added the coachroof, and replaced the small steering well described by Maurice Griffiths with the larger cockpit. In 1975, Mike sold &lsquo;Wilful&rsquo; to Johathan Ward-Hayne, who took her round to join the newly-formed South Western fleet.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The stem is slightly rounded above the water, and fairly well cut away below. While she is pretty lean bowed, there is sufficient flare to prevent her digging in until conditions get really severe, but she has a very lively pitching motion which I am trying to smooth out by spreading the ballast more. As can be imagined from the amount of ballast she is as stiff as a church, for an 8 tonner, that is.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The saloon contains two settee berths and most important, the coal stove. The galley is just abaft the mast, sink to port and gas cooker&#39; to starboard. There is a well placed skylight giving headroom there. Forward of the mast is the head and two pipe cots. The saloon is all varnished, and with all the frames visible is pleasantly old fashioned, while the foc&#39;sle is white painted for light, and to encourage cleanliness.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Plans for the future include replacing the wire main halliards which run on very inefficient winches with rope pulley-hauley ones, and having a squaresail made for downwind cruising, as I hate spinnakers.</blockquote>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.6213118751524016, "draft": 1.798341867837113, "length_on_waterline": 8.53450377956596, "length_over_all": 9.1441111923921}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "", "hull_form": "unknown", "id": "ed4eb50f-df4a-45bd-bd86-1a66f6880a23", "image_key": "dtKmGr", "length_on_deck": 9.144, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Wilful", "oga_no": 530, "place_built": "Cowes IoW", "previous_names": ["Melody", "Norken"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "short_description": "<p>Designed and built by C Sibbick of Cowes, 1899, &#39;Wilful&#39; was once owned by Maurice Griffiths.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-DV5Bwfp/0/Th/i-DV5Bwfp-Th.jpg", "uk_part1": "127530", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "website": "", "year": 1899, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/530"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
