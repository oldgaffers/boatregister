The result was <em>Rawanah</em>, built by Harry King at Pin Mill, perhaps inspired by <em>Awara</em> also built there in 1932.</p>\n<p><em>Rawanah</em> &nbsp;was registered in &nbsp;Ipswich to Hubert Arnold Brown, a good friend of Maurice Griffiths, &nbsp;who had commissioned the build, and then the vessel passed to the Jersey Register on 3 November 1950 when she was bought by the Hollick brothers &nbsp;at St Lawrence, Jersey.</p>\n<p>She features in Maurice Griffiths' book &nbsp;'Little Ships &amp; Shoal Waters' recounting a voyage he made, together &nbsp;with Hubert Brown, from Oban to East Tarbert. The book also contains &nbsp;line drawings and sail plan.&nbsp; She was in the ownership of one family for &nbsp;42 years.</p>\n<p>Between 2005&nbsp;and 2015, <em>Rawanah</em> sailed thousands of &nbsp;miles to the Outer and Inner Hebrides, Orkney and Faroe Isles, Scilly &nbsp;Isles, and Ireland three times including a circumnavigation in July 2008. &nbsp;She won the 'Cock o' the Bristol Channel Race' with courses of 80 and 50 &nbsp;miles competing against the Bristol Channel cutter fleet. In all those &nbsp;sea miles <em>Rawanah</em> proved herself to be a sea kindly, robust vessel, &nbsp;gentle on the helm, making good passage time and capable in rough &nbsp;weather.</p>\n<p><em>Rawanah</em> is currently undergoing restoration in Crinan Boatyard and will hopefully be afloat in 2022.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.0785174347720066, "draft": 1.493538161424043, "fore_triangle_base": 5.273104120946111, "fore_triangle_height": 9.723238234576932, "length_on_waterline": 9.525115825408436, "length_over_all": 10.698610095098756, "main": {"foot": 4.26725188978298, "head": 3.627164106315533, "luff": 6.2484759814679345}, "mizzen": {"foot": 3.0480370641306997, "luff": 6.272860277980979}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.999255819, "topsail": {"luff": 5.334064862228725, "perpendicular": 2.43842965130456}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Crinan", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "a0055f2c-31ce-4cb7-9978-077c05ef268f", "image_key": "v6gTDt", "length_on_deck": 10.921, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Rawanah", "oga_no": 141, "ownerships": [{"end": "?", "name": "H Brown", "share": 64, "start": 1935}, {"end": 1954, "name": "Dr D.M.
