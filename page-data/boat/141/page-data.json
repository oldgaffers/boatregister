The\nresult was <em>Rawanah</em>, built by Harry King at Pin Mill, perhaps inspired by\n<em>Awara</em> also built there in 1932.</p>\n<p><em>Rawanah</em> \u00a0was registered in \u00a0Ipswich to Hubert Arnold Brown, a good friend of\nMaurice Griffiths, \u00a0who had commissioned the build, and then the vessel passed\nto the Jersey Register on 3 November 1950 when she was bought by the Hollick\nbrothers \u00a0at St Lawrence, Jersey.</p>\n<p>She features in Maurice Griffiths' book \u00a0'Little Ships &amp; Shoal Waters'\nrecounting a voyage he made, together \u00a0with Hubert Brown, from Oban to East\nTarbert. The book also contains \u00a0line drawings and sail plan.\u00a0 She was in the\nownership of one family for \u00a042 years.</p>\n<p>Between 2005\u00a0and 2015, <em>Rawanah</em> sailed thousands of \u00a0miles to the Outer and\n Inner Hebrides, Orkney and Faroe Isles, Scilly \u00a0Isles, and Ireland three times\n including a circumnavigation in July 2008. \u00a0She won the 'Cock o' the Bristol\nChannel Race' with courses of 80 and 50 \u00a0miles competing against the Bristol\nChannel cutter fleet. In all those \u00a0sea miles <em>Rawanah</em> proved herself to be a\nsea kindly, robust vessel, \u00a0gentle on the helm, making good passage time and\ncapable in rough \u00a0weather.</p>\n<p><em>Rawanah</em> is currently undergoing restoration in Crinan Boatyard and will\n hopefully be afloat in 2026.</p>", "generic_type": ["Yacht"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.301, "draft": 1.5, "fore_triangle_base": 5.273, "fore_triangle_height": 9.723, "length_on_deck": 10.921, "length_on_waterline": 9.525, "length_over_all": 10.698, "main": {"foot": 4.267, "head": 3.627, "luff": 6.248}, "mizzen": {"foot": 3.048, "luff": 6.273}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.999255819, "topsail": {"luff": 5.334, "perpendicular": 2.438}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Crinan", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "a0055f2c-31ce-4cb7-9978-077c05ef268f", "image_key": "v6gTDt", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Rawanah", "oga_no": 141, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 1013, "member": 6254, "share": 64, "start": 2019}, {"end": "?", "name": "H Brown", "share": 64, "start": 1935}, {"end": 1954, "name": "Dr D.M.
