She has 2 mast steps and 5 rig\nconfigurations, including a single balanced lug rig, lug yawl rig(with tent for\ncamping), cruising gaff rig, high-performance gaff rig (with trapeze), and\n\"cat-boat style\" single gaff mainsail.</p>\n<p>She is constructed in plywood and carbon fibre, with an entirely carbon fibre\nrig. This makes her very light and strong, whilst maintening a traditional,\nclinker aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The boat is self-draining, even in the unlikely event of being entirely swamped.\nShe has generous freeboard and a huge amount of integrated buoyancy. This makes\nher a very safe coastal cruising boat.<br />\nShe also has optional water ballast tanks beneath the cockpit sole, adding upto\n70kg of ballast, making her virtually uncapsizeable!</p>\n<p>I have taken moulds of the hull and interior to produce further double-skinned,\ncored grp hulls, if there is interest.</p>", "generic_type": ["Dinghy"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.753, "draft": 1.28, "length_on_deck": 4.648, "length_on_waterline": 4.511}, "home_country": "England ", "home_port": "Woodbridge ", "hull_form": "centre-boarder", "image_key": "5FWBNx", "lastModified": "2026-01-11T22:37:33Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "R\u00e6dwald", "oga_no": 3798, "place_built": "Woodbridge, Suffolk", "rig_type": "Sloop", "short_description": "<p>A new spirit of tradition, high-performance sailing dinghy.</p>", "spar_material": "carbon_composite", "updated_at": "2026-01-12", "website": "https://www.modernclassicboats.com", "year": 2025, "year_of_build": {"value": 2025}}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3798"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
