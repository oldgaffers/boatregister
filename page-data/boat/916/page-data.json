Besides being a successful\ndesigner Gilbert was a first rate helmsman winning the gold medal in his own\ndesign at the 1908 Olympics. His 6-metre yacht \u201c<em>Dormy</em>\u201d was placed respectively\n1st, 2nd and 3rd in the three race event held off Ryde, Isle of Wight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concept of the \u2018canoe yawl\u2019 theme was continued by Gilbert from his early\ntutelage with Albert Strange. The Canoe Yawl Association describes the style as\nbeing a slim, easily-driven, decked hull with a stem at each end and carrying a\nyawl rig. Gilbert Laws\u2019 design was a continuation of Strange\u2019s work combined\nwith his own development from days as a youth paddling canoes. The low aspect\nratio of the yawl rig suited the narrow beam better than would a single-masted\nrig: its divided sail area\u00a0much assisted helm balance, maneuverability, and\nprogress in strong winds combined with no need for a paid hand. The sail area\nmay be rapidly reduced in a strong blow by reefing the mainsail down to leave a\n\u2018jib and mizzen\u2019 configuration for safe, well-balanced progress. Such a style\nwas particularly developed in the 1880s at the Humber Yawl Club. The sails may\nbe of any fore-and-aft type, and in any combination, and whether the mizzen is\nbefore or behind the rudder post (the\u00a0technical definitions of ketch and yawl)\nis of no consequence to the Association rather it is more a matter of\u00a0sail\ndistribution and proportion.</p>\n<p>The association considered the canoe yawl as a subtle combination of hull and\nrig proportions which, in general, could not be achieved by conversion from\nother design types such as a sloop or cutter as in such circumstances it was\nthought unlikely that the hull would suit given its beam and the need for the\nmainmast to be relocated. Such an exercise, with no guarantee of success, was\ndeemed to be ill-advised. It was admitted that for a given building cost the\ncanoe yawl provides less capacity and accommodation\u00a0but greater length than a\nsloop or cutter. Its relative unpopularity in the commercial marketplace was due\nto its lesser capacity and higher mooring charges but was deemed ideal for those\nnot wishing to sleep 4-up in a small boat and who avoid marinas where possible.\nRather for those demanding beauty and performance in their boat with the most\nappropriate rig for the single- or short-handed sailor across the full range of\nconditions likely to be encountered \u2014 including those where many sloops or\ncutters would be unmanageable, then the rig was deemed ideal.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Dawn</em> was built at the yard of W E Thomas in Falmouth. According to the 1891\ncensus Thomas was born in Ruan Minor(?) and was living at 2 Arwyn Cottage with\nhis sons Betram 25 and Thomas 21. Thomas\u2019 yard was well known for its design and\nbuild of Quay Punts but was eventually closed in after which the property was\ndeveloped to include the present Falmouth Maritime Museum.</p>\n<p>In 1924 an engine was fitted.</p>\n<p><em>Dawn</em> sailed to Dover in May 1940 with a small volunteer flotilla led by the\nDartmouth steam ferry to join \u2018Operation Dynamo\u2019 but in fact poor weather\ndelayed their arrival to permit full participation. Dawn\u2019s participation at\nDunkirk is set out in David Devine\u2019s \u201cThe Nine days of Dunkirk\u201d published in\n1959. This action is further substantiated by Mr A J Gush of 8 East Street,\nChard, Somerset who\u2019s correspondence on board dated 16.11.86 wrote of confirming\nher presence with the then owner in Solihull.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Owners</strong> of <em>Dawn</em> have included:-</p>\n<p>1906 <strong>H S Algar</strong> of 2 Kingston Villas Romford and who by 1938 lived at Lusaka,\nKirby Road, Walton, Colchester.

In the 1881 Census he was\nin the Devon &amp; Exeter Hospital, in 1901 he was on board HMS Wanderer in Gotland\nHarbour. In 1911 he was living with his mother at 10 Bridge Street Lyme Regis\nand his occupation was stated as \u2018fishmonger\u2019 after his mother. He married Julia\nAnne and died in 1922 at Lyme Regis aged 48 when his occupation was a \u2018coach\nbody builder\u2019. <em>Dawn</em> appears to have been sold from the estate.</p>\n<p>1923 - 1954 <strong>John Roger Gregory</strong> of Little Ravenswell Kingswear.
