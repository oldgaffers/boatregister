Originally she was raced successfully and later was used for chartering. She was re-built in 1982-3 with the keelson as the only original piece of timber left. She is double planked in cedar to the waterline with light timbers of iron wood. The topsides are fir and the deck is triple planked finished in Port Orford cedar.<p>She was imported into the UK in 2003 and in five years had three owners who improved her but did little sailing as her spars and sail plan was over-canvassed. This resulted in excessive weather helm and an un-seaworthy boat. Anthony Wheaton purchased her in 2008 and is continuing her improvement. He has replaced the over-canvassed rig which had a boom that overhung the counter by 10ft with a balanced sail plan designed by Ed Burnett.","image_key":"k2HJ4Q","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"wood plank on frame","draft":2.5146,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.801146061936113,"main":{"foot":8.549743964886613,"head":6.589856132650573,"luff":5.318824676908071},"thcf":1.196,"draft":2.5146305779078273,"topsail":{"luff":10.198732016581321,"perpendicular":3.9990246281394777},"sailarea":130.3653016212939,"propellor":{"type":"folding","blades":3},"length_over_all":12.798707632284808,"fore_triangle_base":7.900512070226774,"length_on_waterline":11.100950987564008,"fore_triangle_height":16.099731772738355},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":12.7986,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"One off plank on edge design inspired by G Watson.

Steeped in history, she was built in California in 1904 as a plank-on-edge yacht with a towering rig.  Her traditional appearance continues throughout with traditional ropes, authentic block and tackles. Of course, looks arenâ€™t the only thing going for this classic yacht. The redesigned sail plan by Ed Burnett uses modern sailcloth to give the boat power and speed when slicing through the waves. Think of her as a lightweight pilot cutter.  This yacht is one of the most cool and recognisable classic boats in the UK and was featured twice out of 1500 boats in the Round the Island Race 2021 official videoclip (see below).  Where ever moored, she attracts visits from envious sailors and from the public. She has active followers on her website, facebook and Instagram pages. http://www.roundtheisland.org.uk/web/code/php/main_c.php?map=rir22&ui=rir5&style=std&override=&section=multimedia&page=videolibrary     at 45 and 51 secs  Fully equipped for racing and cruising, she is in excellent condition having just returned from a visit to Douarnenez.
