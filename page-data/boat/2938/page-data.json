Originally she was raced successfully and later was used for chartering. She was re-built in 1982-3 with the keelson as the only original piece of timber left. She is double planked in cedar to the waterline with light timbers of iron wood. The topsides are fir and the deck is triple planked finished in Port Orford cedar.<p>She was imported into the UK in 2003 and in five years had three owners who improved her but did little sailing as her spars and sail plan was over-canvassed. This resulted in excessive weather helm and an un-seaworthy boat. Anthony Wheaton purchased her in 2008 and is continuing her improvement. He has replaced the over-canvassed rig which had a boom that overhung the counter by 10ft with a balanced sail plan designed by Ed Burnett.","image_key":"k2HJ4Q","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"wood plank on frame","draft":2.5146,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.801146061936113,"main":{"foot":8.549743964886613,"head":6.589856132650573,"luff":5.318824676908071},"thcf":1.196,"draft":2.5146305779078273,"topsail":{"luff":10.198732016581321,"perpendicular":3.9990246281394777},"sailarea":130.3653016212939,"propellor":{"type":"folding","blades":3},"length_over_all":12.798707632284808,"fore_triangle_base":7.900512070226774,"length_on_waterline":11.100950987564008,"fore_triangle_height":16.099731772738355},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":12.7986,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"One off plank on edge design inspired by G Watson.
