Steeped in history, she was built in California in 1904 as a plank-on-edge yacht with a towering rig. Her traditional appearance continues throughout with traditional ropes, authentic block and tackles. Of course, looks aren\u2019t the only thing going for this classic yacht. The redesigned sail plan by Ed Burnett uses modern sailcloth to give the boat power and speed when slicing through the waves. Think of her as a lightweight pilot cutter. This yacht is one of the most cool and recognisable classic boats in the UK and was featured twice out of 1500 boats in the Round the Island Race 2021 official videoclip (see below). Where ever moored, she attracts visits from envious sailors and from the public. She has active followers on her website, facebook and Instagram pages. http://www.roundtheisland.org.uk/web/code/php/main_c.php?map=rir22&amp;ui=rir5&amp;style=std&amp;override=&amp;section=multimedia&amp;page=videolibrary at 45 and 51 secs Fully equipped for racing and cruising, she is in excellent condition having just returned from a visit to Douarnenez.
