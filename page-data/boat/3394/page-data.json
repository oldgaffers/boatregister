John was an electrical engineer working at Marconi in Chelmsford and he built this boat as an academic challenge based on the 20&#39; &#39;Sopranino&#39;, a famous little offshore racer which inspired many young men in 1952 by being sailed across the Atlantic by Colin Mudie and Patrick Ellam. It was whilst he was &nbsp;building &#39;Essex Melody&#39; at Maldon, Essex that John became involved with the owners of old gaff boats being restored in the same boatyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once he had completed &#39;Essex Melody&#39; he put all his energies into initiating the link up between the South Coast and East Coast Old Gaffers to form the Old Gaffers Association in 1963. &#39;Essex Melody&#39; therefore played a significant role in the formation of the OGA as we know it today. The first meetings were held in John&rsquo;s house in Maldon and also at the Maldon Little Ship Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Rogers, East Coast OGA member and training officer at Maldon Little Ship Club (MLSC), found this classic Maldon-built 23-footer &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo; in 2008. She was in a very dilapidated state, her covers blown off, sitting on an old trailer near Newark. The full story of her history and remarkable connection with the OGA, despite her Bermudan rig, may be found <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/rescuing-essex-melody-43426\" target=\"_blank\">in Practical Boat Owner, June 2016</a>. A few extracts and photos from the article are reproduced here, with permission from PBO.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First published in Gaffers Log, July, 2016</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We were taken aback by the passion the current owners had for &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo;. She had obviously given them hours of pleasure around the Trent, the Wash and north Norfolk. They told us she was built by John Scarlett along the lines of the first JOG (Junior Offshore Group) yacht &lsquo;Sopranino&rsquo;, and launched at Maldon in 1959. They also informed us John was a member of MLSC and connected with the OGA, which confused us somewhat as she is Bermudan-rigged!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Scarlett documented every hour spent building &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo;, and took pictures at each stage of her construction. Finally, in September 1959, after 3,581 hours&rsquo; work, she was launched from Dan Webb and Feesey&rsquo;s yard in the presence of Eric Payne, Commodore of Marconi Sailing Club.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With her extensive heritage background, &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo; was a compelling case for a full restoration. We built a boatshed around her in our garden in Maldon and she became our heritage project and a great source of local interest. After 18 months of hard work and the help of many friends, &lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo; was taken to MarineStore and relaunched in the same place where she was first launched in 1959. To celebrate, on 16 April, 2011, John Scarlett&rsquo;s daughter and grandchildren poured champagne over the figurehead in the presence of around 100 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Essex Melody&rsquo; is a unique example of a JOG yacht: she certainly is a head-turner, and John Scarlett, first Secretary of the OGA in 1963, seems to have got it right first time!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>John Rogers, EC Area</p>","image_key":"zCJjkC","uk_part1":"301964","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel Honduruas Mahogany on Oak.
