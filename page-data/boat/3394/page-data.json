John was an electrical engineer working at Marconi in Chelmsford and he\nbuilt this boat as an academic challenge based on the 20' 'Sopranino', a famous\nlittle offshore racer which inspired many young men in 1952 by being sailed\nacross the Atlantic by Colin Mudie and Patrick Ellam. It was whilst he was\n\u00a0building 'Essex Melody' at Maldon, Essex that John became involved with the\nowners of old gaff boats being restored in the same boatyard.</p>\n<p>Once he had completed 'Essex Melody' he put all his energies into initiating the\nlink up between the South Coast and East Coast Old Gaffers to form the Old\nGaffers Association in 1963. 'Essex Melody' therefore played a significant role\nin the formation of the OGA as we know it today. The first meetings were held in\nJohn\u2019s house in Maldon and also at the Maldon Little Ship Club.</p>\n<p>John Rogers, East Coast OGA member and training officer at Maldon Little Ship\nClub (MLSC), found this classic Maldon-built 23-footer \u2018Essex Melody\u2019 in 2008.\nShe was in a very dilapidated state, her covers blown off, sitting on an old\ntrailer near Newark. The full story of her history and remarkable connection\nwith the OGA, despite her Bermudan rig, may be found <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/rescuing-essex-melody-43426\">in Practical Boat Owner,\nJune 2016</a>.

They told us she was built by John Scarlett along the lines of\nthe first JOG (Junior Offshore Group) yacht \u2018Sopranino\u2019, and launched at Maldon\nin 1959. They also informed us John was a member of MLSC and connected with the\nOGA, which confused us somewhat as she is Bermudan-rigged!\u00a0</p>\n<p>John Scarlett documented every hour spent building \u2018Essex Melody\u2019, and took\npictures at each stage of her construction. Finally, in September 1959, after\n3,581 hours\u2019 work, she was launched from Dan Webb and Feesey\u2019s yard in the\npresence of Eric Payne, Commodore of Marconi Sailing Club.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With her extensive heritage background, \u2018Essex Melody\u2019 was a compelling case for\na full restoration. We built a boatshed around her in our garden in Maldon and\nshe became our heritage project and a great source of local interest. After 18\nmonths of hard work and the help of many friends, \u2018Essex Melody\u2019 was taken to\nMarineStore and relaunched in the same place where she was first launched in\n1959. To celebrate, on 16 April, 2011, John Scarlett\u2019s daughter and\ngrandchildren poured champagne over the figurehead in the presence of around 100\npeople.</p>\n<p>\u2018Essex Melody\u2019 is a unique example of a JOG yacht: she certainly is a\nhead-turner, and John Scarlett, first Secretary of the OGA in 1963, seems to\nhave got it right first time!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>John Rogers, EC Area</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.134, "draft": 0.61, "length_on_deck": 6.858, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Maldon", "id": "6b0ffbe5-50a5-408e-b754-e489ffc36814", "image_key": "zCJjkC", "mainsail_type": "bermudan", "name": "Essex Melody", "oga_no": 3394, "ownerships": [{"end": 2, "name": "", "note": "2nd owner Mike Eastgate,,3rd owner Ray Burkin, 4th Owner Geoff Slack.
