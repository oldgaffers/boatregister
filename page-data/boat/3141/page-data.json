Her\noriginal engine was a Kelvin Bergius 2 cylinder paraffin. Little is known about\nher first two owners but in 1955 she was sold to Reville Farrell who was the\nstate solicitor in Waterford and cruised 'Susanna' on the South coast of Ireland\nand made trips to Brittany and Northern Spain.</p>\n<p>According to Susanna's fifth owner, John McConnell, whilst returning from\nSantander in 1958 Farrell was forced, with his crew Paddy Walshe to heave to for\n36 hours by a severe gale. Reville said if they hadn't run out of whiskey it\nwould have been 48. At this point Reville decided he needed something bigger and\nreluctantly sold 'Susanna'. He told the purchaser she had a slightly worn rudder\ngudgeon and a soft spot on the port side of the coach roof. When surveyed the\nreport found that apart from these two points she was perfect.</p>\n<p>The new owner John Mc Connell, former Commodore of the Royal Dublin Yacht Club,\nsailed her round to Dun Laoghaire with his wife Maimie and two crew. It took\nthem 31 hours to cover the nearly 150 miles. 'Susanna' had been launched with a\n3/4 rig but he replaced the mast with a new 42ft one and converted her to a mast\nhead rig. He campaigned her with great suscess in RORC races winning the 1964\nIrish Sea Race ahead of stiff competition (Angus Primrose in 'Green Highlander'\nand Fabius skippered by Cdr. Errol Bruce).</p>\n<p>In 1964 she changed hands once more to an American owner who did not do too well\nin RORC events. He came last in the Fastnet Race, having existed on beer and\nfruit juice as there was a leak in the water tanks before he left the Solent.\nFive years later she was sold again to Alfred Abels. He did not race her but\ncruised, Western Isles, Ireland and Brittany. When his son started work he\ncontinued to cruise single handed and fitted a roller headsail, auto helm and an\nelectric winch. He sailed from her base in Bristol well into his 70s.</p>\n<p>She was beginning to show her age when she was bought by Laurence Gerring in\n1992. The Gerring family worked on the outside in the first part of 1992,\nfinding it basically sound but the deck needed re-paying and a new forehatch was\nmade out of teak. They sailed the rest of the season. In the winter of 1992-3\nthey looked at the accommodation, which was basic, O'Connell altering the\noriginal to keep the weight down for racing. They sailed her on long summer\ncruises to Brittany.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.5908, "draft": 1.524, "fore_triangle_base": 4.87685930260912, "fore_triangle_height": 9.29652523774689, "length_on_deck": 10.2108, "length_on_waterline": 7.620092660326749, "length_over_all": 10.2109363569861, "length_over_spars": 12.03975859546452, "main": {"foot": 4.724469641550841, "luff": 11.099945135332845}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 45.489261282129696, "thcf": 0.981}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Guernsey", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "c5d3d6f5-0ecd-4025-ad2b-d78731dbdf49", "image_key": "Jw3KrC", "mainsail_type": "bermudan", "name": "Susanna", "oga_no": 3141, "ownerships": [{"id": 88, "member": 1709, "share": 64}, {"end": 1949, "name": "RC Thorne", "share": 64, "start": 1936}, {"end": 1955, "name": "DHW Swiney", "share": 64, "start": 1949}, {"end": 1957, "name": "Reville Farrell", "share": 64, "start": 1955}, {"end": 1964, "name": "John McConnell", "share": 64, "start": 1957}, {"end": 1969, "name": "Donald Stearns", "share": 64, "start": 1964}, {"end": 1992, "name": "Alfred Abels", "share": 64, "start": 1969}, {"end": 2003, "name": "Laurence Gerring", "share": 64, "start": 1992}, {"end": 2004, "name": "Karl Ronald Bacchus", "share": 64, "start": 2003}, {"end": 2010, "name": "Giles Sibun", "share": 64, "start": 2004}], "place_built": "Burnham on Crouch", "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "198", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'Susanna' has an interesting history of racing and cruising since the 1950s.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "uk_part1": "164699", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1936, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3141"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
