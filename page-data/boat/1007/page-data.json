She was originally rigged as a gaff sloop and had an air cooled Ducatti diesel with a folding prop. In the right conditions and hands she is a very fast boat. Arthur Holt thinks this was the first boat to be fitted with a full size lifting keel of 3/4 ton, interchangeable gaff and bermudan rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1986 she passed back into Arthur Holt&#39;s hands - he had a Bermudan rig built for another long thin boat called &#39;Kraken&#39; which he transferred to &#39;Hanser&#39;, moving the mast back 5&#39; onto the coachroof. He also made a gaff main which worked on the Bermudan mast so he could take part in OGA events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabian Bush, who trained under Arthur, acquired the boat in 1999 and he started to change things. The engine was replaced by an outboard and a tiny mizzen added for handling under sail. The mast was moved back into the original position but on a tabernacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latterly she has been sailed with a gaff main. The rudder and keel format have been altered and more ballast added for sail carrying capacity. A short bowsprit has been added, making the boat more of a family cruiser than a racer. A new mainsail was made in 2013 and a deeper analysis of the boat is planned.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.2342, "draft": 0.8382, "fore_triangle_base": 4.57205559619605, "fore_triangle_height": 10.287143379663496, "length_on_deck": 10.9728, "length_on_waterline": 10.36332601804438, "length_over_all": 10.972933430870519, "length_over_spars": 13.106559375762009, "main": {"foot": 3.0226591075347478, "head": 2.2098329675688855, "luff": 5.7912704218483295}, "mizzen": {"foot": 1.3208241892221408, "head": 0.8382284808583271, "luff": 2.5908436966593515}, "sailarea": 38.88957309782196, "thcf": 1.032}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "d751add7-7152-4af1-ad2f-c84093c1507e", "image_key": "LBJBjj", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Hanser", "oga_no": 1007, "ownerships": [{"end": 1986, "name": "Nigel and Jean Willimot", "share": 64, "start": 1974}, {"end": 1999, "name": "Arthur Holt", "share": 64, "start": 1986}, {"current": true, "id": 332, "member": 3831, "share": 64, "start": 1999}], "place_built": "Heybridge", "rig_type": "Yawl", "sail_number": "1007", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'Hanser' was designed and built for Nigel &amp; Jean Willimot as a fast weekend sailer.
