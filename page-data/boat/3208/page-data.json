Phyllis was commissioned by FW Whitely, a longstanding member of the RMYC and a restricted class yachtsman. She was designed by GH Wilmer and completed in June 1913 at Sam Bond's yard in Rockferry. Phylis is built to the RMRC envelope specification but with a slightly shorter length, a slightly heavier build and a deeper keel. FW Whitely is said to have sailed her directly to Hibre Island where his family still keep a summer cottage today.","image_key":"wsNjN5","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":1.2192,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":19.25,"head":11.25,"luff":13.83},"sailarea":4,"length_overall":8.2296,"length_over_spars":9.7536,"length_on_waterline":7.3152},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.2296,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Phyllis is the only example of the Royal Mersey Restricted Class currently afloat.","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:40:04.107379+00:00","website":"www.theyachtphyllis.co.uk","beam":2.6914,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"cb17e76b-9888-4502-85a6-c7640e16e6ce","designer":"9ecf6474-7c74-4a12-9ef0-c563196d0b28","design_class":"9c848d9b-5e0b-4f92-86f6-71fdf3199708","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Royal Mersey"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"G H Willmer"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"S.F.
