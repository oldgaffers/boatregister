Phylis is built to the RMRC envelope specification but with a slightly shorter length, a slightly heavier build and a deeper keel. FW Whitely is said to have sailed her directly to Hibre Island where his family still keep a summer cottage today.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.6914, "draft": 1.2192, "length_on_deck": 8.2296, "length_on_waterline": 7.3152, "length_over_spars": 9.7536, "length_overall": 8.2296, "main": {"foot": 19.25, "head": 11.25, "luff": 13.83}, "sailarea": 4}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Deganwy", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "5319ebc6-3afe-409a-b0a7-0d111f8b8e1f", "image_key": "wsNjN5", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Phyllis", "oga_no": 3208, "ownerships": [{"name": "Kevin Goulding", "share": 64, "start": 2001}], "place_built": "Rock Ferry, Wirral", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Phyllis is the only example of the Royal Mersey Restricted Class currently afloat.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "ssr": "R1387", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-n3BPrLQ/0/Th/i-n3BPrLQ-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "website": "www.theyachtphyllis.co.uk", "year": 1913, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3208"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
