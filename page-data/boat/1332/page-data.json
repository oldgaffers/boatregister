She was re-named in 1945 Mermaid, by Worfolk Bros., Kings Lynn, who refitted and sold her to T. Lineham of Sutton Bridge.  She fished the Wash until 1980.  Bought by Jack Waterhouse &amp; his son of Woodrolfe Boatyard, Tollesbury, Essex, who rebuilt her back to her early state of sail, (Tan main, white headsails and topsail) in 1980 from Tony Lineham.  They started to rebuild her in October 1981 renewing frames &amp; floors. 70% of the planking, covering boards, stanchions etc. also mast spars sand rigging.  The sails are by Tailors of Maldon.
