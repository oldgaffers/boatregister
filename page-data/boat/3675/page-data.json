Having\nsailed on Falmouth working boats I think of her as a smaller cousin. Recently\n<em>Knotty</em> has undergone some quite extensive renovations below waterline. Hull\nstripped down to gelcoat; Keel reinforced with an 8\u201d epoxy GRP wrap around then\nepoxy coatings/antifoul applied. Internally, the old Cornish concrete was\nremoved, the hull reinforced with polyester resin GRP and chrome steel punchings\nadded. A new plywood floor has been built (similar to <em>Ariel of Greystones</em> \u2013\nsee their website for info). New Plywood bulkheads and a new plywood /hardwood\ndeck in work but needs completion (The level of the deck has been raised with a\nfalse bulwark). Unfortunately, a change in circumstances forces her sale but\nthis would be an ideal winter project for someone. She is currently lying on a\nmarina berth in Sovereign Harbour in Eastbourne with a temporary watertight\ncover.  <em>Knotty</em>\u2019s hull is on sale for the princely sum of \u00a31. She can also be\nbought with a cruising gaff rig with bowsprit and topsail, a 6hp Tohatsu sail\ndrive outboard with very low hours and a selection of hardwood sufficient to\ncomplete the new deck. All of these are negotiable on\u00a0price.</p>", "summary": "<p>sold through another route, but did generate 2 enquiries through the OGA</p>"}], "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.929, "draft": 0.814, "length_on_deck": 5.639, "length_on_waterline": 5.639}, "home_country": "UK", "home_port": "Sovereign Harbour Eastbourne", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "image_key": "TqfqNQ", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Knot A Clew", "oga_no": 3675, "ownerships": [{"end": 2024, "name": "Peter Mayhew", "share": 64, "start": "2011"}], "place_built": "Mylor Bridge", "previous_names": ["Trisso"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "50", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2024-11-20", "year": 1975, "year_is_approximate": true}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3675"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
