Peter died in 2019\nand his beloved boat has been sadly neglected since then. Much as I would like\nto keep her I know this is not realistic and she needs new, active and capable\nowners.</p>\n<p>During the 47 years Peter owned her she cruised the French waterways from the\nChannel to the Med, coming back through the Canal du Midi and across Biscay. In\nthe 1980s and 90s we went to the Baltic, the Netherlands and the north coast of\nSpain. <em>Stormalong's</em> regular cruising grounds were the West Country, Channel\nIslands, the north and south coasts of Brittany and the Biscay coast of France.</p>\n<p>In 1990 her petrol Watermotor engine was replaced with a Perkins Perama with an\nAquadrive. Some work on the starboard side hull was carried out by a wooden boat\nyard in Douarnenez in 2013.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.652, "draft": 1.615, "length_on_deck": 9.144, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "home_country": "UK", "home_port": "Dartmouth", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "c1a2a6c5-d9bc-43a6-9923-3549e4784132", "image_key": "rdN6ch", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Stormalong", "oga_no": 971, "ownerships": [{"name": "J Cumberlidge", "share": 64, "start": 2012}, {"current": true, "id": 35217, "member": 6739, "share": 64, "start": "2012"}], "place_built": "Boston", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p><em>Stormalong</em> is currently on the River Rance and is in need of significant work\nto bring her back into the wonderful cruising boat she has been.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "uk_part1": "147971", "year": 1936, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/971"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
