The Sea Otter 15 is a fully decked, minimally ballasted day boat with a lug main and mizzen on unstayed masts. With two sails set on booms tacking is simple but sailing requires some skill to get the best out of her. She came second in her class, three up in light winds in the 2021 Maldon Regatta. David has developed his Sea Otter range of double ended Canoe Yawls following his apprenticeship building local double ended pilot boats. David's tapering strip planking follows the conventional line of the sheer. as would be the case in carvel boatbuilding, allowing the bright finished interior to show the wood grain. The outside of the hull is faired and covered in hardwood veneer producing a very fine paint finished surface. <em>Doris</em> had her 21st birthday this year but you would be hard pressed to guess that from her well maintained appearance. <p><em>Doris</em> comes complete with two sets of sails, cockpit and travelling covers, a decent pair of oars, buoyancy, Honda 2.3 long shaft outboard (2020) and a well prepared road trailer plus the usual required extras.
