The mainsail has 3 slab reefs, 1 in the staysail and the jib is on a Wykham-Martin furler with a smaller no 2 option.  With a slippery hull, new sails and a feathering propeller, she is very competitive when racing and a fast, dry cruising boat.  She sleeps 5, a double in the forepeak, 2 full length settee berths and a pilot berth in the saloon yet is easily single handed with a tiller pilot and the excellent sea feather winvane steering gear.  The saloon seats 6 around the drop leaf table, the galley has a 2 burner cooker with grill and oven, a sink and cold water pump, and ample storage. The heads is uncommonly aft, handy underway and more private than amidships at night.","image_key":"j48GTB","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":"GRP","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":3.048,"main":{"foot":6.096,"head":5.486,"luff":4.572},"thcf":0.977,"draft":1.5240185320653499,"topsail":{"luff":3.658,"perpendicular":4.267},"sailarea":67.479,"propellor":{"type":"folding"},"length_on_deck":8.535,"length_over_all":8.53450377956596,"fore_triangle_base":11.278,"length_on_waterline":8.077,"fore_triangle_height":5.182},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.5344,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Bethany is a very rare flush decked Heard 28, so has a large uncluttered foredeck, standing headroom below, and true workboat lines.","updated_at":"2022-07-05T20:37:09.3302+00:00","website":"","beam":3.048,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"ownerships":[{"id":817,"share":64,"member":5879,"current":true}],"builder":"3bce15f6-ee0f-46a9-a70d-a8cead71eda4","designer":"7ac480da-7d09-4dd7-9c89-61199ff30913","design_class":"47040682-ee05-42de-a493-400ebd5956db","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"cold_moulded"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Heard 28"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Percy Dalton"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Gaffers and Luggers","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":32500,"flexibility":"normal","offered":"2022-06-08","price_flexibility":{"text":"normal"},"reduced":false,"sales_text":"Bethany is a very rare flush deck version of a Heard 28, the absence of coach roof gives true workboat lines, full standing headroom bellow and lots of deck space.
