She supposedly had her inspiration from an 80' Mylne ketch, and while her sheer line and ends show this inspiration her broad beam and centreboard are a practical response to the demands of British coastal cruising. Her hull construction is inch and a quarter mahogany glued and screwed on laminated mahogany frames, with laminated mahogany ring frames in way of her masts.<p>Glassed below the waterline, she has a teak deck over marine ply, and a wooden centreboard within ballast keel. Her hull was built to a high standard by Lathams in Poole, and she was finished by Mark Varvill in West Wittering before her launch in Birdham Pool in 1998, under her original name of Diligent II.<p>She was originally fitted out more or less as a day sailer, with an engine but almost no electronics and no winches. Everything was done with tackles. Varvill very sadly died prematurely, after having seen the boat winning her class in the 2001 Jubilee Regatta Round the Island Race. The boat was bought by Peter Muir who commissioned a thorough refit by Berthons for world cruising, including winches and a bow thruster, which makes her a very practical family boat, easily sailed by her very average husband and wife team.<p>On the other hand, when in regatta mode, her full complement of seven upwind sails means that a crew of a dozen can each have their own string! She was accidentally bought by Ed &amp; Frances Maggs, &ldquo;We didn't mean to buy a Gaffer&rdquo;, during a boatless summer caused by breaking the mast of their Stella in summer 2011. The boat, in a manoeuvre many &#39;owners&#39; will be familiar with, rather stuck her paw out at them from between the bars of the Lymington Boat's Home, and adopted them as her new parents. So far they have been delighted with her, and their only regret is that work has not yet allowed them to undertake the long cruise they dream of: cruising was initially limited to their home waters of the East Coast, Netherlands, Orkney, Cornwall, Channel Islands and Brittany.<p>More recently she has been undertaking a slow exploration of the West Coast of Ireland.
