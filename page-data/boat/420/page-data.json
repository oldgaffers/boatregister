Six were &nbsp;built in 1912 with a further four in 1914. Five Rivers Class yachts are &nbsp;thought to be still in existence: Arnside Sailing Club’s “Severn” &nbsp;'Deva', 'Dart', 'Styx' (all on the OGA Register) and 'Esk'.</p>\n<p>The &nbsp;Rivers Class were used largely for evening racing with a season running &nbsp;from May to July, with regatta race in July. The boats were also raced &nbsp;in August at the Straits Regatta on Anglesey. They were raced for prize &nbsp;money. In 1914 prize money was £44 when the average wage was £67. The &nbsp;Royal Mersey Yacht Club was based in Rock Ferry, a then prosperous area &nbsp;of Birkenhead with large houses overlooking the river.</p>\n<p>The &nbsp;design was based upon the Blackpool and Fleetwood Jewel Class. The boats &nbsp;were originally opened decked. They had a crew of three. The boats cost &nbsp;£50 each delivered afloat with a further £14.18s for the sails. (In &nbsp;total £4000 in 2021 prices, labour was a lot cheaper then).</p>\n<p><em>Mersey</em> was the flagship of the class being owned by Charles Livingstone, the &nbsp;Vice Commodore of the Club. The Commodore, an honorary position was the &nbsp;17th Earl of Derby. Charles was related to the founders of the Cunard &nbsp;and MacIver Shipping Lines. He owned <em>Aruda</em>a 30 tonne yacht and went on to own<em> Kentra</em>, an 85 foot, 94 tonne yacht built by Fifes in Scotland. <em>Kentra</em> is still in existence and has been sailed round the world. Charles &nbsp;lived in the centre of Liverpool in a large Georgian house on Dale St. &nbsp;Under Charles Livingstone, Mersey won one race in 1914.</p>\n<p>In 1914 <em>Mersey </em>was brought by Lt Hugh McNeille-Gibb, first officer of HMS<em> Conway</em>, &nbsp;a merchant navy training ship anchored in the Mersey off Rock Ferry. At &nbsp;the same time his commanding officer Captain Harvey Broadbent acquired &nbsp;Arnside Sailing Club’s <em>Severn</em>, then known as <em>Ribble</em>. &nbsp;At one stage Hugh worked for the White Star Line. Hugh McNeille-Gibb was a better sailor than his commanding officer, owning a succession of &nbsp;larger yachts including <em>Inknoo</em>, which was later owned by Joe Wallace, who restored <em>Severn </em>after she was raised from the bed of the Mersey. One of Hugh’s yachts <em>Caird </em>had to be re-handicapped to stop him winning so many races.</p>\n<p>After the First World War <em>Mersey </em>was owned by S. McLauchlan in partnership with a succession of other people till 1937. <em>Mersey </em>won &nbsp;the Rivers Class series 10 times making her the most successful boat. &nbsp;In 1935 the Rivers Class were replaced by the Mylne Class. &nbsp;S.McLauchlan &nbsp;was instrumental in the selection of the new class. The flagship of &nbsp;Mylne Class was also called “<em>Mersey</em>”. She was owned by the Earl of Derby, the club’s Commodore.</p>\n<p>In 1939 Lloyds Register, <em>Mersey</em> is recorded as being owned by A.Manson of West Kirby in the Wirral. He was a member of the Royal Mersey Yacht and the West Kirby Sailing Club. &nbsp;There are entries for <em>Mersey</em> in 1947 and 48 Registers. The &nbsp;boat is recorded as being in Birkenhead though the owner is not named. &nbsp;She might briefly have been used as a fishing boat in the River Dee.</p>\n<p>Either just before the Second World War or after it, <em>Mersey </em>was &nbsp;moved to Pwllheli and then to Aberystwyth. In 1987 she was owned by &nbsp;Gron Davies, who mentions that he was restoring her in a letter to the Gaffers Log.</p>","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel built with counter stern.
