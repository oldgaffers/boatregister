In actual fact she is sister ship to Cherub III which was designed to have a transom stern, but was built with a canoe stern, although still a yawl. In 1930 another yawl rigged version, Galatea, was also built. Ariel probably remains Strange&#39;s only cutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her early history is well documented as her first owner JB Kirkpatrick wrote extensively about her in Yachting Monthly between 1925 and 1933. One trip (engineless and single-handed!) was from Heybridge to the Channel Islands and back in a week. She also sailed to Spain across Biscay as detailed in Kirkpatrick&#39;s book &quot;Little Ship Wanderings&quot; (1933).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1930 she was second in The Little Ship Club&#39;s inaugural Brightlingsea to Ostend race. This was their first ever handicap race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998 she was substantially restored by Peter and Jim Maynard. This included a redesigned sail plan by Gayle Heard which has radically altered her performance.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.5146, "draft": 1.3716, "fore_triangle_base": 5.7912704218483295, "fore_triangle_height": 7.467690807120214, "length_on_deck": 7.8486, "length_on_waterline": 6.9342843208973415, "length_over_all": 7.848695440136551, "main": {"foot": 5.6388685686417945, "head": 3.9624481833699097, "luff": 4.166666666666666}, "mizen_topsail": {"luff": 202.99926847110459, "perpendicular": 202.99926847110459}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.94074543, "topsail": {"luff": 4.57205559619605, "perpendicular": 2.13362594489149}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Shotley Marina", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "94df70a8-2198-4cc3-83f5-fd6040018c71", "image_key": "hZf6VZ", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Ariel", "oga_no": 207, "ownerships": [{"end": 2014, "name": "Neil Mordey", "share": 64, "start": 2007}, {"current": true, "id": 966, "member": 6180, "share": 64, "start": 2014}], "place_built": "Whitstable", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Built in 1925 for 'under \u00a3300' Ariel is a well constructed and practical small cruising gaff cutter designed by Albert Strange.</p>", "ssr": "132068", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-spdz8f5/0/Th/i-spdz8f5-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1925, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/207"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
