Fit out is done with marine ply, iroko and utile. Mast and spars\nare douglas fir. She is immensely strong, fast and seaworthy for her size, but\nboth she and her skipper prefer flattish water and around a F3 wind to give\nmaximum pleasure. The shallow draft makes her ideal for creek crawling and\nanchoring away from crowds. There is a 50kg steel centre plate and another 100kg\nof steel punchings are contained in bespoke boxes either side of the centre box.</p>\n<p>Estimated overall weight is 1650lb or 750kg ready to sail, and she tows easily\nbehind a VW Golf diesel. Sail area is 175 square feet or approx 16 square\nmetres. The cabin is smallish, but comfortable, with two aft-facing seats that\ntransform into part of the berths.</p>\n<p>There is a small meths stove and she can sleep two in comfort, with the help of\na cockpit tent for night stowage. She is perfect for sailing single-handed, as\nall work apart from anchoring can be\u00a0done from the cockpit.</p>\n<p>Based in Poole, I have attended several OGA events with her, including the 50th\nanniversary rally at Cowes in 2013, OGA 55 in 2018 and a number of other Solent\nevents each year.
