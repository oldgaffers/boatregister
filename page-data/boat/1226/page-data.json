Her builder/original owner intended her to be capable of single-handed sailing. She joined the East Coast gaffers, cruising and racing on the River Crouch and surrounding area during the 1980s.<p>Since 1993, she has been on permanent loan to the Hamble Sea Scouts.<p><blockquote><h3>Young gaffers on the Solent by Andy Cunningham</h3><h4>Originally published in Gaffers Log, December 2006<br/>Photo published with permission (Hamble Sea Scouts)</h4><p>In addition to the usual fun and excitement that occurs at the Solent OGA Annual Race and Rally was an unsung initiative instigated by Tom Cunliffe.<p>Believing that the OGA should introduce a new generation to the romance of gaffer sailing and seamanship skills, which are often neglected or allowed to slip in more modern yacht sailing, he invited one of the Hamble Sea Scout lads on to &lsquo;Westernman&rsquo;. for the days race. Luke Akhurst, 17 joined Tom for a never to be forgotten day. As part of the winning crew he went home with his own trophy to remember the experience.<p>In addition to this, Hamble Sea Scouts managed to get &lsquo;Stonechat&rsquo;, their elderly 30 foot, 11 ton gaff ketch around the course. Never a light winds flyer she picked up her skirts in the blustery conditions and reached just under 8 knots at times. Despite a broken main boom held together by sail ties she gave great sport. Helmed from start to finish by Chris Ackhurst, 14, crewed by Alex Cunningham, 13 and skippered by leader Terry Hawkes they were awarded the prize for most improved performance. Again both boys went home clutching half pint commemorative pots.<p>Now if that&rsquo;s not the way to get the younger generation to join in the fun and appreciate the past, I can&rsquo;t think what will. Hamble Sea Scouts would like to thank Tom Cunliffe and the OGA for their support and encouragement.</blockquote><p>In 2014, the OGA provided funds to support purchase of&nbsp;a VHF radio for &lsquo;Stonechat&rsquo;. <a href=\"https://www.oga.org.uk/_documents/%5B518574%5DStonechat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read a report here.</a><p>The sailing yacht &lsquo;Stonechat&rsquo; was privately built in Essex by the late Austin Edge. Originally intended to be used for short-handed cruising in the North Sea, she has a small cockpit.The design is loosely based on a Colin Archer design. She was built with much labour and love in ferrocement. Gaff-rigged ketch with cutter rig, she has a double ended construction with long moulded keel. Building commenced in October 1976 and she was launched in June 1978.<p>For 13 years &lsquo;Stonechat&rsquo; was used and maintained by an enthusiast of sailing. In October 1993 she was moved from Maldon, Essex to Mercury Marina, Hamble on voluntary loan to the Hamble Sea Scouts enabling them to gain experience and the joy of sailing a gaffer.","image_key":"nqrDqC","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Ketch","construction_material":"ferro","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"Ferrocement","draft":1.6246,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.590831504511095,"main":{"foot":3.5997317727383566,"head":3.2095830285296265,"luff":4.590343818580834},"thcf":0.946040857,"draft":1.6185076810534014,"mizzen":{"foot":1.7190929041697145,"head":1.9995123140697388,"luff":2.8986832479882954},"propellor":{"type":"fixed","blades":3},"length_over_all":9.601316752011703,"fore_triangle_base":4.5293830772982195,"length_on_waterline":8.080346257010484,"fore_triangle_height":9.400146305779078},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.6012,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Stonechat was built by the late Austin Edge for short-handed cruising in the North Sea.
