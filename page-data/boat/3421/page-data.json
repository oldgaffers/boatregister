Pain Clark, a lawyer, a keen sailor and one of the leading amateur yacht designers of early last century. Clark has 15 designs to his name, several of which are still sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clark designed Lona III for himself and had her built in Burnham on Crouch at the William King and Sons shipyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lona was raced with considerable success by her several owners, first on the river Crouch, later in Ireland and in Scotland, and then back again on the Crouch. After a life full of activity in the hands of several owners early 2011 Lona had been out of the water for three or four years and needed a caring hand to bring back her beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bart Carpentier found her in 2011 at Tradewind Yachts in Walsoorden in The Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of Lona&rsquo;s hull and deck was original, but the superstructure and interior were not. She once had an engine installed with an offset propeller, but that had disappeared when we discovered her. We also found evidence that she at one time has been converted to a yawl. The rig at this point in time in 2011 was a Marconi sloop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found lots of charming vintage details that we dismantled for later re-installation.&nbsp;At first sight (hihi) the hull and the interior looked promising, requiring some repairs here and there.Obviously, things were not so easy: quickly lots and lots more efforts proved necessary. We decided to engage in a thorough restoration with all respect for Lona&rsquo;s pedigree and her straightforward character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We first went down to the bare hull. The next two years Tradewind Yachts with the seasoned shipwright Dave Davidson repaired the structure, including replacing 74 of the 140 oak ribs with laminated and copper-fastened new ones. We then added 4 oak stringers to strengthen the hull and to provide the basis for the interior. The mast rail and main chain plates are new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We retained as much of the ship as possible: almost the entire structure, the planking and the deck have remained original. The stern area however was severely damaged: the hull planking, the solid end block (with Lona III carved in it) and the deck as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deck has been cleaned up with a reduced deck house and a basic cockpit &ndash; not more than a footwell. Some deck planking was added and the deck seams are new. We also removed the hopelessly jammed anchor winch and replaced it with an identical one we restored. The two deck hatches have been saved. The entire deck and roof remain soberly and uniformly un-varnished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lona interior general layout is very standard, but the execution and finishing are extra-lean. We kept the hull inside plain white and we cover the planking, ribs, floors and stringers as little as possible. It is all just too magnificent to hide, while Lona&rsquo;s furniture remains basic and functional.&nbsp;The interior has a classic general layout but in an extra-fresh and sober design, with the chart table at port side and a wet locker plus minimized galley at starbord. The engine is behind the steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Afromosia roof is un-varnished, similarly to the deck, and along with the stair and floorboards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are giving Lona again a magnificent gaff rig, entirely new and designed by Hoek Design with respect for Lona&rsquo;s age and styling. However, the design does take into account the significantly evolved insights in aerodynamics, with higher aspect sails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our spars are pitch pine and the mast is hollow. The bowsprit and the jackyards were made out of the earlier mast. Throughout we use wooden blocks and the deck fittings are bronze. It all blends into a homogenous whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found the perfect compass from Lona&rsquo;s era, coming from the SS Oakford. SS Oakford was built in 1900 and stranded on Texel - NL in 1934 with loss of all hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lona is equipped well, but only with the essentials to make her safe and manageable for short-handed real sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are not hiding any of the extra equipment that Lona did not have at her birth, but we blended things in as much as possible. The engine, the electrics and instruments, the winches are brought on board without harming the overall looks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine is nicely accessible under the cockpit and its controls are discreetly integrated in the cockpit SB side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We test-launched Lona briefly for checking her waterline and the engine and pumps. It was an experience of complete elegance, both in the air and in the water!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On relaunch Lona floated even nicer than we expected; perfectly balanced and light. Even better, after all these years on the dry, the hull was nearly dry. The engine started OK and the transmission works fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Lona&rsquo;s former owners for full 30 years is Dr Anthony Steel, who sailed Lona hard, and raced her out of Burnham. At age 92 now, Tony visited the restoration yard a number of times. &nbsp;And &ndash; importantly &ndash; he approves the new execution of his Lona III.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Austin and the Tradewind Yachts team!</p>","image_key":"8WfftD","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-rK33xDX/0/Th/i-rK33xDX-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel, Pitch pine on oak frames below the waterline, teak on oak above waterline","draft":1.6002,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":17.22,"head":14.27,"luff":21.36},"topsail":{"luff":24.47,"perpendicular":10.43},"length_overall":10.8204,"length_over_spars":12.7498,"fore_triangle_base":5.5687,"length_on_waterline":8.443},"hull_form":"cut_away_stem","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.8204,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Pain Clark designed 3 boats called Lona in the nineteen hundreds, and Lona III is his final take on the concept, and his favourite boat</p>","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00","website":"https://bartcarpentier.wixsite.com/Lona3","beam":2.3683,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"ec4aa381-8c1e-4af6-9a91-edab7287202c","designer":"f6deeaa8-366d-45d0-8dbc-e4f640b87b2e","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Clark J.
