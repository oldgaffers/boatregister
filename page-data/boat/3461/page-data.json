Knud Reimers was an apprentice of Henry Rasmussen and started designing yachts in his own practice from 1930  and designed his first 30 Sq.m in 1934. One of which (Water Witch) was built in Cowes by Uffa Fox. He was well known for his Metre and Square Metre rule boats, but his most famous design was the Tumlare.  Over the years Reimers developed his 30 Sq.m design culminating in his last one in 1972 - SWE 222 \u201cNatt och Dag\u201d. Aeolus is one of several (7?) built after Reimers death in 1986, by Jansson and Zarins in Koping, Sweden, to the lines of Natt och Dag. She is of composite construction \u2013 the hull is foam sandwich in epoxy and glass - the deck is cold moulded with a teak coachroof and cockpit.  Aeolus represents a significant stage in yacht design history and a pedigree in a class renowned for elegance and speed. In 2008 at the 100 year Jubilee regatta for Square meter yachts in Sweden, in the 30 Sq.m class (of 39 entries) Aeolus came 12th , SWE222 came 4th and SWE225 (one of the 7 sisterships of Aeolus) came 3rd overall.  It has been necessary to do significant repair work at Elephant boatyard which has rescued her from inevitable decline and she is now ready to provide elegant racing into the future.", "generic_type": "Yacht", "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Cowes", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "b2502db6-125d-41ba-8502-9b4e5fbedae7", "image_key": "HcBcfT", "length_on_deck": 12.192, "mainsail_type": "bermudan", "name": "Aeolus", "oga_no": 3461, "place_built": "Koping, Sweden", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "K21", "short_description": "Aeolus is one of several (7?) 30 Square Metres built after Reimers death in 1986, by Jansson and Zarins in Koping, Sweden, to the lines of his last 30Sq.m design Natt och Dag (1972).
