She was built without an engine, and appears on the Lloyds Register of Yachts until 1911 as a 9 ton cutter without motor propulsion.</p>\n<p>After the start of her unsuccesssful round the world cruise in 1934, still without an engine but now gaff schooner rigged, she was sold to an ice manufacturer in Plymouth. In 1938 her new owner renamed her Icicle IV and had installed a Thornycraft 'Handy Billy' petrol engine. During the war years she was preserved, being laid up afloat with 3\" of asphalt covering her decks.</p>\n<p>In 1954 she changed hands again and, after several years re-fitting in Plymouth, Tony Williams, his brother Trevor and family set off to France in 1959 finally arriving in St Tropez in the summer of 1961. Icicle IV remained in the Bay of Canubiers until purchased by her current owner, William MacInnes who changed her name back to SIF in 1988, registering her under the American flag.</p>\n<p>This owner undertook two programmes of restoration between 1985 and 2005, alongside taking part in Mediterranean races, and winning on several occasions. Since 2005, there has been no more major restoration, just regular maintenance and her owner asserts that, 'SIF is in sound shape and is well maintained, using products that permit the proverbial 'amateur' to care for this yacht, truly a 'one manâ€™s' boat! I am confident she will pass any survey desired!'</p>\n<p>After 29 years with her, she was put up for sale with <a href=\"http://www.woodenships.co.uk/sailing-yachts/historic-schooner/\" target=\"_blank\">yacht brokers Wooden Ships</a>.
