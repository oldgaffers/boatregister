Fitted from new with a wheel\nrather than a tiller and an engine \u2013 highly  unusual for the time\u00a0\u2013 <em>Boojum</em> was\na pioneer of sorts in blending tradition with innovation.</p>\n<p>Named after Lewis Carroll\u2019s fictitious character in Hunting of the Snark,\n<em>Boojum</em>  was commissioned by Buckley Haed.T W Bonnett of Basildon House, London\nwas also  one of her early owners followed in 1930 by J D MacGregor of Golder\u2019s\nGreen.</p>\n<p>H M Pinney of Hornchurch, Essex became the next registered owner keeping the\nvessel until 1955 when both B Farquharson and A Thompson of Devonshire Close,\nLondon took over ownership.</p>\n<p>In 1960 <em>Boojum</em> was sold to J K Hill of Hale, Cheshire, after which she was\nlaid-up in the river at Caernarfon and in 1966 looked shabby.</p>\n<p>Under Scottish ownership the vessel appears to have experienced mixed fortunes\nand eventually returned to the West Country in 2012. Since then countless hours\nwere dedicated to refitting the vessel and making her ready for family\nadventures. One of the first major jobs was restoring the cockpit \u2013 at some\npoint in her  long life, she had lost it altogether \u2013 and redoing all her frames\nand keel bolts,  ensuring she was structurally sound and ready for decades to\ncome.</p>\n<p>After cruising the West Country she took part in the 2021 Around The Island Race\nand Cowes Classic Week before sailing to Portugal for the 2025 season.</p>", "generic_type": ["Yacht", "Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.429, "draft": 1.829, "fore_triangle_base": 10.5, "fore_triangle_height": 10.5, "length_on_deck": 14.326, "length_on_waterline": 11.887, "length_over_all": 18.288, "main": {"foot": 8.001, "head": 6.501, "luff": 6.002}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 103.384, "thcf": 1.174}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "79c13b35-969a-47be-979a-c38600a0fa54", "image_key": "nr4F9t", "lastModified": "2025-11-12T15:57:41Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Boojum", "oga_no": 1216, "ownerships": [{"end": "2019", "name": "Justin Findlay", "share": 64, "start": 2012}, {"current": true, "id": 34847, "member": 6296, "share": "32", "start": "2019"}, {"current": true, "id": 34846, "member": 6296, "share": "32", "start": "2019"}], "place_built": "Falmouth", "reference": ["Gaffers Log Winter 2025, issue 119"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p><em>Boojum</em> is a true classic yacht, built on Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter lines.</p>", "updated_at": "2025-11-12", "year": 1909, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/1216"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
