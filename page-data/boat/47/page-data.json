She was used as a cockler after 1916 by W Loose of Brancaster Staith, who was coxswain of the Brancaster lifeboat. She carried cockles and mussels from the Wash to harbours along the Norfolk coast for 40 years.</p><p>She was heavily ballasted (5 tons), with no engine at first and carrying up to 8 tons. This proved to be too much for her light build so heavy sawn oak floors were added. Later her planking was doubled amidships. A foredeck was added and after the boat was nearly swamped in a SW gale side decks and hatches were added.</p><p>In November 1929, Mr Loose rescued two fishermen whose boat had sunk after hitting a submerged wreck in thick fog. Single-handed, he got both men into his dinghy and then on to 'Amity'. It is said his attention was drawn to oil in the water; he had an aversion to oil.</p><p>In 1940 'Amity' was sailed to Ramsgate to help in the evacuation of Dunkirk but was unsuitable for the operation so did not go. By the 1950s Mr Loose was an old man and 'Amity' fell into disuse.</p><p>In 1961 she was bought by Peter Croft and David Newborn who gave her a major refit. The old engine was replaced. John Loose, grandson of W Loose, was given 'Amity' by Peter Crofts in 1992.</p>","image_key":"cczRsL","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-3ncdhKh/0/Th/i-3ncdhKh-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"clinker","construction_details":"Clinker Oak on Steamed Oak Timbers","draft":1.0363,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":{"beam":3.3528407705437697,"draft":1.0363326018044379,"length_over_all":11.36917824920751,"length_on_waterline":11.36917824920751},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":11.369,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Amity was built as a 37ft Beach Tripper Boat and became a cockler.</p>","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00","website":"","beam":3.3528,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"fffdbf30-aada-401f-b89d-9232ed107ea8","designer":"0547b973-5c79-414d-9e46-17839bc0d336","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"clinker"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Chambers"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"unknown"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Chambers"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
