The Rivers Class differed from the working\nboats only in details of rig. The boom was longer and the sails were of cotton as\nopposed to tarred canvas, and they were rigged as sloops instead of cutters.</p>\n<p>Several of the class were built, possibly as many as 30, all named after rivers,\nMersea was the first (and the fastest) followed by Deva, Thames, Styx, Severn\netc. The Class was active up to about 1935, when it was disbanded. Several of\nthe Class went to join their working sisters in the pursuit of shrimps and\nprawns in Liverpool Bay and off North Wales. Others have ended up as Bermudan\nrigged sloops.</p>\n<p>Deva first appeared in Lloyds Register in 1914, owners NF Hall and JF Jellico.\nAfter the war she reappears belonging to Captain Bond, Liverpool and in 1926 was\nsold to the Earl of Derby. He lent her to the Royal Navy in the 1930s for the\ntraining of midshipmen on HMS Eaglet. From 1939 onwards, Deva was owned by 'mere\ncommoners'.</p>\n<p>Much of her original structure survived for the best part of a century, probably\ndue to regular maintenance and use. She has pitch pine planking on oak frames.</p>\n<p>Deva returned to racing for Tranmere Yacht Club in 1956. Her owner, Harry\nWilliams of Rock Ferry, a shipwright, redecked her and added a cabin. Deva was\nvery successful against modern competition. One of her more notable achievements\nwas gaining third place in the local Isle of Man midnight race against a\nNor`wester. Her owner locked his seasick crew below for 17 hours while he sailed\nthe race single-handed, or so the locals say.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this, Mr. Williams sold Deva to Mr. Wainwright and she was sunk in\nthe River Mersea by a dredger. After repairs, she was sailed in the Mersea and\non the North Wales coast, then through the canals via Wigan and Boston to\nRichmond. Her passage from Liverpool to Boston in eight days appears to be\nfastest recorded.</p>\n<p>Since being in the south, Deva has had a jackyard topsail added, and many\nimprovements have been made to her accommodation, In the 1970 OGA East Coast\nRace, she was the smallest of the five boats to complete the course, winning\nsecond prize in Class 2, and in 1971, she won the East Coast Old Gaffers Trophy,\ncoming second overall to Four Sisters.</p>\n<p>Re-decked with raised topsides by one plank, she was sold in 2008 from the\nestate of Jon Wainwright.</p>\n<p>In 2019 Deva was purchased by an 18 year old boat builder who started to restore\nher with a view to sailing in 2020.</p>", "generic_type": ["Lancashire Nobby"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.234, "draft": 0.914, "fore_triangle_base": 4.572, "fore_triangle_height": 5.486, "length_on_deck": 7.01, "length_on_waterline": 5.486, "length_over_all": 7.01, "main": {"foot": 3.658, "head": 3.658, "luff": 3.658}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 36.877, "thcf": 0.876117272, "topsail": {"luff": 3.353, "perpendicular": 2.134}}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "911f6d16-68af-43c2-a765-ee6136f0ec3a", "image_key": "2gfds4", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Deva", "oga_no": 268, "ownerships": [{"end": 2008, "name": "Jon Wainwright", "share": 64, "start": 1960}, {"current": true, "id": 1078, "member": 6331, "share": 64, "start": 2019}], "place_built": "Arnside", "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "268", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>*Deva's design and hull shape are typical of the 'advanced' design of Nobbys in\nthe pre-First World War era.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2024-10-10", "website": "https://tomcurtisboatbuilding.com/repair-and-restoration", "year": 1912, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/268"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
