Its purpose was to provide the crew with an opportunity to go sailing in boats other than the heavy service cutters and whalers. The gunter rig allowed the mast and sails to be stowed within the length of the hull itself, saving space aboard ship. Its heavy and sturdy clinker construction made it ideal for launching off a beach.&rdquot;<p>Samfire was restored by Andrew Matchett around 2003/2004. When he got her she had an improvised rig on a GP14 mast. He was looking into restoring her original gunter rig design but also looked at the Uffa Fox Bermudan racing rig with 25' mast and 10' boom.","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"clinker","construction_details":"Clinker Mahogany on Oak ribs","draft":null,"generic_type":"Dinghy","handicap_data":{"beam":1.6002194586686174,"length_over_all":4.26725188978298,"length_over_spars":4.26725188978298},"hull_form":"centre-board dinghy","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":4.2672,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"14' clinker dinghy used by the Royal Navy.","updated_at":"2021-03-23T08:43:27.29146+00:00","website":"","beam":1.6002,"air_draft":null,"reference":["Admiralty Manual of Seamanship BR67 VOL II"],"builder":"e5e9064b-773b-41d5-a642-a8a72bff5894","designer":"f97b2d74-8535-4ed5-8602-651d2ca2898f","design_class":"b8c7ec88-aa9a-4f0f-b002-ec982442c2b2","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"clinker"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"RNSA14"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Charles E.
