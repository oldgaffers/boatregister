Carrying on up to Worcester and into the River Avon &#39;Polly Garter&#39; settled into her smooring. Being too big for the river, really, with the mooring above the bridge over the M5, meant half lowering the mast for each trip down to Tewkesbury, to get under the M5! All good fun and her owner was very sad to sell here to a new owner at Milford Haven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is she called &#39;Polly Garter&#39;?
