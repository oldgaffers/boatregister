Owned by Mr Oliver for well over 30 years and spent long periods on the Algarve and in the Med. The boat was claimed as a gambling debt when Mr Oliver died and was shipped to Laurent Giles in Lymington for disposal. Mr J Snell bought her and kept her at Scarborough. He had the boat for approx. 10 years and then died. Michael Chamberlain found the boat in a barn in excellent condition, purchased her and cruised to the Med and the Algarve.
