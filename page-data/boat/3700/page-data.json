Bluebelle has the same hull shape as the Brian Kennell smacks boat but has a heavier GRP lay-up, a different internal layout and fit-out, and slightly smaller sail area. She has a balanced lug rig with a tan sail of clipper canvas made by James Lawrence and a new one of cream dacron made by Steve Hall of North Sea Sails. Both sails have two sets of reefing points. She has two mast positions and can be rigged as a gunter sloop. All the necessary fittings (shroud plates, jib sheet cleats and fairleads etc) are there. Sails well in all conditions but is an ideal heavy weather boat.</p>","image_key":"mHxLwW","uk_part1":"N/A","spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"single_sail","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"clinker","construction_details":null,"draft":0.838,"generic_type":null,"handicap_data":{"beam":1.524},"hull_form":"centre-boarder","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":3.734,"mainsail_type":"balanced_lug","short_description":"<p>Blue-hulled smacks boat which sits like a swan on the water.</p>","updated_at":"2022-07-04T07:37:31.181469+00:00","website":null,"beam":null,"air_draft":13,"reference":null,"ownerships":null,"builder":null,"designer":"f6e9f88a-6f88-40f7-82d2-e700bf57d1c5","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"clinker"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Alf Last"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"single_sail"},"genericTypeByGenericType":null,"builderByBuilder":null,"for_sale_state":null,"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
