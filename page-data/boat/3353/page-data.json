He rigged a low-aspect standing lug with a boom and a jib set on\nthe bowsprit. He sold it on to Tom Cregeen at Castletown, who later sold it on\nto Alex Merchant at Port St Mary IOM, who re-fitted it with a gaff rig. Alex\nsold it on to a chap who never went to sea and it fell into disrepair, abandoned\nashore. In late 2017, I bought the soggy wreck, having had my eye on it for some\ntime. I already have the gaffer Genesta II, which needs at least two and\npreferably three or four people to sail it, so the retirement plan was to put\ntogether a boat with a simple rig that could be sailed alone or short-handed\nwhen the weather permits.</p>\n<p>I like the look of the Romilly 22 mainsail and mast, so set about looking for a\nused mast and was lucky to find one in the NW of England. A pal brought it over\non top of his trailer yacht. Reading up on the Memory 19, it seems they need 500\nkgs of ballast. I thought that water ballast would be handy. Keeping the boat\nashore on its trailer, I could let it drain while towing up the slipway and\nreduce the 'shore' weight fast. There's 200 or so photos of this re-build on my\nFacebook page (set to public), among which, the ballast tanks each side of the\ncentre-board case can be seen. The 4-inch tubes let the tanks fill a or drain in\nabout 30 seconds. The ballast water level just kisses the under side of the\nsealed sole, which in turn is self-draining above for sailing purposes with\nbailers set in wells each side. It works very well, thankfully, as it was an\nexperiment from start to finish. As it happens, 600 kgs of ballast goes in,\nwhich makes the boat solid as a raft, almost doubling its dry weight of 750 kgs,\nincluding 60 kgs of lead chippings and resin let into the keel voids fore and\naft of the board case. The Whale gusher pump easily clears the water ballast in\nless than five minutes per side if necessary.</p>\n<p>For light airs, I thought the single standing lug might need a bit of help, so\ndecided to lengthen the existing sprit a couple of feet with the jib tacked\nwhere it was originally on a furler. \u00a0The assymetric kite is hauled out to the\nend of the sprit with a tackline in the usual manner. The sprit is also arranged\nto stand upright for use as a crane to hike the mast out of its tapered socket.</p>\n<p>There's no space under the sole to stash the outboard, so it lives on the\ntransom, however, this is often a blessing when trying to get through the Calf\nSound and the wind vanishes on you - quite a lot of currents around the IOM, so\nsafety-first! Haven't tested it yet but I suspect that it would self-right from\na knockdown. When ballasted, there's all that weight below the sole and plenty\nof buoyancy each side above the sole in the sealed fore and aft lockers/seats.\nOnce upright it's self-draining above the sole.</p>\n<p>Isle of Man Pleasure Craft Registry no. 1688</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.195, "draft": 0.457, "length_on_deck": 5.791, "length_on_waterline": 5.791}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Port St. Mary, Isle of Man", "hull_form": "centre-boarder", "id": "bda16439-f603-4d64-b7d0-7a0cce787e05", "image_key": "pmvPsG", "mainsail_type": "lug", "name": "Skian", "oga_no": 3353, "ownerships": [{"name": "Michael Kneale", "share": 64, "start": 2017}], "place_built": "Liverpool", "previous_names": ["Drean"], "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "3353", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Skian is an early Memory 19, purchased as a wreck in 2017, rebuilt as a lugger\nwith water ballast system, re-cycled Romilly 22 mast and new mainsail and jib,\nlaunched May 2018.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "year": 1975, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3353"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
