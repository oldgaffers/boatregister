His stricken 19th century yacht, &#39;Dunlin&#39;, was nearly 350 miles out in the Atlantic. Coastguards received a satellite signal from an emergency beacon 345 miles south-west of the Isles of Scilly. A Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft from RAF Kinloss, Scotland, was scrambled. The MV Sydney Express responded to an emergency call sent out by the coastguards, and picked up Mr. Kerin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;Dunlin&#39; had been well known in classic yacht circles as a regular at events in Antigua.
