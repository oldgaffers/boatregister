She carries a single French lug sail and interestingly has no centreboard, apparently the point being that these boats traditionally kept their bottoms &#39;fair&#39; so as to be run up beaches, as with the Beer beach boats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of having no plate, she sails well, although you need to have her moving when you want to come about. As she is quite narrow (approx 4&#39;3&#39;&#39; to her 12&#39;3&#39;&#39; LOA) John has introduced lead ballast below the floors and bolted inside the keel with the lead cast to the form of the clinker planking forming her bilges. There is about 50kg of lead cast in three sections and all three may be needed for single-handed sailing to avoid being too tender on the water. To compensate for the lead, she carries bouyancy bags.</p>", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.4234, "length_on_deck": 3.7338, "length_over_all": 3.733845403560107}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Instow", "id": "442eb1ed-01f1-45c1-a3ec-527c17a54301", "mainsail_type": "lug", "name": "Vera", "oga_no": 2833, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 555, "member": 4973, "share": 64, "start": 2009}], "place_built": "Bristol", "rig_type": "Sloop", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>&#39;Vera&#39; was built in 2004 by John Raymond-Barker (RB Boatbuilding, Underfall Yard, Bristol) and is pictured in the Classic Boat article of November 2006, where she is described as a Looe fishing boat.</p>", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 2004, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/2833"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
