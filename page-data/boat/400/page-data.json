Her owner was an Englishman, Gordon Emmerson, residing and working in Bermuda since 1945 who was Chief Engineer of the large and beautiful hotel, the Elbow Beach Surf Club in Paget, Bermuda. Gordon Emmerson fitted her out himself in Bermudan cedar. He and his wife, Beth, made at least two transatlantic voyages, sailing her to the Azores, Portugal, England and Ireland as well as in the West Indies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1971 Gordon Emmerson sold her to two medical gentlemen in Ireland, who also (?) made two Atlantic crossings and also sailed down through the West Indies before selling her,&nbsp;in 1976, to a Mr White&nbsp;based in Salcombe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1994, Mr and Mrs Bibra bought her, sailing mostly in the English Channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is built in the Colin Archer style with double-ended hull, long keel, length 34&rsquo; and 10&rsquo; beam. &#39;Marihona&#39; has a laid pine deck and solid Douglas fir mast (keel stepped), boom, gaff and bowsprit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006 she was purchased by Hans Jolivet, a French shipwright based in Falmouth. He has enjoyed some wonderful sailing onboard, her massive construction inspiring great confidence and her beauty and presence being a constant source of pleasure. Whilst the design was developed purely for the purpose of offshore cruising, without any regard for racing rules, she has a useful turn of speed and has featured in the prizes at OGA regattas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is a sister ship to &#39;Vixen&#39;, which did a circumnavigation of 38,000 miles without a hitch, and has completed a second &#39;lap of the globe&#39; <a href=\"https://www.oga.org.uk/ocean-gaffer-vixen\">in the hands of Bruce Halabisky</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, &#39;Marihona&#39; returned to Norway and is &#39;fitting out&#39; over the winter, hoping to return to the UK in 2019. Her skipper is seeking crew to join him on the passage, <a href=\"https://www.oga.org.uk/news/marihona-crew\">more details here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Interior images courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.red-ensign.com\" target=\"_blank\">Red Ensign Yacht Brokers</a>, Port Pendennis, Falmouth.</h4>","image_key":"PM5tqX","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":3.0480370641306997,"main":{"foot":5.919287978541819,"head":3.605827846866618,"luff":5.766886125335284},"thcf":0.993146243,"draft":1.5240185320653499,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":10.439526944647646,"fore_triangle_base":5.840039014874421,"length_on_waterline":9.75371860521824,"fore_triangle_height":8.662521336259449},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.4394,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Sister ship to &#39;Vixen&#39;, &#39;Marihona&#39; was built for blue water cruising and has undertaken several Atlantic crossings and voyages.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:38:41.244645+00:00","website":"","beam":3.048,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"63ae9d4e-f777-40ed-bd03-92155d42458b","designer":"f455f3b6-d2be-4793-a2d4-512398485aef","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"William Atkin"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Sauvika Battyggeri","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
