He sold her to Jay Cresswell (OGA member) in 1974, who re-registerd her for commercial fishing on the Beaumaris register (BS 120). Widely regarded in the nobby community as being a Fleetwood-build around 1920 because of her powerful bows and hefty build (for a nobby). She was an Irish Sea boat rather than nearshore model. Sold south in 1977 after three successful years of work, mostly in Scottish waters. New owner was Sam Bayliss (also OGA member).
