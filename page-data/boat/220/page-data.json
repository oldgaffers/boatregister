He sold her to Jay\nCresswell (OGA member) in 1974, who re-registerd her for commercial fishing on the\nBeaumaris register (BS 120). Widely regarded in the nobby community as being a Fleetwood-build\naround 1920 because of her powerful bows and hefty build (for a nobby). She was\nan Irish Sea boat rather than nearshore model.</p>\n<p>Sold south in 1977 after three successful\nyears of work, mostly in Scottish waters. New owner was Sam Bayliss (also OGA member).\nHe attempted to buy her back in the early 1980s through a proxy but failed. She\nhad a major refit 1996-9, and was for sale in 2004 - 2006</p>\n<p>It is possible that she was originally called 'Lizzie' though the name Venture reaches way\nback according to Nobby man, the late Ronnie Baines of Fiddler's Ferry, later\nDeganwy. His view was that she was originally a Fleetwood boat. Curiously, he too\nhad owned a nobby called Venture, but a different boat. There has been another Venture\nafloat and which fished the Morecambe Bay area. A grp hull modelled off the Sir William\nPriestley.</p>\n<p>The registration CO88 is a 'red herring'. The fishing Nobby CO88 was bought during the war\nby a company taking advantage of subsidies paid to the fishing industry. She was abandoned at\nthe end of the war in the Manchester Ship Canal. Venture recycled her sail. It was used as the pattern\nfor a new main, which was ordered from Fleetwood Trawler Supply Co. which still had a loft at that time.\nIt was a powerful yet manageable sail and enabled <em>Venture</em> to tow a beam trawl comfortably.</p>\n<p>The foresail had been made many years earlier, again for another nobby, but was\nlike new. The jib was made by Leitch of Tarbert using an earlier sail as the pattern/</p>", "generic_type": ["Lancashire Nobby", "Morecambe Bay Prawner"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.301, "draft": 1.4234, "fore_triangle_base": 7.528651548402828, "fore_triangle_height": 8.269324554986587, "length_on_deck": 10.415, "length_on_waterline": 9.421482565227993, "length_over_all": 10.40904657400634, "main": {"foot": 6.071689831748354, "head": 4.800658376005852, "luff": 4.343452816386247}, "propellor": {"type": "folding"}, "thcf": 1.012357744, "topsail": {"luff": 5.562667642038527, "perpendicular": 2.261643501584979}}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "7e90a9bb-f018-4c57-a7b8-74677db57477", "image_key": "SNzVsJ", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Venture", "oga_no": 220, "ownerships": [], "previous_names": ["Octaroon"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>She was originally a fishing Nobby in North west England.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-5MFS63F/0/Th/i-5MFS63F-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1899, "year_is_approximate": true}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/220"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
