Close examination of her photos and comparison with\nphotos of nobbys including <em>Lassie of Chester</em> suggest that she was built by\nJohn Crossfield at Conway. She has the same narrow sheer plank and rubbing\nstrake (moulding) as his fishing nobbys.\u00a0 Her high topsides for a fishing nobby,\nwidish cockpit and narrowish side decks (normally each 1/3 of the beam on a\nfishing nobby), iron guard rail stanchions and cross trees in 1974 suggest that\nshe was originally a yacht.</p>\n<p><em>Venture</em> was salvaged in 1965 by Dennis Crompton of Warrington, who gave her a\nmajor overhaul. He sold her to Jay Cresswell (OGA member) in 1974, who\nre-registered her for commercial fishing on the Beaumaris register (BS 120).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sold south in 1977 after three successful years of work, mostly in Scottish\nwaters. New owner was Sam Bayliss (also OGA member). He attempted to buy her\nback in the early 1980s through a proxy but failed. She had a major refit by\nRichard Coles (also OGA member) starting in 1984, including plank and a new\nengine installation. Richard and his daughter took her to the 1996 Brest IFOS.</p>\n<p>Her photo gallery includes an image of her wearing a sail with the Fishing\nRegistry CO88. Nobby CO88 was bought during the war by a company taking\nadvantage of subsidies paid to the fishing industry. She was abandoned at the\nend of the war in the Manchester Ship Canal. <em>Venture</em> recycled her sail even\nthough CO88 was a larger boat at 36' x 10'6\" x 6'.\u00a0 It was used as the pattern\nfor a new main, which was ordered from Fleetwood Trawler Supply Co. which still\nhad a loft at that time. It was a powerful yet manageable sail and enabled\n<em>Venture</em> to tow a beam trawl comfortably during her spell fishing as BS120.</p>\n<p>The foresail had been made many years earlier, again for another nobby, but was\nlike new. The jib was made by Leitch of Tarbert using an earlier sail as the\npattern.</p>", "generic_type": ["Lancashire Nobby", "Morecambe Bay Prawner"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.301, "draft": 1.423, "fore_triangle_base": 7.529, "fore_triangle_height": 8.269, "length_on_deck": 10.415, "length_on_waterline": 9.421, "length_over_all": 10.409, "main": {"foot": 6.072, "head": 4.801, "luff": 4.343}, "propellor": {"type": "folding"}, "thcf": 1.012357744, "topsail": {"luff": 5.563, "perpendicular": 2.262}}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "7e90a9bb-f018-4c57-a7b8-74677db57477", "image_key": "SNzVsJ", "lastModified": "2025-10-22T10:33:50Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Venture", "oga_no": 220, "previous_names": ["Octaroon"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>She was originally a fishing Nobby in North west England.</p>", "updated_at": "2026-01-06", "year": 1899, "year_is_approximate": true, "year_of_build": {"approx": true, "value": 1899}}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/220"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
