She served at HMS Ganges, Shotley, then moved to the Royal Hospital School in the mid 1970s, after Ganges station closed. She was used for training in a fleet of 10 RNSA 14&rsquo; dinghies. The RNSA fleet was sold in 1978-79 with at least eight boats going to a hire firm at Felixstowe. She was purchased from the Bosun and kept at the Colonel&rsquo;s hard on the Twizzle, which was later to become Titchmarsh Marina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RNSA&#39;s like Kingfisher are rare now.
