Many were burnt at Plymouth when the Navy turned to GRP Bosun dinghies in the 1970s.</p><p>If you are looking for a very stable, true classic dinghy of impeccable pedigree (the designers were Charles Nicholson and Uffa Fox, no less), consider our Kingfisher. She is ideal for Classic Festivals and&nbsp; has an amazing history - Chatham Dockyard-built (as was HMS Victory!) owned by the HMS Ganges and the Royal Hospital School, saved at the eleventh hour from a fate worse then death on a boating lake in Felixstowe and cared for&nbsp; by&nbsp; her previous owner (ex-Navy) in a way that would bring a smile to the face of the strictest Bosun. Totally original (except for standing and running rigging) and with superb bronze fittings that would make I K Brunel whistle. Peppered with crowsfeet and Chatham marks on every surface. Two suits of beautiful Egyptian cotton sails with Chatham sail loft marks, made in 1960\"s but in \"new\" condition, one suit probably unused.</p><p>We\"re not racers by nature but on the few occasions she has done it she shows most day boats a clean transom. However, we think Kingfisher is best suited to swanning about and looking beautifully antique. Although gunter rigged (makes road transport easier) she has the definite gaffer feel (two halyards).</p><p>Plus, if you fancy tapping into the revived interest in rowing, she offers 4 rowing positions - we have a pair of the original Admiralty pattern oars and bronze rowlocks.</p><p>She comes with an elderly, but serviceable, Snipe trailer and is viewable subject to appointment in the boatshed where she has been stored during our ownership.</p>", "seller_gold_id": null, "seller_member": null, "sold": null, "summary": null, "updated_at": "2020-05-03T10:13:13.204014+00:00"}], "full_description": "<p>Designed by Charles Nicholson and Uffa Fox, &#39;Kingfisher&#39; was built in the 1930s at Chatham Naval Dockyard, probably one of the last sailing vessels they ever built there.
