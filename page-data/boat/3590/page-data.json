The fleet grew quickly to\n17 and has raced regularly since then.</p>\n<p>In 1909 <em>Orchid</em> sailed from Hoylake to Ardrossan and on to Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p>14 boats of the Opera class remain today in Hoylake with another, <em>La Poupee</em>\non display in the Merseyside Maritime Museum.
