The gaff main and furling jib were new in\n2019 and have been lightly    used. Topsail and yard. The standing and running\n rigging are in good condition. Pair of leathered    wooden oars. Bilge pump.\n Tiller extension. Padded rudder bag. There are two covers: one over the    boom\n for \u201cin-use\u201d and a \u201cflat\u201d one for towing and storage ashore. Robust Hayling road\n trailer (new    wheel bearings 2022) with spare wheel.
