She was launched on 26<sup>th</sup> September 1991. After\nproving voyages between South West England and South West Ireland, she set out\non the Atlantic circuit in August 1992 \u2013 across the Bay of Biscay, down the\ncoasts of Spain and Portugal, and crossing to Bequia via the Canaries. After\nextensive Island Hopping via the Bahamas to the Florida coast, she followed the\nintra-coast waterway up the East coast of the USA, reaching Brooklin in Maine\nvia New York in September 1993. She re-crossed the Atlantic in 1995 and after a\nperiod of chartering in Ireland in 1998, was sailing back to Devon for sale. The\ncurrent owner purchased in 1999 and after cruising the English Channel and\nBrittany between 1999 and 2008, she underwent a major refit. In 2010 she\ncompleted a clockwise circuit of Great Britain via the Caledonian Canal. A\nfurther clockwise circuit was completed in 2013 visiting the Outer Hebrides,\nOrkney and Shetland.</p>\n<p>Major works have included a taller and stiffer mast with new standing rigging in\n2006, the new BETA engine in 2007 and the creation of the quarter berth and\nenlarged galley in 2009 with complete rewiring and new cushions/mattresses.
