The inspiration behind the design dates back from way before. The practicality of the open layout together with the shoal draft and centreplate has the traits of a Brightlingsea fishing smack, equally at home taking the ground at low tide or slipped onto a trailer. Since then over 150 Memories have been built and are now a well proven classic in their own right; safe, easily handled yet fast boats with numerous wins to their credit in OGA events.</p><p>The Memory has been fitted out in many different ways over the years but remain true to the original concept of simplicity and function. Built by Salterns Yachts their philosophy has been to use the very best of modern and traditional materials and craftsmanship, to give an uncomplicated yet beautiful boat of which any owner can be truly proud. The gaff rig is very practical and easy to use, the large sail area can be simply set, controlled and reefed from the large cockpit.<p>Designed originally as an &lsquo;open&rsquo; boat the accommodation is modest but practical, with two full sized berths and some storage in a vee formation in the snug little cabin under the foredeck.</p><p>The Memory has internal ballast, as her wooden ancestors. This is lead ingots contained within compartments on either side of the centreplate case. This is of course removable, making the Memory very light for manoeuvring on shore and at about one ton fully ballasted, including trailer, means she can easily be towed behind a substantial car or 4X4. The 50Kg centreplate is designed to fit under the cockpit sole, and is easily raised on it's own block and tackle.","image_key":"mZrG24","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":null,"draft":0.5334,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.13362594489149,"main":{"foot":4.57205559619605,"head":3.2004389173372347,"luff":3.8100463301633747},"thcf":0.848181605,"draft":0.5334064862228725,"topsail":{"luff":3.6576444769568397,"perpendicular":1.8288222384784198},"length_over_all":5.7912704218483295,"length_on_waterline":5.690685198732017},"hull_form":"centre-boarder","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.7912,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"&lsquo;Little Millie&rsquo; is a gaff-rigged GRP Memory 19 built in 1979.
