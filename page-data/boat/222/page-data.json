She is of traditional form\nwith a slightly raked stem, long keel, round bilge and elliptical counte stern.\nHer current owner, Steve Yates, fell in love with her counterstern when he found\nher on eBay, apparently for sale at The Suffolk Yacht Harbour, Levington in\n2005. After a year sailing on the East Coast and getting to know the local OGA\nmembers (Classic Boat #221), he planned a programme of winter maintenance but\nshe almost sank at her berth in January 2006. Following careful inspection rot\nwas discovered in the archboard and beam shelf. She had also suffered from\nover-enthusiastic re- fastening of the planks. Closer examination revealed the\nextent of the problems and she was declared a major project in May 2007.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ten years later, she emerged from her tent to be re-launched, 4 August, 2017 on\nthe banks of the River Deben at the Tidemill Yacht Harbour, Woodbridge.</p>\n<p>The restoration included a new ply deck, 90% new planking in larch, new\nsternpost, stem, rudder, bulwarks and replacement or sistering of most of her\nframes. Her bowsprit, featured in Tom Cunliffe\u2019s book \u2018Hand, Reef and Steer\u2019\n(first edition) was replaced and a new set of gaff jaws were crafted from the\nshattered remnants of the original and fitted to her gaff spar. The renowned\nsail loft, Ratsey &amp; Lapthorn, Isle of Wight was chosen to make her new suit of\nsails and her Yanmar auxiliary engine was fully reconditioned. New boards for\nthe sole and cockpit were crafted using some of the reclaimed teak deck. The\ninterior fit out was completed afloat between 2018 - 2022.</p>\n<p>As members of the OGA, there was plenty of local support during the restoration\nproject from the friendly, helpful membership on the East Coast, Netherlands and\nother parts of the UK and Ireland. During the summer months visiting yachtsmen,\nberth holders and OGA members called by to provide encouragement and to marvel\nat how much progress had been made \u2018since the last time we visited xx years\nago!\u2019</p>\n<p>For details about the launch, restoration and history of Cachalot, who was a\nDunkirk Little Ship, <a href=\"https://www.cachalot.org.uk\">visit her website</a>.</p>\n<p>The OGA Newsletter Editor, 1977, muses on the yacht \u2018Cachalot\u2019 as a preface to\npublishing a letter about her from new owner, Ian Kiloh.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the earlier 1960s a good looking 30' cutter\u2019s hull sat up at the top of Dixon\nKerly's yard at Maldon, quietly drying out and deteriorating. Occasionally there\nwas evidence that some work had been done on her, and in 1965 her then owner,\nDavid Garber was persuaded to join the OGA, and we looked forward to seeing her\nsailing. But it was not to be. In 1969 she was bought by David Robertson Hiner\nof Maldon, and things happened. David got her into sailing trim, and in 1970 he\nentered her for our East Coast Race, but she did not start. On the 16th\nSeptember that year, David sold her to Thomas Alexander Corbett, who owned her\nuntil the 9th February 1975, when she was sold to Andrew Ross Wheatley. On\nNovember 25th 1975, Ian Ferderick Kiloh bought her from Wheatley.</p>\n<p>Yes, my \u2018Cachalot\u2019, is indeed the same as owned by David and yes, we\u2019ve had a\nmajor task involving new carlins, doubling up the main beam (which was broken),\nnew covering boards, several new half beams, new bulwarks, hatches, cabin\ntrunking, interior, the list goes on, and on . . .</p>\n<p>However, the end is at least in sight and although we do not expect her to be\nreally A1 until next year we anticipate having our first sail in her in May this\nyear, all going to plan. She is a really lovely little yacht and has been well\nworth all the effort. My wife and I purchased her in November 1975 in Wivenhoe\nafter her having been sunk - and run over by a coaster!</p>\n<p>One interesting thing we have found is the original advertisement as placed in\nthe Yachtsman of October 1897 by her builder offering her up for sale.\nInterestingly she was \u2018almost \u2018completed\u2019 then, yet registered in 1904 as being\nbuilt in 1900. She appears in Lloyd's Register in 1902.</p>\n<p>Her first sails were by English, and purchased in 1902. We think that probably\nthe Boer War accounts for the anomolies. The builder/designer did in fact own a\ntimber yard - I think his claim of \u2018built of best materials\u2019 is the reason she\nis still around today as her last ten years or so seem to have treated her very\nunkindly. I would be most grateful for any information as to her earlier\nhistory; and I would be delighted if any OGA members have information on the\nefficiency of either Cascover sheathing or Admiralty \u2018Impetite\u2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>First published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter 1977/3</h4>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.048, "draft": 1.295, "fore_triangle_base": 5.639, "fore_triangle_height": 7.01, "length_on_deck": 8.534, "length_on_waterline": 6.858, "main": {"foot": 6.401, "head": 4.267, "luff": 5.182}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}, "solent": {"hull_shape": "Long keel - Standard", "measured_rating": 21.619680613629534, "thcf": 0.947}, "thcf": 0.925}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Woodbridge", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "5469ce0c-6a55-400f-acdb-f3f4481836f6", "image_key": "7w4vX9", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "mmsi": "232017185", "name": "Cachalot", "oga_no": 222, "ownerships": [{"end": 1905, "name": "W A Fraser, London", "share": 32, "start": 1900}, {"end": 1905, "name": "RC Boothby", "share": 32, "start": 1900}, {"end": 1928, "name": "B.
