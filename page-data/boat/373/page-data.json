At some point, probably in the 1920s, she was renamed &#39;White Heather&#39;. She had a mixed career of oyster dredging, racing and day sailing. An extensive restoration was carried out around 1960, including the fitting of an iron keel. After a change of owner in the late 1960s she was neglected, sunk by a paint float from Falmouth Docks and subsequently salvaged to Penryn Creek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1970 she was transported by road and ferry to Guernsey and got sailing again. From 1973 she was based at Ferrybridge, Portland Harbour, back under the name &#39;Little Apple&#39;. She was the first winner of the Edgar March memorial trophy. A feat repeated some years later. She was at the first Bucktrout and St Malo Rally in 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979 the cabin top was added. A further major refit took place in 1992.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.4292855401121676, "draft": 1.2710314557425018, "fore_triangle_base": 6.2881004633016335, "fore_triangle_height": 7.397585954645208, "length_on_waterline": 7.141550841258229, "length_over_all": 7.2787125091441105, "main": {"foot": 4.578151670324311, "head": 4.578151670324311, "luff": 4.398317483540599}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.930196292}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Emsworth", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "2f14a93f-3a50-44c2-8ccb-ca7bee7dc817", "image_key": "kncmmt", "length_on_deck": 7.2786, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Little Apple", "oga_no": 373, "ownerships": [{"note": "1920s - Owned by W.
