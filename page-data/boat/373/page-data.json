At some point, probably in the 1920s, she was renamed &#39;White Heather&#39;. She had a mixed career of oyster dredging, racing and day sailing. An extensive restoration was carried out around 1960, including the fitting of an iron keel. After a change of owner in the late 1960s she was neglected, sunk by a paint float from Falmouth Docks and subsequently salvaged to Penryn Creek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1970 she was transported by road and ferry to Guernsey and got sailing again. From 1973 she was based at Ferrybridge, Portland Harbour, back under the name &#39;Little Apple&#39;. She was the first winner of the Edgar March memorial trophy. A feat repeated some years later. She was at the first Bucktrout and St Malo Rally in 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979 the cabin top was added. A further major refit took place in 1992.</p>","image_key":"kncmmt","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel Pine on Oak timbers","draft":1.271,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.4292855401121676,"main":{"foot":4.578151670324311,"head":4.578151670324311,"luff":4.398317483540599},"thcf":0.930196292,"draft":1.2710314557425018,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":7.2787125091441105,"fore_triangle_base":6.2881004633016335,"length_on_waterline":7.141550841258229,"fore_triangle_height":7.397585954645208},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.2786,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:38:40.587177+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4293,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"fd9167a6-3932-4d99-b823-547d0bc541ef","designer":null,"design_class":"d5fbb324-f485-4bf8-87c6-c25df0929fe5","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Falmouth Oyster Boat"},"designerByDesigner":null,"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Paynters","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
