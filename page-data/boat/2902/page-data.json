She&nbsp;has larch planking on steamed oak frames, teak decks, copper nails and silicon bronze keel bolts with a 1.2 tonne lead keel. The little Faversham solid fuel&nbsp;stove and Colin Freake blocks everywhere&nbsp;complete the journey back in time. She is powered by a fine Beta Marine 20hp engine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ivan Godley bought her from her previous owner of seven years, Cormac Levis, the traditional boat historian and author of the book &#39;Towelsail Yawls&#39; which is a history of the traditional lobster boats of west Cork and a cracking good read!
