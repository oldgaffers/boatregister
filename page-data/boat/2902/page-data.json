She&nbsp;has larch planking on steamed oak frames, teak decks, copper nails and silicon bronze keel bolts with a 1.2 tonne lead keel. The little Faversham solid fuel&nbsp;stove and Colin Freake blocks everywhere&nbsp;complete the journey back in time. She is powered by a fine Beta Marine 20hp engine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ivan Godley bought her from her previous owner of seven years, Cormac Levis, the traditional boat historian and author of the book &#39;Towelsail Yawls&#39; which is a history of the traditional lobster boats of west Cork and a cracking good read! If you can get a copy on Amazon, it&#39;s a worthwhile&nbsp;buy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After buying Frolic in October&nbsp;2013 she&nbsp;spent the winter in Whoolies Yard, west Cork where she had a refit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was re-launched&nbsp; on 7 April 2014 and sailed the 140 miles home to Fenit, north Kerry.
