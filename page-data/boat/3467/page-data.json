These are quite conservative ratings, dictated by current regulations about the amount of buoyancy built in rather than actual hull volume (20 years ago she would probably have sold as a four-adult rowing boat).<p>She has a full length keel and deep skeg (an extra bit of keel at the stern), which, combined with the long waterline, means she tracks beautifully under oars. She carries her way through a fair chop and doesn\u2019t get blown off course in the first gust; if you have only ever tried rowing an inflatable, you will find this almost incomparably better! Oars included.<p>This one is the high-spec version with navy blue \u201csheer strake\u201d (top two planks), cream interior, teak decking on the buoyancy tanks, rubber fendering and sailing rig.<p>As Watercraft magazine found, probably the most comfortable place to sit is on the floor, but you could also sit higher, on the centre thwart, or the seat that spans the stern tanks.<p>The hull shape makes her highly resistant to heeling for a 9' dinghy; she inspires confidence and (whilst not a racing machine) is very enjoyable to sail.
