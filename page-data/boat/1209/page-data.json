Thus a shortened course was ordered, and a delayed start arranged - we wanted to digest Sunday lunch befor facing that lot! Staggered starts were arranged, the slower boats off first, speedier gaffers like &#39;Chittabob IV&#39; an hour later.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Trememdous speeds were made down to the Couch entrance but with the wind gusting to Force 7, some of us wished we had tucked two reefs in instead of one! Of the twenty boats racing we had five retirements, but no damage done. The southwesterly wind gave long legs up the river on the beat back, enabling some pretty smart windward sailing along lee shores to take place. Big boats like &#39;Noordezon&#39; and &#39;Gracie&#39; really lapped up the weather, but the dart like race &#39;Elaine&#39;, setting&nbsp; self-tacking foresail on a boom yankee style also went well, as did the little &#39;Pelican&#39; setting a mainsail off the champion gaffer &#39;Jade&#39;.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>As the fleet raced up the Crouch, low water spring tides laid snares for the unwary - &#39;Deva&#39;, having eased the sides of the channel twice previously grounded a third time unlucky within sight of the finish. Which makes &#39;Norderzon&#39;s&#39; victory all the more notewothy, with her deep draft. Cretainly she was a magnificane sight for us as she ploughed upriver, and a magnificent boat for the day.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>28 September 1996 Maldon OGA Anniversary Rally &amp; Town Regatta when &#39;Hardy&#39; took line honours and the Bright Trophy, ahead of &#39;Noorderzon&#39; and &#39;Spellbound&#39;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>first published in the OGA Gaffers Log, March 1997</h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It was blowing fresh from the west with a gale on its way. Even so there was still a substantial fleet of great interest. In the cruisers we had craft ranging from under 20 ft. such as the yole &#39;Hequend&#39;, to the mighty steel &#39;Noorderzon&#39;, a pilot cutter with Fastnet tendencies! Classic yachts range from the French 7.5 metre &#39;Sheena&#39; and the ECOD &#39;Chittabob&#39; to the magnificent 50 ft. Summers &amp; Payne &#39;Hardy&#39;. Smacks were of course well represented, as the race was also the traditional Town Regatta course of 1952.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The first part of the course was out to Mersea Mo. 1 buoy before cutting across to the Bradwell shore and up the river. The downwind start gave a fairly congested rounding of the leeward mark, befor the slog up the river. The wind over tide made it hearv going for the little vessels and all the smacks were having to reef once if not twice. Because the big boats were so early on the tide, additional legs had to be inserted in the course for the tide to make sufficiently at Hythe Quay. Stansgate Narrows in a small boat is nasty enough to go through once in fresh winds, and four times was too much for some. Great skills were needed for the big boats too, as they beat up the narrow channel through th moornigns to finish in front of the spectators lining Hythe Quay at Maldon. Great skill was needed too, to hand sail in that wind before the bridge was breached!</blockquote>","image_key":"Df9g6W","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"steel","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":1.8288,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":4.419653742989515,"draft":1.8288222384784198,"length_over_all":12.801755669348939,"length_on_waterline":11.582540843696659},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":12.8016,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>The steel cutter, Noorderzon, was built in the Netherlands, 1979.
