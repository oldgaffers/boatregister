Her new owner added a doghouse, and reduced\u00a0the length of\nher bowsprit, but he was obviously pleased with her as he replaced her original\nW.D.Fair petrol engine with a new Stuart Turner in 1948 and\u00a0kept her until 1954.</p>\n<p>Her next\u00a0owner Edwin Ker sailed Crystal single handed back to Scotland via the\nForth and Clyde Canal\u00a0and kept her first at Rothesay, then Tighnabruich, and\nlatterly at Oban. He sailed her for long periods each summer from 1957 to the\nmid 1970s, going\u00a0as far north as Stornaway, and habitually\u00a0sailed\u00a0round Kintyre\nrather than through the Crinan Canal. He\u00a0preferred not to use the engine and\u00a0in\nearly days he often sailed alone, but latterly with various crew, either friends\nor undergraduated found for him by various means. One regular source of crew was\nhis friend Sir Charles Evans, principal of University College of North Wales,\nBangor. Crystal was also lent out to friends from the UK and Vancouver where her\nowner\u00a0had spent time between the wars.</p>\n<p>Crystal was based for most of this time at Jimmy Smith's Yard at Tighnabruich,\nbut after the yard closed in the mid 1970s Crystal was moved to Oban, where she\nhad a mooring on the Brandy Stone moorings in the Sound of Kerrera. Edwin was in\nhis 80s at this point and Crystal's standard of maintenance declined with some\nof her equipment (including her stay sail) being lost or stolen. Latterly\nCrystal was only rigged briefly each summer so friends and family could use her.</p>\n<p>After Edwin Ker's death in 1980 Crystal was sold to two\u00a0of her old \"student\"\ncrew, and she moved to South Shian, Argyll. Her Stuart\u00a0Turner engine was\nreplaced by a Yanmar in\u00a01994, and her original, and now leaking, teak decks were\nreplaced with glassed ply.</p>\n<p>Eventually maintaining a wooden boat proved too much, and Crystal was sold\nagain. She was brought\u00a0back to Essex on a road trailer and underwent\na\u00a0renovation which may have seen her with a new mast and certainly saw\nthe\u00a0removal of\u00a0her 1930's doghouse. After sailing her for a few years she was\nput up for sale in 2002.</p>\n<p>Her next owner seems to have got a lot of\u00a0use out of her, but we have no\nreliable information about this stage in her life and she passed into the\nownership of\u00a0Ivan Maskell who\u00a0spent many years restoring her once again.\u00a0He\nunfortunately died before finishing the work but enough had been done to show\nwhat a superb yacht she was, and the work was completed by a new owner in 2018,\nand she is now being sailed out of Bembridge IOW.</p>\n<p>Although initally a \"one off\" design, Crystal II now has a sister ship,\nDaydream, constructed using traditional methods in America in 2016.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.591, "displacement": 4980, "draft": 1.295, "length_on_deck": 9.296, "length_on_waterline": 6.706, "length_over_all": 9.296513045598633, "propellor": {"type": "feathering"}, "sailarea": 40.713, "solent": {"hull_shape": "Long keel - Standard", "measured_rating": 22.578508568794543, "performance_factor": " ", "thcf": 0.964}, "thcf": 0.947}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Bembridge IOW", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "18fee80e-da6e-41f8-95c3-0f45cbcd6a3f", "image_key": "382NCP", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Crystal II", "oga_no": 3432, "ownerships": [{"end": 1933, "note": "1927-1933 David Anderson, based at Rochester", "share": 64, "start": 1927, "text": "David Anderson, based at Rochester"}, {"end": 1954, "note": "1934-1954 T.H.Seaton, based at Burnham on Crouch", "share": 64, "start": 1934, "text": "T.H.Seaton, based at Burnham on Crouch"}, {"end": 1981, "note": "1954-1981 Edwin Kerr, ", "share": 64, "start": 1954, "text": "Edwin Kerr,"}, {"end": 1996, "note": "1981-1996?
