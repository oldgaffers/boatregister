For his first summer afloat,&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;took Tramontana&nbsp;up the Thames to Tower Bridge, and along the English Channel as far as Elderberry Cove in Torbay, where he anchored for a week, before returning to Ipswich. The following summer, 2014, Martin again headed west along the English Channel but this time on a one way trip, ending up in Penarth Marina, Cardiff. Along the way he met up with eight other Harrison Butler boats in the Solent, took part in Plymouth&#39;s Classic Boat Regatta, and called into The Isles of Scilly. The 2015 cruise saw Tramontana&nbsp;head north to Fort William, then back south to Conwy. A new engine was installed in 2016. The summers of 2017, 2018 and 2019 have seen Tramontana cruising&nbsp;the Irish Sea and Southern Ireland.&nbsp;Martin hopes to explore Northern Ireland and the Clyde in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Built in 1934, renamed in 1953</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Staley, boatbuilder with Anderson, Ridgen &amp; Perkins, has been in touch to say that &#39;Morena&#39;, as she was then, was built at a total cost of &pound;1,370 6s 1d. A dinghy was built as a tender to go with her for &pound;27 9s 6d. The Lloyd&#39;s survey for the Register of Shipping was carried out on 16 May 1934. &#39;Morena&#39; was renamed &#39;Tramontana&#39; in 1953. In the same year, she was in Thomas&#39;s yard Falmouth for alterations to her accommodation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about &#39;Tramontana&#39; on the <a href=\"http://www.harrisonbutlerassociation.com/PhotoArchive/Tramontana/Article0046.html\" target=\"_blank\">Harrison Butler Association website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image_key":"krBnwf","uk_part1":"163480","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Pitch pine below waterline, lighter pine above.
