She has spent her life sailing from Anglesey, or trailer sailed with her Bramber Breakback trailer. (Fully Serviced Oct 20, with new hitch/brake coupling fitted.  She also has a specially designed, unbraked launching trailer available separately. Her shallow draft of 18inches, keel up, has allowed many peaceful explorations of river and coastal creeks, and her retro-fitted mast raiser comes into its own, for popping under bridges.  She is intended for sailing single handed or as a couple, and her well designed compact cabin, with hob and porta-loo provides 2 berths. Her surprisingly spacious cockpit allows up to 6 people to enjoy a day afloat, under sail or motor. She has been both day sailed or from a mooring, but always wintered ashore under full cover. Presently on hard standing ready to view. Full details and more pictures available on Apollo Duck.
