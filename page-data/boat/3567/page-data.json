The\nPicarooner is a sturdy and well-built seaworthy 16\u2019 gaff rig sailing dayboat,\nbased on the old wooden fishing boats that sailed out of Clovelly to fish for\nthe local \u2018silver darlings\u2019 or herring. The original mould was taken from one of\nthese old lug-rigged sailing boats, and the rig converted to the more popular\ngaff rig and steel centreplate, for this GRP version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She was brought from the West Country to Waldringfield on the River Deben and\nlives off the Maybush Pub. Her range is normally to one of the four other pubs\non the River Deben for which there is convenient landing. I am grateful to the\nECOGA who have inspired me and especially the husband of ECOGA Minutes Secretary\nwho has helped maintain \u2018Agnes Jayne\u2019, mending broken gaff jaws, replacing a\nbroken bowsprit and making a new tiller.</p>", "generic_type": "Dayboat", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.829, "draft": 0.914, "fore_triangle_base": 1.6, "fore_triangle_height": 3.719, "length_on_deck": 4.724, "length_on_waterline": 4.724, "main": {"foot": 3.021, "head": 2.438, "luff": 2.073}, "propellor": {"blades": 2, "type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.767}, "home_country": "UK", "home_port": "Waldringfield, River Deben, Suffolk", "hull_form": "centre-board dinghy", "image_key": "jBRVVQ", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Agnes Jayne", "oga_no": 3567, "place_built": "Mylor Bridge", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "CP 26", "short_description": "<p>\u2018Agnes Jayne\u2019 is a Gaffers &amp; Luggers Clovelly Picarooner.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3567"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
