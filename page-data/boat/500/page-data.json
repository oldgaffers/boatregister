She &nbsp;remained in Burnham until at least 1980. She was placed on the OGA register in 1999 by her owner at the time, who kept her at Chichester, but when he sold her in 2008 she went to Wales.</p>\n<p>She lay abandoned in a boat yard there until 2018, when she was bought with the intention of turning her into a \"Glamping Pod\".
