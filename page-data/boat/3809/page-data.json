They would\noften travel up and down the coast building boats on the beach for people, and\nit is said that they would produce a boat in six weeks, using timber sourced\nnear the site and with only 6-7 men. These boats are called Nobbys, which is a\ncolloquial word for rough wood, but they are identifiable by their sleek lines,\nlow freeboard and beautiful counter stern. They are also called Prawners as that\nwas the catch for subsistence fishermen and they were built for speed to get the\ncatch back to harbour and achieve the best price for the freshest fish. Their\nlow freeboard allowed the men to haul in the nets, with their bare hands, just\nusing the roll of the boat in the sea. They only had the use of their sails,\nwith topsails for light winds, to get home, as engines were not fitted until the\n1930\u2019s.  </p>\n<p>\u200bBefore arriving at Conwy, the boat was previously owned by the Roddick family\nwho are great enthusiasts of the Nobby class boat.\u00a0 They have generously donated\nthe boat to the Community of Conwy in memory of Jamie Roddick who tragically\ndied of cancer at the age of 34.<br />\n<em>Helen II</em> was constructed for George E Stonall of New Brighton.\u00a0 She is 40 feet\nlong and of oak frame and pitch pine construction.\u00a0 As well as being a working\nboat, she also has a long history of successful racing awards. In 1914, she was\nthe RMYA regatta winner in the fishing boat class and in 1920, the winner of the\nLiverpool Yacht club regatta. In the December 1930, the Helen II went missing as\na result of a storm in Liverpool bay.\u00a0 She was eventually rescued from the\nQueens channel, with the help of a New Brighton lifeboat and was subsequently\npurchased by Ludwick Anderson of Port Maddog. She spent the next 10 years in\nwaters off the welsh coast, around\u00a0 Port Maddog and Bangor.\u00a0 In 1943, she was\npurchased by Jackie Martin of Fleetwood and worked off the Lancashire coast\nunder various owners until 1999 when she was acquired by the Community of Conwy.</p>", "generic_type": ["Lancashire Nobby"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.438, "draft": 1.372, "length_on_deck": 9.144, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "home_country": "Conwy harbour", "home_port": "Conwy harbour", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "image_key": "bjX3Mm", "lastModified": "2026-02-28T14:36:50Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Helen 2 of Conwy", "oga_no": 3809, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "name": "Community of Conwy", "share": 64, "start": "1999"}], "rig_type": "Other", "short_description": "<p>Info on Helen 2 can be found on her website\u00a0\u00a0<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.helennobbyproject.co.uk/\">helen 11 - Home</a></p>", "updated_at": "2026-02-28", "website": "http://www.helennobbyproject.co.uk/", "year": 1910, "year_of_build": {"value": 1910}}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3809"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
