She was originally fitted with a single cylinder Dan paraffin engine developing 28hp and attained 6 knots on trials, sufficient for her intended work over the oyster layings in the Rivers Crouch and Roach, which are sheltered waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dan engines were in 1908 a well-known make for marine work and the first was installed in 1895. These operated on paraffin and by 1907 about 1500 had been installed in fishing and commercial craft. The company located at Ipswich and also offered to build craft for clients. They were producing a diesel engine by 1912. It is possible that Speedwell was designed by Linton Hope and Co. naval architects of London as they were in 1908 suppliers of Dan engines and designed numbers of motor and auxiliary fishing vessels as well as yachts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1908 Burnham-on-Crouch and most other coastal communities in Britain and elsewhere were familiar with auxiliary and full power motor driven craft, yachts and commercial vessels and had great interest in their efficiency, costs and development. The introduction of the reliable paraffin, petrol, petrol/paraffin, diesel and semi-diesel marine engine was the greatest advance ever offered to those earning their living afloat in sailing fishing and coasting vessels, whatever romantics may think. It offered them independence from calms and to some extent from contrary tides and introduced the possibility of some regularity of landings or delivery of cargoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham men were as well acquainted with this as any for the British Motor Boat Club held their annual racing meet there after the first in 1904, where some advanced boats competed and auxiliary and full power motor yachts were regularly using the anchorage from that time in increasing numbers and no doubt attracted keen interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There had previously been and contemporarily were several steam oyster dredgers working from Burnham, besides a number of sailing smacks from there and Paglesham. The decision to build a motor dredger was logical in the climate of that time when the marine internal combustion engine was advancing rapidly and was already well accepted in working small craft and yachts because of its economy and convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speedwell&#39;s first cost was just over half that of a comparable steam dredger and the manning expenses were less. Her crew was three men, of whom one was engineer. As far as can be discovered, and photographs confirm, Speedwell was built without a rig. She had a clipper bow and a very short and light bowsprit for appearance and to balance her counter stern in profile. She was steered with a tiller, had a prominent coachroof over the engine room and a large cowl ventilator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her principal dimensions were 50ft x 12ft 9ins moulded breadth x 5ft 9ins depth moulded. She carried 12 tons of ballast to achieve an acceptable draught for dredging purposes. It seems unlikely she was ever subsequently rigged as a cutter and her full form had almost no resemblance to that of the typical Essex smack. It&#39;s unknown when she was rigged, but it was probably when she was sold to owners in Kent, where her low power engine would have made her impracticable as a purely motor craft for work in the most exposed coastal waters. This no doubt led to her being re-engined with a 25-30hp 2 cylinder Kelvin engine which gave 7 knots in smooth water, when owned by the Seesalter and Ham Oyster Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was later rigged as a ketch, without a topmast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owner Simon Knight moved to New Zealand, leaving the boat in Shoreham, when she was bought by Suzi Walker in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simon Knight, Speedwell&#39;s previous owner, made contact in Dec 2017 having seen Speedwell on the website. he writes: <em>I have been on the OGA web site and saw her entry in the boat registry and felt that I must contact you as there is&nbsp; an entry by Keith Allso which is not altogether correct. He as many others has got her date of build wrong, should be 1901. She was not built for the Smith Bros but probably built for an American. He also got her dimensions wrong, she is 52ft long and 14ft 6in beam. On the engine details again he is wrong, the replacement Kelvin engine was Petrol/Diesel 44HP giving upto 8knots. I cruised at 7Knots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe has actually got the wrong Speedwell, there were two in Whitstable and nearly every writer has got them mixed. I found her true history when I took Speedwell to Whitstable and the East coast where I met the Skipper and crew who worked her out of Whitstable. I also met David Patients who has the designers half model where it clearly states her name,&nbsp; designers name, William King of Burnham-on-Crouch dated 1901 and other details. The half model shows her propeller opening which makes Speedwell the first boat in the UK to be purposefully built for a marine spirt engine as noted else where in her history. From this list and other East coast trips I was given photos of Speedwells launch in 1901 plus many of her working.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that the measurements he mentions are recorded under the measurement section - resumably given by him when he owned the boat.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 4.2672, "draft": 1.8288, "fore_triangle_base": 9.244696415508411, "fore_triangle_height": 12.091563033406485, "length_on_deck": 15.8496, "length_on_waterline": 13.106559375762009, "length_over_all": 15.849792733479639, "main": {"foot": 6.3246769080712015, "head": 5.7912704218483295, "luff": 10.515727871250913}, "mizzen": {"foot": 3.6576444769568397, "head": 2.691416727627408, "luff": 3.8100463301633747}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 1.152531385, "topsail": {"luff": 6.0960741282613995, "perpendicular": 8.686905632772493}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Shoreham", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "03550e49-4038-44e8-81ec-bc36c40de645", "image_key": "DhXqNW", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Speedwell", "oga_no": 547, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 491, "member": 4686, "share": 64, "start": 2006}], "place_built": "Burnham-on-Crouch", "rig_type": "Ketch", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Originally built as a motor oyster dredger for use on the East Coast rivers, &#39;Speedwell&#39; is now rigged as a ketch and sails on the Solent.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Dnpbgdv/0/Th/i-Dnpbgdv-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1908, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/547"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
