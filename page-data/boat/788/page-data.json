She is a sturdy little pocket cruiser in very good sound condition having had much work done  to her over the years. The sails are excellent and set very well. The engine is a  Volvo 10hp which has been utterly reliable and very economcal. A new sump pan and engine mounts were fitted in 2017. The rigging is galvanised wire and sound with running rigging and blocks replaced around 2010.\r\n\r\nDown below there are two full length berths with room for one in the fo'c'sle.  To port is a two burner Origo meths stove. To starboard there is a hanging locker. 'Inanda' sails really well for her size and has competed successfully in local OGA races.","image_key":"DRP9cB","uk_part1":"182788","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel, mahogany and pitch pine on oak","draft":1.0668,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.13362594489149,"main":{"foot":4.754937820043891,"head":4.038649109973177,"luff":3.886247256766642},"thcf":0.888908785,"draft":1.066812972445745,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":6.858083394294074,"fore_triangle_base":3.9624481833699097,"length_on_waterline":5.7912704218483295,"fore_triangle_height":6.2484759814679345},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.858,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Inanda is a Deben four-tonner, built at Woodbridge in 1949.</p>","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:38:52.34292+00:00","website":"","beam":2.1336,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"0eb139e6-d991-4c98-90d0-b917c91e12c0","designer":"7be4728c-aec1-4b98-9245-33fa05964add","design_class":"e1b81706-7e46-47fe-ab3e-d03afcb552ce","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Deben 4 Ton"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"William Maxwell Blake"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Whisstocks Boatyard Ltd"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":3000}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
