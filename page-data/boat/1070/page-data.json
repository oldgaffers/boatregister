By the 1960s\nshe was in poor condition and Alan Savage carried out extensive work, including\nreplanking the topsides. When the Pridie family bought her the bottom leaked\nlike a sieve, the decks were in a poor state and the mast needed serious attention.\nThe Pridie family enjoyed several years of sailing, patching the bottom as necessary.\nOriginally the hull had been bronze fastened but a previous owner had replaced\nsome planks with ungalvanised nails which caused a reaction with the bronze.</p>\n<p>On a return trip from the Scilly Islands a friend mistook a Channel buoy for something\nelse and the subsequent collision broke the bowsprit, split the stem and the topmast\ncame down. They kept the boat afloat for six hours before being towed into Padstow by\nthe lifeboat. Here they met a shipwright, Nimrod Bawden, who fitted a new stem and replaced\nthe planking surrounding it.</p>\n<p>The Pridies decided to replank the bottom and by 1981 a fair bit had been replaced.\n<em>Peggy</em> competed in the OGA Race at Dartmouth but on the return to Bristol disaster hit\nagain when they sat on a pile and punched a hole in the hull. She was salvaged and it was\nrealised that <em>Peggy</em> needed a major refit.</p>\n<p>The boat was replanked and the deck beams replaced. In 1985 she was refloated and the\nfollowing winter the deck was replanked. Much of the deck furniture had been salvaged\nand reused. A new hollow Noble mast and spars were added with new sails.</p>\n<p>Originally <em>Peggy</em> would not have had an engine, however she had acquired one of of\ndubious age and this was replaced with a similar one that had been a stand by generator.\nIt was marinised together with a second hand gearbox. She was back sailing in 1986.</p>", "generic_type": "Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.871, "draft": 2.286, "fore_triangle_base": 8.686905632772493, "fore_triangle_height": 10.820531577663983, "length_on_deck": 13.8379, "length_on_waterline": 12.344550109729333, "length_over_all": 13.838088271153376, "main": {"foot": 8.53450377956596, "head": 6.858083394294074, "luff": 8.22970007315289}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 127.34653726326762, "thcf": 1.131, "topsail": {"luff": 6.9342843208973415, "perpendicular": 3.3528407705437697}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Bristol", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "c9c2f2cb-cb12-47f5-8bb6-71849a17babe", "image_key": "WmB85k", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Peggy", "oga_no": 1070, "ownerships": [{"end": 1973, "name": "Alan Savage", "share": 64}, {"end": 2018, "name": "Diccon Pridie", "share": 32, "start": 1973}, {"end": 2018, "name": "Mark Pridie", "share": 32, "start": 1973}, {"name": "John Potter", "share": 32, "start": 2018}, {"name": "Rachel Haynes", "share": 32, "start": 2018}], "place_built": "Pill", "previous_names": ["The Wave"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Originally called <em>The Wave</em>, Peggy is a Bristol Channel\nPilot Cutter, built for pilot Arthur Case at Pill in 1903 by Edwin Rowles.
