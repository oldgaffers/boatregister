By the 1960s\nshe was in poor condition and Alan Savage carried out extensive work, including\nreplanking the topsides. When the Pridie family bought her the bottom leaked\nlike a sieve, the decks were in a poor state and the mast needed serious\nattention. The Pridie family enjoyed several years of sailing, patching the\nbottom as necessary. Originally the hull had been bronze fastened but a previous\nowner had replaced some planks with ungalvanised nails which caused a reaction\nwith the bronze.</p>\n<p>On a return trip from the Scilly Islands a friend mistook a Channel buoy for\nsomething else and the subsequent collision broke the bowsprit, split the stem\nand the topmast came down. They kept the boat afloat for six hours before being\ntowed into Padstow by the lifeboat. Here they met a shipwright, Nimrod Bawden,\nwho fitted a new stem and replaced the planking surrounding it.</p>\n<p>The Pridies decided to replank the bottom and by 1981 a fair bit had been\nreplaced. <em>Peggy</em> competed in the OGA Race at Dartmouth but on the return to\nBristol disaster hit again when they sat on a pile and punched a hole in the\nhull. She was salvaged and it was realised that <em>Peggy</em> needed a major refit.</p>\n<p>The boat was replanked and the deck beams replaced. In 1985 she was refloated\nand the following winter the deck was replanked. Much of the deck furniture had\nbeen salvaged and reused. A new hollow Noble mast and spars were added with new\nsails.</p>\n<p>Originally <em>Peggy</em> would not have had an engine, however she had acquired one of\nof dubious age and this was replaced with a similar one that had been a stand by\ngenerator. It was marinised together with a second hand gearbox. She was back\nsailing in 1986.</p>", "generic_type": ["Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.871, "draft": 2.286, "fore_triangle_base": 8.687, "fore_triangle_height": 10.82, "length_on_deck": 13.838, "length_on_waterline": 12.344, "length_over_all": 13.838, "main": {"foot": 8.534, "head": 6.858, "luff": 8.23}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 127.347, "thcf": 1.131, "topsail": {"luff": 6.934, "perpendicular": 3.353}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Bristol", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "c9c2f2cb-cb12-47f5-8bb6-71849a17babe", "image_key": "WmB85k", "lastModified": "2025-11-13T07:37:26Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Peggy", "oga_no": 1070, "ownerships": [{"end": 1973, "name": "Alan Savage", "share": 64}, {"end": 2018, "name": "Diccon Pridie", "share": 32, "start": 1973}, {"end": 2018, "name": "Mark Pridie", "share": 32, "start": 1973}, {"name": "John Potter", "share": 32, "start": 2018}, {"name": "Rachel Haynes", "share": 32, "start": 2018}], "place_built": "Pill", "previous_names": ["The Wave"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Originally called <em>The Wave</em>, Peggy is a Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter, built for\npilot Arthur Case at Pill in 1903 by Edwin Rowles.
