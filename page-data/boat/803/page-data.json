His earlier passage was in another boat named &#39;Odd Times&#39;, designed by John Leather and built for him in 1958. He sailed her from his native Essex coast to the Aegean and from Scotland to the Caribbbean, reaching Barbados in January 1966. He cruised the east coast of the USA as far as Iversterly, Rhode Island. The planned return voyage to England in 1967 ended in disaster and the loss of &#39;Odd Times&#39; whilst under tow.
