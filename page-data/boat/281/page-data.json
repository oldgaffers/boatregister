She was originally built with a transom stern, of the normal pine on oak construction, with a small cuddy forward of the mast and fish hold, below the main deck aft of the mast.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In 1919 she was extended to 33&#39; by the addition of the counter stern, which was built by Cooke in his barge yard at the other end of Maldon Town Quay from Howard&#39;s old yard (then being run by Dan Webb). Until 1955 she was fished out of Maldon by the Pitt family. Of all the Maldon and Brightlingsea smacks which lay on the bank of the Blackwater below the quay, &#39;Polly&#39; was the only one without an engine in the early 1950s. In those days, it was often said that the fact she had never been subjected to the strains and vibrations of an engine resulted in her fastenings being in much better condition than any of the other boats. As Wally and Ernie Pitt had only the sails to propel them up and down the Blackwater, her running rigging was easily the best in the fleet. Wally and Ernie were a familiar sight on the river, often beating up to their mooring early on the flood, tacking up the narrow channel without saying a word.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&#39;Polly&#39; missed the first East Coast Old Gaffers race, 1963, but Ian Edmond brought her along in 1964. He sailed a very rine race in a light breeze to be the first winner of the Tom Bolton Memorial Cup for the first fishing or ex-fisnihng boat over the finishing line. In this, Ian was helped by the relatively large sail area and very fine, unusually long run aft.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>First published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter, 1973/3</h4>", "generic_type": "Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.7432333577176298, "draft": 1.127773713728359, "length_on_waterline": 8.900268227261643, "length_over_all": 10.36332601804438}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Mistley", "hull_form": "unknown", "id": "4c66a617-4b82-4cdb-9e16-44444e7915fc", "image_key": "vnnQDt", "length_on_deck": 10.3632, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Polly", "oga_no": 281, "ownerships": [{"note": "In 1955 Wally and Ernie Pitt decided they were getting too old to carry on fishing and sold 'Polly' to John Kemp of Heybridge, who, in turn, sold her to Ian Edmond in 1960.
