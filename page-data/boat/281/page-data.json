She\nwas originally built with a transom stern, of the normal pine on oak\nconstruction, with a small cuddy forward of the mast and fish hold, below the\nmain deck aft of the mast.</p>\n<p>In 1919 she was extended to 33 foot by the addition of the counter stern, which\nwas built by Cooke in his barge yard at the other end of Maldon Town Quay from\nHoward's old yard (then being run by Dan Webb). Until 1955 she was fishing out\nof Maldon with the Pitt family. Of all the Maldon and Brightlingsea smacks which\nlay on the bank of the Blackwater below the quay, <em>Polly</em> was the only one\nwithout an engine in the early 1950s. In those days, it was often said that the\nfact she had never been subjected to the strains and vibrations of an engine\nresulted in her fastenings being in much better condition than any of the other\nboats. As Wally and Ernie Pitt had only the sails to propel them up and down the\nBlackwater, her running rigging was easily the best in the fleet. Wally and\nErnie were a familiar sight on the river, often beating up to their mooring\nearly on the flood, tacking up the narrow channel without saying a word.</p>\n<p><em>Polly</em> missed the first East Coast Old Gaffers race, 1963, but Ian Edmond\nbrought her along in 1964. He sailed a very nice race in a light breeze to be\nthe first winner of the Tom Bolton Memorial Cup for the first fishing or\nex-fishing boat over the finishing line. In this, Ian was helped by the\nrelatively large sail area and very fine, unusually long run aft.
