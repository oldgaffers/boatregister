Most boats surviving\nfrom those days are old fishing boats, but <em>Bonita</em> was built as a yacht,\nCrossfields giving her a clipper bow. She was originally a cutter and likely to\nhave been open after of the mast, the shell-back cabin probably being a\ntwentieth addition. She was altered from cutter to yawl in 1907. She is a very\nelegant old lady, but there are few luxuries when living aboard. She has been in\nthe family since 1937, when she was bought for \u00a390. She is largely original, and\nunlike many old boats, she has never been rebuilt.</p>\n<p>In 2013, <em>Bonita</em> was the oldest boat to take part in the OGA Round Britain\nChallenge, celebrating the OGA's 50th and her own 125th birthday.
