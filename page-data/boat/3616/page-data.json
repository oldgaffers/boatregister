This led to the designing and building of\nso-called canoe yawls, although strictly speaking they were neither. Not only\ndid they race against each other, both paddling and sailing, but they were also\ncruised extensively on sheltered inland waters. In the days before cars were\nused to trailer boats, the canoe yawls were built very lightly so that they\ncould be loaded and carried on trains, and occasionally they were also\ntransported by steamer to the European mainland. One of the Humber Yawl Club\u2019s\nfounding members was a young engineer called George Holmes who, in 1888,\ndesigned a canoe yawl called ETHEL which was built locally by J. Akester. At\n13\u20322\u2033 ETHEL was specifically designed to fit in a guard\u2019s van (caboose) on a\ntrain, and her beam allowed two people to sleep on board, on either side of the\ncenterboard case.</p>\n<p>In 1991, <em>Classic Boat</em> magazine ran a series of articles on the build of a\nstrip-planked replica of ETHEL. On seeing this, Tom Dunderdale commissioned Paul\nFisher of Selway Fisher Design to design a slightly larger version. The result\nwas the Lillie design which, with a length of 14\u203211\u2033, could be built of\nstitch-and-glue plywood using 8\u2032 sheets of plywood scarfed together, with seven\nstrakes. Although Tom\u2019s boat was built this way, Paul also produced plans to\nallow strip-planked construction.\"</p>", "generic_type": "Dayboat", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.524, "draft": 0.152, "length_on_deck": 4.572}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "centre-board dinghy", "image_key": "6dT59p", "mainsail_type": "lug", "name": "Dotty", "newItems": {"builder": {"id": "cbc16128-0bbe-432e-8a18-5ff58b60fff8", "name": "Tom Dunderdale"}, "design_class": {"id": "0725f749-3cb3-449c-90f1-889815462a24", "name": "Lillie Canoe Yawl"}}, "oga_no": 3616, "rig_type": "Yawl", "short_description": "<p>Canoe Yawl derived from George Holmes' Ethel</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "year": 1995, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3616"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
