She was built by Eversons of Woodbridge out of Oregon pine on oak frames, with a double copped skin on all her immersed hull. Unfortunately her original hull drawings were lost in the floods of 1953, but her original design spec and sail plan survive. </p>\n<p>She underwent a complete restoration in 1979 by the New Zealand carpenter Grant Adams, and was later popularised by the journalist and novelist Sylvia Murphy, who with her illustrator husband cruised 'Nyala' widely, and wrote a book dedicated to her restoration \"Keeping Nyala in Style\".
