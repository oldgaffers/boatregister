She was built by Eversons of Woodbridge out of Oregon pine on oak frames, with a double copped skin on all her immersed hull. Unfortunately her original hull drawings were lost in the floods of 1953, but her original design spec and sail plan survive. \r\n\r\nShe underwent a complete restoration in 1979 by the New Zealand carpenter Grant Adams, and was later popularised by the journalist and novelist Sylvia Murphy, who with her illustrator husband cruised 'Nyala' widely, and wrote a book dedicated to her restoration \"Keeping Nyala in Style\". A second restoration in 2011 kept her going strong.\r\n\r\nAfter 20 years in the Mediterranean 'Nyala' found a new owner and headed north in 2017.\r\n\r\nShe is now kept in Paimpol, Brittany, and had been classified as a Patrimonial INterest Boat (BIP) by the French official Association \"Patrimoine Maritime et Fluvial\".\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the information can be read in the Classic Boat articles","image_key":"bGVQLZ","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-jk8zwD6/0/Th/i-jk8zwD6-Th.jpg","uk_part1":"165445","spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Yawl","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine on American Elm","draft":1.3716,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":3.2004389173372347,"draft":1.3716166788588149,"length_over_all":10.515727871250913,"length_on_waterline":8.83930748597903},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.5156,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00","website":"","beam":3.2004,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"e5c00172-7ec2-4bc9-9979-d47454b84ba4","designer":"956ab338-19b7-4d90-9e8d-d3cecd98fe9e","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Maurice Griffiths"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Yawl"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Everson A. and Sons"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
