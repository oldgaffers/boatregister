Harrison Butler"}], "full_description": "<p>The Zyclon 4-tonner named <em>Zephon</em>, was found in Penryn, close to Falmouth\nfirmly supported by beaching legs. Her cockpit was not covered and not\nself-draining so there was some water in the bilge but other than that she\nlooked pretty healthy when we arrived at low tide</p>\n<p>During the night rain fell in abundance and <em>Zephon</em>\u2019s bilge was filled again\nwith rainwater. No salty taste, so the hull was watertight. A superficial\ninspection of the hull gave me confidence that she could be sailed home to\nHolland. I saw 9 broken frames, but she was built sturdily enough.</p>\n<p>The deck didn\u2019t leak. Too bad that it was covered with polyester which sounded,\nmoving around on it, like walking on a freshly laid shell path.</p>\n<p>The hatches were in a bad condition and leaked and the cockpit was a shambles of\nloose planks.</p>\n<p>Somebody at one time started rebuilding the interior of reclaimed timber.</p>\n<p>The previous owner had removed the engine and dismounted the shaft tube and\nplugged the hole.</p>\n<p>Even so, <em>Zephon</em> looked healthy and, after all, I was looking for a restoration\nthat I could be proud of.</p>\n<p>Once home again, negotiations started resulting in a good deal. Everybody happy!</p>\n<p>My plan was to spend a week preparing the boat to make her ready to sail to\nHolland without an engine. My friends convinced me that this was not a very good\nidea so I considered to use an outboard engine instead. This had been tried by\nthe previous owner; it didn\u2019t work well, the propeller came out of the water\ntrying to make itself useful as a windmill or the whole engine taking a dive\ndisappearing from sight. So, in the end I started looking out for a used 10 hp\nYanmar inboard engine.</p>\n<p>On our way</p>\n<p>My car was fully loaded with a used Yanmar, spare parts, tools and friends Han\nand Roos and we set out to drive to Penryn.</p>\n<p>Han and I would prepare the boat for the trip to Holland and Rose would drive\nthe car back to Holland. Han postponed his decision to sail along as a crew\nmember or not depending on his final analysis of risks involved.</p>\n<p>Instead of lifting Zephon out of the water (too expensive: \u00a3400) , we decided to\ntransport the engine by dinghy and hoist it on board using the boom and main\nsail sheet. Piece of cake. We struggled through thick mud at low tide,\ndismounted the disk covering the propeller tube hole, unplugged the hole from\nthe inside and shoved in the propeller tube accompanied with lots of kit and\nthen the propeller shaft with propeller. We finished the job off by squeezing in\nlots of lubrication grease and waited for high tide to see wether or not we had\nto call the fire brigade.</p>\n<p>Everything stayed watertight. Time for a beer on the harbor quay.</p>\n<p>The previous owner, Giles Gilmore, was out of the country but helped us\ntremendously by asking his girlfriend to put her apartment at our disposal.\nFantastic to be able to take a hot shower after all the mud, the blood and no\nbeer , than finally we had some British ale ,and slept in a real bed.</p>\n<p>Back on board of Zephon we had to install Yanmar somewhat more aft than where\nthe dismantled engine had been, which meant that part of the bridge deck had to\nbe demolished.</p>\n<p>Most work involved driving back and forth to local stores to score English\nfittings to match European hose sizes or discovering that the engine flange was\n1 inch, not 25 mm.</p>\n<p>The 3rd day the engine was running and Zephon could be further prepared for the\nhigh seas.</p>\n<p>Our first few meters with Zephon were hilarious.</p>\n<p>We sailed to a harbour in Falmouth, Han at the helm, Rose busying herself with\nmooring lines and fenders.</p>\n<p>I had positioned myself in the \u201cengine room\u201d shifting gears from forwards to\nreverse and vice versa because of the lack of a morse handel handle.</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t very good at this could and could not hear Han shouting. ,we found out\nthat it wasn\u2019t easy to properly steer Zephon, she ,being a boat where the\npropeller shaft is positioned off-center and does not give any pressure on the\nrudder blade.</p>\n<p>Rose left to visit her relatives and Han stayed to share in our adventurous\nundertaking.</p>\n<p>The weather did not cooperate ,and with a stiff north easterly wind we, hard\ncore pensioners sailing an unfamiliar 6 m short boat, experienced tough\ncircumstances in a wild, rough sea.</p>\n<p>We left Falmouth together with a Dutch, pitch black J-class yacht. She did her\nbest to look like a submarine, waves running over deck. Very soon they let the\nsails down, started the engine and returned to Falmouth. That provided us the\nexcuse, without loosing face, to return to St. Just creek, a magnificent spot\nwhere, unfortunately, I lost my wallet while hoisting a mooring buoy on board.</p>\n<p>For those having aspirations to dive for a fortune, I lost it close to buoy C16.\nIt lies approximately 10 feet deep and contains enough quid to get drunk in the\npub.</p>\n<p>We scraped our dutch courage together and left next day again.</p>\n<p>At Dodman Point\u2019s our foresail was torn apart. We considered to turn around\nprofiting from the backstay wind or round this cape using mainsail and jib only.\nThis worked and without any further damage we arrived in Fowey harbor. Too bad\nwe were at leeward shore with lots of wind; we could have made it to Mevagissey\nor Charlestown if conditions had been better.</p>\n<p>Part of the purchase deal was a typical, sturdy British dinghy; Han thought we\nshouldn\u2019t leave her behind so we towed her behind Zephon. This worked out quite\nwell except when the sea was rough and she overtook us by planing on the waves\nto be stopped abruptly by the towing line. She even tried to jump on board\nseveral times which started to irritate us, but after having taken care of her\nso many miles we became a little attached to our baby. The best remedy to keep\nher in check was to incorporate 2 rubber shock absorbers in the towing line\nclose to the dinghy.</p>\n<p>In Studland Bay we decided to try out our beaching legs. We cleaned up her\nbottom and had a good look at her from a distance. She is a peculiar boat, you\nlike her or you don\u2019t, but she is certainly a remarkable appearance.</p>\n<p>We climbed up the hill to find a nice pub to enjoy a good healthy bar meal. To\nour amazement 2 other old men arrived to have a beer or two and their meal but\nstill wearing their life vests 200 meters above sea level.</p>\n<p>In Shoreham we beached the boat again, this time not using the legs; not on\npurpose, we left our bunks just a little too late. We spent 4 hours anxiously\nwaiting for the boat, with her eyes below water, to reluctantly stand upright\nagain.</p>\n<p>From here on the lack of wind coming from the northeast made us use the engine a\nlot and we made good progress. Such good progress that we decided to spend a day\nin Oostende.</p>\n<p>We stayed for 2 days, as the wind had shifted to SW and had increased to Bft\n6-7, not particularly ideal conditions for a little, 6 meter long boat. But to\nbe honest, the Belgian beer was not bad either.</p>\n<p>We were lucky to find MFV \u201cBorder Maid\u201d willing to take our dinghy along to\nHaarlem.</p>\n<p>We were freed from our child and happily concluded the final miles to Holland\nwith a genuine Belgian hangover.</p>\n<p>All in all we had a nice sailing trip of about 1500 nm of which some 1000 up and\ndown and the remainder horizontally.</p>\n<p>Zephon sails very nicely in smooth water and steers itself, sometimes running\nmore than 5 kts.</p>\n<p>We experienced rough seas frequently, slowing us down considerably.</p>\n<p>The engine made us reach a speed of 2,5-3 kts. Not very fast. We went backwards\nwith the engine in forward gear when rounding Portland Bill; the current was too\nmuch for our little engine.</p>\n<p>My theory to explain the engine\u2019s misbehavior is that the propeller\u2019s pitch does\nnot match the reduction of the gear box.</p>\n<p>Zephon frequently aroused enthusiastic and compassionate reactions. She was\nphotographed for instance, resting on her beaching legs, by Mike, an Englishman,\nwho found us in the local pub to exchange addresses so he could send us the\npictures.</p>\n<p>In Scheveningen somebody knocked on the hatch. He brought us a couple of\nPrestige beers. Sailors who visit Scheveningen harbor with such a beauty deserve\nto be treated on a beer. How about that?</p>\n<p>Zephon arrived safely in Enkhuizen in 2019, ready to undergo a proper refit over\nthe winter. She was sailing again, fully repaired in 2021.</p>\n<p>Where does this peculiar name come from?</p>\n<p>Harrison Butler asked his customers that bought a design from him to choose a\nname for the boat starting out with the letter of the particular type. In\nZephon\u2019s case the Z of Zyclon.</p>\n<p>After bringing her to Enkhuizen I googled the meaning of Zephon. He (not she)\nwas an angel guarding paradise described in the Hebrew bible.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, I am sure that our trip with a boat named after the \u201cGuardian of\nParadise\u201d could not have gone wrong at all</p>\n<p>Fred Schotman</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.185, "draft": 1.219, "length_on_deck": 6.706}, "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "image_key": "WhWPhf", "mainsail_type": "bermudan", "name": "Zephon", "oga_no": 3664, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "name": "Fred Schotman", "share": 64, "start": 2019}], "place_built": "Brentford", "rig_type": "Sloop", "short_description": "<p><em>Zephon</em> is now based in the Netherlands</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "year": 1950}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3664"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
