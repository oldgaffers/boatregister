A lot of work was done by George Kingston there and the hull seems fine apart form a damaged board at the heads outlet.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>She has been dug into a field to make her easier to work on as she is 2.4m from keel to rail. The superstructure all needs doing hence the location and the dig. She sits in a shale bed surrounded by 15mm gravel so it free drains. Hopefully that will keep her from rotting.
