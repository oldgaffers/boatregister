One of probably two ever built in the UK, first being \"Buffo\" as featured in The Bullimore Fleet Classic Boat No 106 March 1997. She was built slightly larger than Phil Bolger's original design with a different interior to accommodate the Yanmar Diesel engine and a curved bowsprit was added in the late 90s which retains the tradition of East coast catboat design. Her relatively deep keel incorporating 200kg of lead make a stiff able pocket cruiser.</p>","image_key":"DZvQ56","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"other","rig_type":"cat_boat","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"cold_moulded","construction_details":null,"draft":0.914,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.134},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":4.45,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Phil Bolger designed Lynx&nbsp;</p>","updated_at":"2022-05-03T18:08:21.656984+00:00","website":null,"beam":null,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"ownerships":null,"builder":null,"designer":"28e7f71c-8151-4614-8528-a1b83d6fa583","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"cold_moulded"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Philip Bolger"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"cat_boat"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":null,"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
