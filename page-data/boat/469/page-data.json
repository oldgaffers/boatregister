Following another major refit\nand new owner, Michael Field, she has returned to the Southampton area, UK,\n2017.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Carlotta</em></strong> <strong>\u2013 Her story - June 2010 OGA Logbook</strong></p>\n<p>This year the venerable Bristol Channel pilot cutter <em>Carlotta</em> turns one\nhundred and eleven years old!  </p>\n<p>She\u2019s been owned and sailed by pilots, princesses, lords, criminals, Churchill\u2019s\ncousin, viscounts, an illegitimate line of the Royal family, and adventurous\nCanadians. Her history includes a daring World War II escape from Guernsey as\nthe Germans were landing at the airport. She\u2019s been laid over by hurricane force\nwinds until the mast trucks were almost hitting the water. She\u2019s raced\nsuccessfully against Twelve-metres.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The British Army Training Manual was written on board. One time a porpoise swam\nacross her foredeck in a Scottish gale! She\u2019s been dropped four feet from a\ntravel lift, towed by rowboat completely around Texada Island, made passages\naveraging 180-mile days, and been engineless for the past forty years.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the 70\u2019s she fell over on her beaching legs, smashing her port side frames\nin. That was almost the end of her, but in stepped Canadian Peter Heiberg. Peter\nbought <em>Carlotta</em> and began a four year rebuild at Thomas Ponsharden\u2019s yard in\nFalmouth. Peter got her sailing again and set off for Vancouver BC, stopping in\nthe Caribbean for a few years along the way to race in the classic boat circuit\nout of St.Barts.</p>\n<p>Eventually Peter brought <em>Carlotta</em> back to Vancouver, where he was the founding\nmember of the Old Gaffer\u2019s Association of BC. The BC chapter of the OGA\nfrequently got together to race against each other, but somehow the organization\ndissolved. Now the chapter is back under full sail with a new revived interest\nspurred on by Mr. Colin Ming!</p>\n<p>In 2004 Heiberg sold <em>Carlotta</em> to Barbra and Stephen Mohan. Long time admirers\nof <em>Carlotta</em> and pilot cutters, the Mohans jumped at the chance to be\n<em>Carlotta\u2019s</em> next custodians. After one year of sailing and living aboard on the\nSunshine Coast of British Columbia attention was turned to long term maintenance\nand repair. The Mohan\u2019s began the process of restoring <em>Carlotta</em> with an eye\ntowards the original workboat she was in 1899. Now <em>Carlotta</em> is once again\nsailing after an extensive five year refit and is ready for many more years of\nfantastic adventures.</p>\n<p>Stephen Mohan, British Columbia and Pacific North West OGA</p>\n<p>In 2015 <em>Carlotta</em> was based at Powell River, British Columbia, and purchased by\nMichael Wright who lives in London. She underwent repairs and restoration work\nat the yard of Abernethy and Gaudin on Vancouver Island. In 2017, she was\ntransported by road and by sea back to the UK after more than 43 years abroad to\nher new base on the River Hamble, near Southampton.</p>", "generic_type": ["Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.962, "draft": 2.347, "length_on_deck": 15.24, "length_on_waterline": 12.802, "length_over_all": 15.24}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Southampton", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "3332ce93-73e6-43de-80a1-2d7367228784", "image_key": "3JqDjV", "lastModified": "2024-09-10T23:05:52Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Carlotta", "oga_no": 469, "ownerships": [{"name": "An Owner", "share": 64}, {"name": "An Owner", "share": 64}, {"end": 1907, "name": "Cumberland Sea Fisheries Committee", "share": 64, "start": 1900}, {"end": 2004, "name": "Peter Heiberg", "share": 64, "start": 1980}, {"end": 2015, "name": "Stephen Mohan", "share": 64, "start": 2004}, {"name": "Michael Wright", "share": 64, "start": 2015}], "place_built": "Gloucester", "previous_names": ["The Solway"], "reference": ["The Lancashire Nobby, by Nick Miller, Pub Amberley, ISBN 978 1 84868 490 4"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>The Cumberland Sea Fisheries Patrol cutter <em>Solway</em>, now <em>Carlotta</em>, built in\n1899 has a fascinating history.</p>", "uk_part1": "102469", "updated_at": "2026-02-02", "website": "https://carlottapilotcutter.com/", "year": 1899, "year_is_approximate": false, "year_of_build": {"value": 1899}}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/469"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
