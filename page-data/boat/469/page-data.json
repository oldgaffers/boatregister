She\u2019s been owned and sailed by the Cumberland Sea Fisheries committee,\na ships' chandler princesses, lords, criminals, Churchill\u2019s cousin, viscounts,\nan illegitimate line of the Royal family, and one-eyed Canadians.</p>\n<p>The Cumberland Committee\u00a0held their AGM on 20<sup>th</sup> April 1899, they resolved to\norder the patrol boat\u00a0for the south of their district from W H Holford of\nGloucester for \u00a3475 (\u00a338,230).\u00a0 She measured 49 foot 10 inch on deck,\nthirteen-foot beam and drew seven foot eight inches of water, and was named <em>The\nSolway</em>.\u00a0 She was employed on patrol duties until 1907, with a crew of four.\u00a0\nHer master was Luke Woodhouse of High Street, Maryport.\u00a0 The 1901 census\ndescribed Luke Woodhouse as a thirty six year old \u2018Sea Fisheries Boatman\u2019.\u00a0 From\n1903 her Master was John Edmondson Routledge, of 105 High Street, Maryport.\u00a0 On\nthe 20th of June 1907, the boat was transferred to ship chandler John Thomas Kee\nof 25 West Quay, Ramsey, Isle of Man.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her history includes a daring World War II escape from Guernsey as the Germans\nwere landing at the airport. She\u2019s been laid over by hurricane force winds until\nthe mast trucks were almost hitting the water. She\u2019s raced successfully against\n12-metres. The British Army Training Manual was written on board. One time a\nporpoise swam across her foredeck in a Scottish gale! She\u2019s been dropped four\nfeet from a travel lift, towed by rowboat completely around Texada Island, made\npassages averaging 180-mile days, and been engineless for the past 40 years.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s she fell over on her beaching legs, smashing her port side frames\nin. That was almost the end of her, but in stepped Canadian Peter Heiberg. Peter\nbought Carlotta and began a four year rebuild at Thomas Ponsharden\u2019s yard in\nFalmouth. Peter got her sailing again and set off for Vancouver BC, stopping in\nthe Caribbean for a few years along the way to race in the classic boat circuit\nout of St.Barts.</p>\n<p>Eventually Peter brought Carlotta back to Vancouver, where he was the founding\nmember of the Old Gaffer\u2019s Association of BC. The BC chapter of the OGA\nfrequently got together to race against each other, but somehow the organization\ndissolved. Now it is back under full sail with a new revived interest spurred on\nby Mr. Colin Ming.</p>\n<p>In 2004 Heiberg sold Carlotta to Barbara and Stephen Mohan. Long time admirers\nof Carlotta and pilot cutters, the Mohans jumped at the chance to be Carlotta\u2019s\nnext custodians. After one year of sailing and living aboard on the Sunshine\nCoast of British Columbia attention was turned to long term maintenance and\nrepair. The Mohan\u2019s began the process of restoring Carlotta with an eye towards\nthe original workboat she was in 1899.\u00a0 It should be noted that Carlotta did not\nwork as a pilot cutter in her career.\u00a0 She was adopted by the Bristol Channel\nPilot Cutters Owners Association as she is the only extant example of a cutter\nbuilt by W H Holford who had built a couple of Pilot cutters.</p>\n<p>In 2015\u00a0Carlotta was based at Powell River, British Columbia, and purchased by\nMichael Wright who lives in London. She underwent repairs and restoration work\nat the yard of Abernethy and Gaudin on Vancouver Island. In 2017, she was\ntransported by road and by sea back to the UK after more than 43 years abroad to\nher new base on the River Hamble, near Southampton.</p>\n<h3>Archive silent film footage of Carlotta in 1937</h3>", "generic_type": "Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.962, "draft": 2.347, "length_on_deck": 15.24, "length_on_waterline": 12.802, "length_over_all": 15.24}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Southampton", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "3332ce93-73e6-43de-80a1-2d7367228784", "image_key": "3JqDjV", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Carlotta", "oga_no": 469, "ownerships": [{"name": "An Owner", "share": 64}, {"name": "An Owner", "share": 64}, {"end": 1907, "name": "Cumberland Sea Fisheries Committee", "share": 64, "start": 1900}, {"end": 2004, "name": "Peter Heiberg", "share": 64, "start": 1980}, {"end": 2015, "name": "Stephen Mohan", "share": 64, "start": 2004}, {"name": "Michael Wright", "share": 64, "start": 2015}], "place_built": "Gloucester", "previous_names": ["The Solway"], "reference": ["The Lancashire Nobby, by Nick Miller, Pub Amberley, ISBN 978 1 84868 490 4"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>The Cumberland Sea Fisheries Patrol cutter Solway, now 'Carlotta', built in 1899\nhas a fascinating history and has been sailing on the Pacific northwest of North\nAmerica following an extensive refit, 2004.
