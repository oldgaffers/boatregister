She often winters at\nthe St Katharine Docks next to the Tower of London, but can mostly\u00a0be seen\nracing on the East Coast, South Coast and, for the odd regatta, in mainland\nEurope.</p>\n<p>'My Alice' is one of the UK's\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/register/1965/my-alice\">National Historic\nFleet</a>. She is\njust on 70' feet overall. Downwind she is just on 70' wide!\u00a0Masthead is about\n75' up. She's a little over 11.5 feet in beam, weighing in at 20 tons plus rig.\nShe is number 132 of Classic Boat magazine's\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.classicboat.co.uk/articles/boat-tests/top-250-classic-boats/3/\">world's top 250\nboats</a>.</p>\n<p>Charles Kidby had a good reputation for building very sound smacks and yachts.\nThe lines of 'My Alice' reflect the design of someone who built both yachts and\nsmacks. She has a very elegant counter and plenty of 'bite' to windward in her\nunderwater sections. Her racing skipper owner was probably an influence too. 'My\nAlice' was built for, and owned by Captain Fred Stokes of Tollesbury on the\nRiver Blackwater. At the turn of the century the big expensive \"gentlemens'\nyachts\" that raced on the English South Coast were largely crewed by\nprofessional sailors from Brightlingsea, Wivenhoe, Rowhedge and Tollesbury on\nthe English East Coast (a bit like all the grand prix yachts full of Kiwis\ntoday).</p>\n<p>Fred spent his summers racing as a rather successful skipper. As you are only\nsupposed to catch oysters when there is an R in the month in the northern\nhemisphere, racing in May, June, July and August fitted rather well. In 1905 Mrs\nTurner Farley had commissioned a racing yacht, 'Sonja', in the 52' rating class\nand she had gone to Nathanael Herreschoff with the commission.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, with Fred skippering and Nat's design, 'Sonja' had a string of\nsuccessful regattas around the UK, between 1905 and 1908 (<a href=\"http://www.heppell.net/sail/media/sonja.pdf\">read this report of\none</a>). She won hundreds of pounds\nof prize money and Fred's share would have been maybe as much as \u00a3100 per\nseason. This prize money, and the pro-skipper wage of around \u00a33 per week gave\nCaptain Fred Stokes enough money to have his own boat, 'My Alice', commissioned\nat the Kidby yard. She was apparently his pride and joy.</p>\n<p>Although smacks by 1907 were contemplating and fitting engines, 'My Alice' owes\nmore to the racing yacht shapes of the previous decade. Fred knew what he\nwanted, a race boat and a smack!\u00a0Writing in Classic Boat back in June 1997 John\nLeather commented:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>But 'My Alice' had all the sailing characteristics of 20 years before, with a\nhull well formed for windward work, and a well rounded forefoot, which helped\navoid damage to stowboat gear when spratting. Her counter is narrow compared to\nmany smacks of that size which were slightly broader aft to assist when boarding\na trawl or stowboat net.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So she was the best of two worlds, fishing and racing and looking at the lines\nof Nat's race boats, you can see where the influence in the Kidby's yard came\nfrom. The Kidby yard closed in 1939.</p>\n<p>John Leather remembers 'My Alice' motoring into Brightlingsea in 1946 under her\nbig Lister diesel engine, shrimping and spratting in summer and winter,\nbut\u00a0still spared the indignity of a wheelhouse or a wheel. Money was tight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In 1987 'My Alice' was damaged\u00a0by a commercial ship in the Roach and briefly\nsunk. She was brought ashore, and then to John Milgate's yard at Pelham where\nshe sat (no doubt dreaming of her earlier days of work and regattas and fun).</p>\n<p>And she might have finished her days there, but for the arrival of Jim Dines in\n1993. Jim took her back to his yard in Maldon with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tsrigging.co.uk/\">its traditional and classic\nrigging service</a>. Jim assembled a team around Brian\nKennell, Sean White and others and set to work on an extensive, expensive\u00a0and\ndeserved rebuild of 'My Alice'. She needed to be completely replanked, one plank\nat a time, copying or saving what was there; her keels, sternpost, deadwoods,\nkeelson and stem were all rebuilt in massive West African opepe. Her sawn oak\nframes were all restored or replaced, also in sawn oak. A new deck was fitted\nusing two layers of 3/4\" ply, glass covered. A compromise but it held her all\ntogether.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The original deck layout was restored, with small hatches and large open deck\nspace. 'My Alice' has had the original scuttle hatch refitted, between the main\nhold hatch and the aft accommodation hatch. This was used to shoot the catch\ninto when at sea so as not to expose the boat to the danger of having the main\nhatch opened and capable of being breached by rough weather.</p>\n<p>Jim managed to track down the original sail drawings for her topsail (from\nGowens on Mersea) and using photographs was able to be fairly accurate about the\nproportions of her rig. Her main mast was replaced (it had rotted at the foot)\nand her topmast was replaced too (it was broken in the Colne Match).\u00a0Their size\nneeded revisiting with a little extra now added on her mast and gaff getting the\nscale right too. She certainly balances very well, fingertip steering, with her\n22' of Douglas fir bowsprit out in front.</p>\n<p>The rebuilding of 'My Alice' took Jim's team\u00a0fully nine years of hard work. When\nClassic Boat magazine revisited her for the Maldon Regatta of 2002 Jim would\nonly say it had all cost more than \u00a3120,000 because that was when he stopped\ncounting . . . at about half way.</p>\n<p>Today of course 'My Alice' is back home in Brightlingsea. One of the current\ncrew [2019] is the great great great grandson of Charles Kidby and her interior\nhas been refitted by folk including the great great grandson! Her racing crew is\naround 11 people, she is a big powerful smack.</p>", "generic_type": "Colchester Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.581, "draft": 1.829, "length_on_deck": 14.121, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Brightlingsea", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "04adf6b4-71a7-4b14-b829-5f58ec97af9c", "image_key": "nvTLSF", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "My Alice", "oga_no": 3241, "place_built": "Brightlingsea", "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "CK398", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'My Alice' was built in the Kidby yard at Brightlingsea, 1907.
