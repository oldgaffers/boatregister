Built on the erstwhile site of Ratsey and Lapthorns, Isle of Wight,\nthe famous yacht Dolly Varden has the same underwater lines as Star and Fanny.</p>\n<p>Fanny was built in 1872 for the Paskins family, Cowes fish merchants, and owners\nof Star, and sold to the owners of Star in 1920. Sha had various owners to 1938,\nand lay neglected on the beach to 1946, when she was overhauled, given a new\ntransom, new rigging and sails. At this time, a P model T Ford engine was\nfitted. Laid up in 1948 for ten months, she was then sold for \u00a370. A Coventry\nVictor engine was fitted in 1958.</p>\n<p>Fanny was bought by David Cook of Ipswich in 1959, and sold in 1972.</p>\n<p>Fanny has always had a successful racing record, and was particularly keenly\nraced by Mr. Cooke, making very regular appearances in the East Coast Old\nGaffers races. Her longevity is partly due to the fact that every piece of\ntimber on her was thoroughly soaked in linseed oil by the first owner.</p>\n<p>She took part in the OGA Jubilee Festival at Cowes in 2013.
