Unfortunately, it is now time to ask\nsomeone else to plan her summer cruising programme and look after her.\nProfessionally-built in 1980, Nightingale\u2019s mono-coque, ferro-cement hull and\ndecks have been uniquely sheathed and encapsulated in epoxy resin in order to\nprovide the driest and most comfortable traditionally rigged boat imaginable.\nThe four large berths, plus a pilot berth, enable four adults to make distance\npassages in comfort. Fitted with a 25 hp, 3 cylinder Vetus/Mitsubishi engine and\n250 litre fuel tank for long-distance cruising. All electronic equipment is in\nfull working order, including the fully-integrated trim-tab steering system with\nnumerous spares. Comprehensive sail wardrobe for both cruising and racing, plus\nmany extras including life raft, rigid and inflatable dinghy if required.  Lying\nCowes, Isle of Wight.
