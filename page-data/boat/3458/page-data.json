I originally tried to purchase Turtle in 1986 but my offer was rejected, in 2002 I came across her laying a wreck at Leigh on sea and bought her for \u00a330\\. Due to her construction with vertical iron nails there was no option but to sheath her in GRP which has proved a great success, 2007 new decks, 2018 new sails by James Lawrence, 2020 new bulkhead and \u201cyachty\u201d refit. Turtle was rumoured to have been built in North America as a farm or smallholding boat and was obviously designed to carry weight, eg sheep, pigs or hay etc . Cheaply built and not expected to last more than a few years. Locals say she was shipped to Tilbury dock on a Liberty ship just after WW2\\. She was owned in the 50s & 60s by the Leigh on Sea marine artist Vic Ellis and was moored by the Essex Yacht Club.
