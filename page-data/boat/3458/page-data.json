I originally tried to purchase Turtle in 1986 but my offer was rejected, in 2002 I came across her laying a wreck at Leigh on sea and bought her for £30\\. Due to her construction with vertical iron nails there was no option but to sheath her in GRP which has proved a great success, 2007 new decks, 2018 new sails by James Lawrence, 2020 new bulkhead and “yachty” refit. Turtle was rumoured to have been built in North America as a farm or smallholding boat and was obviously designed to carry weight, eg sheep, pigs or hay etc . Cheaply built and not expected to last more than a few years. Locals say she was shipped to Tilbury dock on a Liberty ship just after WW2\\. She was owned in the 50s & 60s by the Leigh on Sea marine artist Vic Ellis and was moored by the Essex Yacht Club. She has now been saved for many years of happy sailing.","image_key":"mrPghL","thumb":"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-J5fp89V/0/Th/i-J5fp89V-Th.jpg","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"strip_planking_epoxy_sheathed","construction_details":null,"draft":null,"generic_type":null,"handicap_data":null,"hull_form":"centre-boarder","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":null,"mainsail_type":"gunter","short_description":"Turtle is a heavy half deck day boat, built with a solid rock elm bottom board with strip planks iron nailed vertically, probably not expected to last more than a few years. she has now been sheathed with GRP. local rumour is that she was a farm boat shipped to Tilbury dock from North America just after WW2, she was owned by the marine artist Vic Ellis for many years","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00","website":null,"beam":null,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":null,"designer":null,"design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"strip_planking_epoxy_sheathed"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":null,"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Sloop"},"genericTypeByGenericType":null,"builderByBuilder":null,"for_sale_state":null,"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
