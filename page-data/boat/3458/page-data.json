I originally tried to purchase Turtle in 1986 but my offer was rejected,\nin 2002 I came across her laying a wreck at Leigh on sea and bought her for \u00a330.\nDue to her construction with vertical iron nails there was no option but to\nsheath her in GRP which has proved a great success, 2007 new decks, 2018 new\nsails by James Lawrence, 2020 new bulkhead and \u201cyachty\u201d refit. Turtle was\nrumoured to have been built in North America as a farm or smallholding boat and\nwas obviously designed to carry weight, eg sheep, pigs or hay etc . Cheaply\nbuilt and not expected to last more than a few years. Locals say she was shipped\nto Tilbury dock on a Liberty ship just after WW2. She was owned in the 50s &amp; 60s\nby the Leigh on Sea marine artist Vic Ellis and was moored by the Essex Yacht\nClub.
