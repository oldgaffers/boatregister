The hull form has been designed to give\nsuperior performance over more more dated designs. The rig, fully complementing\nthe hull, is incredibly efficient. Internally, comfort and versatility are\nassured offering space for onboard\u00a0 picnicking and overnight camping with\npurpose built storage areas.</p>\n<p>The cockpit has ample room for six adults and kit and is CE rated for category C\nwaters</p>\n<p>The rig is light and easily handled with a balanced lug mainsail and mizzen .\nThis proven rig keeps the center of effort low making a powerful stable boat.\nBeing un-stayed the carbon fibre rig is quick and easy to raise and\u00a0 lower and\nallows the boat to be de-powered off the wind.</p>\n<p>Conventional slab reefing is used for reducing sail. The whole rigs stows within\nthe length of the boat for easy, safe trailing and storage.</p>\n<p>She has a shallow long keel with centre plate that gives her great stability and\nenables her to sail in the shallows in as little as 16\u201d. Coupled with excellent\nwindward performance it makes her ideal for exploring estuaries and creeks. Her\nsealed centre plate is housed in the central locker maximizing space in the\ncockpit, increasing stiffness to the case and deck structure. The plate\nmechanism is easy to operate with its 10:1 gearing and is housed neatly out of\nharms way at the forward end of the locker.</p>\n<p>The forward spray rail has been designed to accommodate a spray hood that covers\nthe flat area above the storage lockers making a great lounging area or with the\noptional camping tent, extension slats and an air mattress produces a very\ncomfortable 6ft wide sleeping platform. She can also be sailed with the hood up\nunlike a lot of her competition.</p>\n<p>Her small aft locker is vented and is designed to take either a single burner\ncamping stove or a 12L remote fuel tank whose fuel line passes into the outboard\nwell, The outboard well is off-set to port and allows for a modern 4 stroke\noutboard engine of up to 6hp to be mounted and tilted clear of the water when\nsailing or left moored afloat</p>\n<p>Down either side of the cockpit she has two substantial iroko rails for securing\nsafety harnesses, fenders and warps. The helm seats are removable allowing for\nthe helm to get out of the wind and shelter low down on the sole boards. The\nsame seats also store the fire extinguisher and can accommodate canvas storage\nbins, for sail ties, warps etc. Alternatively, they can be ordered as additional\nsealed storage lockers .</p>\n<p>A CQR or Danforth anchor can be stored on chocks on the foredeck with its warp\nbeing stowed in its own well behind the main mast, the 2-part oars slide forward\nup tubes on the starboard side of the centre plate casing while the blades stow\nin the locker against the casing.</p>\n<p>Her substantial New England stlye \u2018Barn Door\u2019 type rudder gives a light balanced\nfeel with minimal weather helm, it is the same depth as the keel allowing it to\nbe left mounted while beaching, sailing in the shallows or leaving on a mooring.</p>\n<p>Launching and recovery could not be easier on her A frame multi roller swing\nbeam trailer.</p>", "generic_type": "Dayboat", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.899, "draft": 0.61, "length_on_deck": 5.486, "length_on_waterline": 5.486}, "home_country": "GBR", "hull_form": "centre-board dinghy", "image_key": "XLbZPX", "mainsail_type": "lug", "name": "Deben Lugger", "newItems": {"design_class": {"id": "9141bb2d-92f9-4786-abc9-52f9e4a2360b", "name": "Deben Lugger"}}, "oga_no": 3631, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 35228, "member": 6749, "share": 64, "start": "2022"}], "place_built": "Waldringfield", "rig_type": "Yawl", "short_description": "<p>A traditionally styled dayboat built in GRP</p>", "spar_material": "carbon_composite", "website": "https://thedebenlugger.co.uk", "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3631"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
