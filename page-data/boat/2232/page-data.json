He wrote 2 articles under the title of &quot;Home Waters&quot; in Yachting Monthly May 1912 and June 1911. The rig was converted to Bermudan in 1923 and the first engine fitted in 1933.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Hickman found her in Cowes blocked up out of the water in a very neglected state. he discovered she was up for sale and was such a mess as she had sunk at her mooring in the Medina for several months. He was very impressed with her but as he was restoring Abaca he didn&#39;t immediately put in an offer. During that summer she deterioated and there was a threat to break her up so he decided to put in a low offer which was accepted. He then had to get her back to his home at Bembridge. He stopped up seams that had opened, checked all the seacocks, refurbished the hand pump and put a portable petrol pump on board and she was towed there by the old, Attrill&#39;s built, Bembridge harbour ferry. The trip went well she hardly leakd at all. he has carried out a careful detailed restoration and he has detailed it all carefully. He has researched her history and has the original builder&#39;s plans of the hull lines and sail plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999 she underwent extensive restoration to her original specification. Her original builder&#39;s plans of hull and sail plan were found in early editions of Yachting Monthly. All her pitch pine and teak planking is original, as is much of the deck, cabin and cockpit joinery. Her rig is a new one but a faithful copy of the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tarifa has a shallow draft of 2ft 6ins with a lifting centre plate.</p>","image_key":null,"uk_part1":"165451","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Sloop","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine on Canadian rock elm with teak sheerstrake","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.43842965130456,"main":{"foot":6.5532796878810045,"head":4.26725188978298,"luff":7.924896366739819},"thcf":0.972783672,"draft":0.9144111192392099,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":8.574128261399657,"fore_triangle_base":3.3528407705437697,"length_on_waterline":6.160082906608144,"fore_triangle_height":6.705681541087539},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.5954,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"Tarifa was designed as a fast shoal draught cruising yacht for H Torif Garnham who sailed extensively on the East Coast with his wife.","updated_at":"2021-12-19T13:39:32.964379+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"cbdb2200-b74d-4fa1-ad09-8782b1c69ff9","designer":"6b0e581f-8507-4748-8d44-f8fb73dbef19","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"G.U.
