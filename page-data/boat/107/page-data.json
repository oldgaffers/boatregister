A 7hp\nKelvin engine was fitted, in the fo'csl, whilst fishing, but removed by Mike\nJohnson. Elizabeth Mary's rig was that of Polperro gaffer with a loose-footed\nboomless mainsail which was altered for dredging after the second world war.</p>\n<p>Her Plymouth fishing registration, PH107 came about because a previous owner,\nCol. Phibbs had registered her as a British vessel in that port and when a\nsubsequent owner tried to re-register her as a fishing vessel, the port could\nonly be changed at expense. Her original fishing number is believed to be FY28.\nThe following article was written by her owner in 1977.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2019Elizabeth Mary\u2019 was built at Looe by Pearce in 1908, allegedly as a Plymouth Hooker, but I haven't seen any other Hooker that looked at all like her and I suspect she was really built as a Polperro Gaffer, examples of which can be seen in Edgar March\u2019s 'Inshore Craft' book. She would have been used us a long liner, fishing between the Start and the Lizard mostly. Nothing is really known of her until she was bought by a Marines Capt. William O\u2019Hara Phibbs in 1931. He converted her to a yacht complete with cabin and eventually a small engine.</p>\n<p>She next changed hands in 1962 when she was bought by Mrs. Doreen Johnson of Penryn near Falmouth. She was transferred to her son Michael in 1970. He did a terrific amount of work on her which included taking the cabin off again and opening her up ready for use dredging oysters in the Fal estuary. She was re-decked, had new mast partners, beam shelves, frames where necessary, re-planked in part, new spars and rigging and a new rudder. With the help of a White Fish grant he also put in a Saab diesel engine. Mike Johnson worked her under sail for 2 or 3 seasons, and he took part in the local Gaffers races, unfortunately without too much success, apart that is from the Fowey passage races which he won on more than one occasion.</p>\n<p>Although dredging is only allowed under sail between 9am and 3pm, it is permitted to motor to the grounds before or after dredging. The thin end of the wedge for working sailing craft in Britain perhaps. Eventually however, Mike removed this engine which was how I bought her in partnership with Mike Birch, who has recently won the Jester Class trophy and first multihull trophy in the 1976 Single Handed Transatlantic Race. One day he will turn up at one of our Gaffers races with a gaff rigged Trimaran!</p>\n<p>She has only been used for pleasure, with the odd charter thrown in, since we've had her here in Dartmouth, and of course we've taken part in the local races when possible. Our first success was in a passage race during a regatta when with Mike\u2019s wife Jo helming, we sailed from Torquay to Dartmouth and finished second in front of 16 modern Bermudian craft. On corrected time we won by 15 minutes and so our rating was amended accordingly to leave us with a two minute victory. In 1976 we repeated the performance and won by eleven minutes after having led all the way to the last mark, some 200 yards from home, at which point a Bowman 46 managed to pass us - just.</p>\n<p>Mike Birch's delivery work and involvement in Round Britain and single handed racing didn't give him much time to use \u2018Elizabeth Mary\u2019 and so he sold me his shore early in 1976. We have taken part in the three South Western Old Gaffers Races with fair success, winning Class 2 in 1976, and taking the SW Commodore's Pennant as first SW boat. We made a hair raising passage up to Cowes in 1975, to finish second in the class, and to collect the Edgar J. March Memorial Trophy for the first work boat to finish. During the gale following that race, \u2018Elizabeth Mary\u2019 was damaged and her gaff broken.</p>\n<p>By the time repairs were effected and the weather looked anything like decent, it was November and we were not altogether happy about the prospect of a Channel passage under sail in an open boat in what was really winter. It turned out to be better than we had feared, and apart from a bumpy ride off Anvil, we made the passage to Dartmouth in about 16 hours, including a few zig-zags through the Russian fishing fleet resident in Lyme Bay at that time of year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Written by Trevor Vincett, OGA member in the South West who sold \u2018Elizabeth Mary\u2019 to JDA Burn of Totness in 1977.</h4>\n<p>First published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter, 1977/3.</p>", "generic_type": ["Polperro Gaffer"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.743, "draft": 1.32, "fore_triangle_base": 7.315, "fore_triangle_height": 8.839, "length_on_deck": 8.077, "length_on_waterline": 7.925, "length_over_all": 8.077, "main": {"foot": 6.096, "head": 6.096, "luff": 5.791}, "thcf": 1.007262825, "topsail": {"luff": 6.096, "perpendicular": 2.134}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Axmouth", "id": "aafc65c3-ba02-45af-90dd-123c9f45d12b", "image_key": "nGfCds", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Elizabeth Mary", "oga_no": 107, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "name": "George Dart", "share": 32, "start": 2012}, {"current": true, "name": "Ray Rush", "share": 32, "start": 2012}], "place_built": "Looe", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'Elizabeth Mary' was built at Looe, Cornwall by Pearce in 1908, allegadly as a\nPlymouth hooker.
