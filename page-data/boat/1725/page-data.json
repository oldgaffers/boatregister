Cannell"}], "full_description": "<p>The Tamarisk is 24ft long (plus a 6ft bowsprit), 8ft in beam, 3ft in draft and displaces about 3 tons. She is a long keel design so there\u2019s no centreboard taking up cabin space, and there\u2019s reasonable standing headroom in the main accommodation. \u00a0Above deck the spars are all well-varnished wood and there are four sails in good condition: jib (82 sq ft), staysail (71), main (182) and topsail (31). The topsail sets on the mast without the need for an additional yard and when set, although small, it usually adds half a knot to the boat\u2019s speed! \u00a0The foresails are on roller reefing stays and the main is very simple to set or reef. \u00a0All the standing and running rigging was been replaced when we bought the boat and is in excellent condition.From the generously sized aft cockpit, steps lead down to the main cabin which\nhas full length berths port and starboard with a folding leaf table between.\n\u00a0This can be used for chart work as well as meals. \u00a0Forward of the port berth is\nthe galley with a Taylor\u2019s two-burner paraffin cooker, a stainless steel sink\nand secure stowage for crockery etc.. \u00a0Opposite the galley, to starboard, is a\nseparate heads compartment equipped with a Jabsco sea toilet. There is ample\nstorage on shelves and in lockers under the berths and in the galley and heads.\n\u00a0A Taylor\u2019s paraffin cabin heater adds comfort on chillier evenings. \u00a0Forward of\nthe main cabin, in the fore cabin where there is sitting headroom, are two\nfurther full-length berths with storage lockers underneath. \u00a0From here there is\nan opening hatch to the deck and access to the chain locker. \u00a0Each berth is\nequipped with an LED reading light.</p>\n<p>The steps down into the main cabin can be lifted out to give access to the\nrecent Vetus M2-D5 13hp diesel engine that has run about 700 hours and is in\nexcellent condition. \u00a0At 2000rpm this gives a speed of 5 knots in smooth water.\n\u00a0As well as providing motive power the engine charges two lead-acid batteries,\none dedicated to engine starting and the other for lighting and instrumentation.\n\u00a0The engine control panel, which includes a rev counter and oil pressure gauge,\nis fitted in a recess in the cockpit.</p>\n<p>Navigation equipment includes steering and hand bearing compasses, NASA Clipper\nwind, speed and depth instruments, a Garmin 126 GPS and a Yeoman Sport chart\nplotter that uses A2 size Admiralty Leisure charts. \u00a0The GPS and plotter are\nlinked together to provide a really versatile facility whereby, for example,\nwaypoints marked on the chart can be instantly transferred to the GPS display in\nthe cockpit, and the current GPS position is constantly available on the chart.\n\u00a0The GPS is also permanently linked to the NASA SX35 DSC VHF set to provide\npositional information in the event of an emergency. \u00a0A NASA Navtex receiver is\nalso fitted.</p>\n<p>Deck gear includes all necessary warps and fenders, a 26lb CQR with and a\nDanforth kedge both with ground chains and nylon cables. \u00a0A 1.8m Plastimo rowing\ninflatable can be stowed deflated on deck or towed astern. \u00a0There is a horseshoe\nlifebuoy and two cockpit seat cushions that can also provide emergency\nflotation. \u00a0Fire extinguishers to BSS standards are fitted.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.438, "draft": 0.914, "fore_triangle_base": 4.039, "fore_triangle_height": 7.163, "length_on_deck": 7.263, "length_on_waterline": 6.452, "length_over_all": 7.265, "length_over_spars": 9.144, "main": {"foot": 3.81, "head": 2.743, "luff": 5.334}, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}, "thcf": 0.894214962, "topsail": {"luff": 3.149, "perpendicular": 1.88}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Itchenor", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "2368ca5d-bb19-4580-a0f4-f6da9e65f1a9", "image_key": "NTjRcP", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "mmsi": "235051528", "name": "Puffin Bach", "oga_no": 1725, "ownerships": [{"end": 2014, "name": "Dg And Aj Lovelock", "share": 64, "start": 2007}, {"current": true, "id": 34663, "member": 6247, "share": 32, "start": "2014"}, {"current": true, "id": 1009, "member": 6247, "share": 32, "start": "2014"}], "place_built": "Cornwall", "previous_names": ["Puffin Too", "Puffin Bac"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "PB", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>A fine example of a Tamarisk 24 class topsail gaff cutter.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "ssr": "61019", "year": 1986, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/1725"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
