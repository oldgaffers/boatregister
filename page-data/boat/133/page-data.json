Sometime\nbetween the two World Wars she became a yacht and was given a canoe stern, rigged\nas a yawl and her lands filled in so she was apparently carvel built. During that\ntime she sailed from Gravesend.</p>\n<p>In about 1956 she was acquired by Peter Brooks who rebuilt her on her original lines\nreplacing every timber except her keel. She was afterwards taken to Falmouth by\nPeter Brooks where she was purchased by John Cann. Rigged as a traditional\nBawley without a topmast.</p>\n<p>This lively article by John Cann was originally published in Gaffers Log, March 2007:</p>\n<p>\"<em>Vivid</em> has had a long and varied career that started\nwith her construction on the sea wall at Gravesend c1860. It is not known who\nbuilt her, but local bawley men tell me that she would have been launched by the\nsimple expedient of pushing her over the seawall into the river Thames on a high\nspring tide. <em>Vivid</em> is a bawley-rigged\ngaff cutter having a tall boomless mainsail which can be brailed up like a stage\ncurtain when moored up, or if I get in a panic! She is of clinker construction,\nwith the top two planks laid carvel fashion, to avoid snagging the gear. Employed\nmainly in the shrimping trade, <em>Vivid</em> worked to meet the ever growing\ndemands of the Victorian trippers who came downriver to Gravesend for\ntheir &lsquo;day out&rsquo; and a shrimp tea.</p>\n<p>In some small way our taking part in a recent &lsquo;Oyster Match&rsquo; attempts\nto continue that tradition, with me trying to supply sustenance for the hungry masses.\nAlas, if they depended on me, they would be sorely disappointed. So a few pointers on how,\nor perhaps &lsquo;how not&rsquo; to do it.</p>\n<p>Have in your ownership, or sign on with, a traditional working boat prepared for a\nday's &lsquo;hard labour&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Borrow a dredge and look bewildered. Someone will take pity on you and demonstrate\nhow to use it.</p>\n<p>Proceed to the oyster grounds with all sail set and line up outside the marker buoys.\nExamine what everyone else is doing and &lsquo;crib&rsquo; mercilessly.</p>\n<p>In the absence of any wind, drift about aimlessly and get unwisely tangled up\nwith other larger craft.</p>\n<p>Exchange details for later insurance claim.</p>\n<p>Charge around deck trying to catch the crabs that escaped the rubbish sort.</p>\n<p>Continue in this manner until end of run, then sail back up wind and start\nthe whole business again.</p>\n<p>This meaningless activity continues all day\nuntil time is signalled. This signal consists of the match master hoisting his\nold clothes out on a long oar dangled over the stern of his boat.</p>\n<p>Prepare a large bucket of seawater for the catch. Lob out dredge to windward,\nremembering to tie end to boat.</p>\n<p>Attempt to match speed of boat to speed of dredge over the grounds. How the devil do you do that?</p>\n<p>When boredom reaches unbearable threshold, haul harvest of the sea on deck.</p>\n<p>Sort oysters from assorted rubbish and tip back into sea (the whole contents of the dredge in our\ncase).</p>\n<p>Examine bucket. What only six oysters? All that effort for six\noysters? Discount the idea of becoming a full time dredgerman.</p>\n<p>Load crew and oyster bucket into inflatable dinghy and head for shore and official count.</p>\n<p>Notice port buoyancy tube is going soggy. Order crew to sit on other side\nand put finger over hole.</p>\n<p>Humiliating official count by representative of the oyster company who disputes my calculations.</p>\n<p>Head for restaurant and note that the winner caught 80 oysters. They must have cheated. Crestfallen,\nseek solace in suitable libations of alcohol.</p>\n<p>Return to <em>Vivid</em> in almost totally deflated dinghy, a bit like our pride really.\"</p>", "generic_type": "Bawley", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.7432, "draft": 0.9144, "length_on_deck": 7.4676, "length_on_waterline": 6.980004876859302, "length_over_all": 7.467690807120214}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Faversham", "id": "416ac633-ea6a-4c64-96be-1ca60bba69dc", "image_key": "gq4z6m", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Vivid", "oga_no": 133, "ownerships": [{"end": 1974, "id": 2, "member": 26, "share": 64, "start": 1964}, {"end": 2012, "name": "John Cann", "share": 64, "start": 2000}, {"current": true, "id": 792, "member": 5835, "share": 64, "start": 2012}], "place_built": "Gravesend", "previous_names": ["Vivida"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Date of build and name of original builder are unknown, but being a clinker built Gravesend bawley she is most likely to have been built in the 1880s.</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wMsmsGr/0/Th/i-wMsmsGr-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-07-14T15:00:35.220871+00:00", "year": 1882, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/133"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
