Key Points  Overall length of 13'6\" and beam of 5'3\" (4.1 x 1.6m) \u2013 a comfortable size for building at home in the garage. Easy to tow behind a small car and yet large enough for family sailing.  The single chine hull form follows on from the popular dinghies of the 50s and 60s \u2013 Hornet, Graduate, Scorpion, GP14, etc. \u2013 but with a more classic appearance and a sweeping sheer and raked transom.  Construction is a variation of stitch-and-tape, using CNC-cut components.  With simplicity of build in mind, and also functionality, she has a lowered deck in the same style as the Mirror Dinghy, which is useful for lessening the risk of lines going overboard and providing more sprawling space for children.  The versatile design allows for sailing, rowing, sculling or outboard motor.</p>", "generic_type": "Dinghy", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.6, "length_on_deck": 4.1}, "home_country": "United Kingdom", "home_port": "Grimsby", "hull_form": "centre-board dinghy", "id": "f05ba35f-5236-4b91-82f3-5b7b90f5aa78", "image_key": "cQ86JG", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Clachnacudney", "oga_no": 3514, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 615, "member": 5241, "share": 64, "start": 2018}], "rig_type": "Sloop", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>OGA designed dinghy.
