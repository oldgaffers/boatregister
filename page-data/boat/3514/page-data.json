Key Points Overall length of 13'6\" and beam of 5'3\" (4.1 x\n1.6m) \u2013 a comfortable size for building at home in the garage. Easy to tow\nbehind a small car and yet large enough for family sailing. The single chine\nhull form follows on from the popular dinghies of the 50s and 60s \u2013 Hornet,\nGraduate, Scorpion, GP14, etc. \u2013 but with a more classic appearance and a\nsweeping sheer and raked transom. Construction is a variation of\nstitch-and-tape, using CNC-cut components. With simplicity of build in mind, and\nalso functionality, she has a lowered deck in the same style as the Mirror\nDinghy, which is useful for lessening the risk of lines going overboard and\nproviding more sprawling space for children. The versatile design allows for\nsailing, rowing, sculling or outboard motor.</p>", "generic_type": "Dinghy", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.6, "draft": 0.994, "length_on_deck": 4.1, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Grimsby", "hull_form": "centre-board dinghy", "id": "f05ba35f-5236-4b91-82f3-5b7b90f5aa78", "image_key": "cQ86JG", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Clachnacudney", "oga_no": 3514, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 615, "member": 5241, "share": 64, "start": 2018}], "rig_type": "Sloop", "selling_status": "for_sale", "short_description": "<p>OGA designed dinghy.
