She is in very good order having had a major refit in 2002 and well maintained by professionals on an annual basis ever since. The boat has been wintered ashore every year. The professionally finished interior certainly makes this boat top of the list if you are looking for a modern boat with traditional styling and rig.</p><p>Contact Dan Shaw for full specification: an exceptional boat with great interior and extensive list of extras.</p>", "seller_gold_id": null, "seller_member": null, "sold": null, "summary": null, "updated_at": "2020-05-03T10:13:12.771732+00:00"}], "full_description": "<p>Susan J&#39;s first owners took her through the French canals and cruised the Mediterranean.
