Kevin Dillon-White later moved the boat to Poole where she has remained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1998, she sank, was salvaged and taken to Mitchell&#39;s Boatyard where Pierre Caestracaen aquired her. He did some work and put her back afloat with an outboard and no inboard engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tim Frearson bought her in 2000 and sailed her for the season with a rig that barely worked. At this stage she was a gunter sloop with bright blue sails, a Seagull Century outboard hanging off the back, a leaky deck and lots of pink paint down below. Tim took her home and rebolted the stem and stern, tightened all necessary fastenings and recaulked the hull. He took the cabin top off, replaced the carlin and refitted her beams and planking, sheathing the foredeck, cabin roof and afterdeck with epoxy glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also replaced the covering boards, quadrants, forward toerails, forehatch, Samson post and bitts, rudder, mainhatch, companionway doors and handrails. She had a new cockpit and was re-engined with a 1968 Stuart Turner (same as her previous inboard engine) when he replaced the interior to a new design.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.4384, "fore_triangle_base": 1.7678614971958058, "fore_triangle_height": 4.907339673250427, "length_on_deck": 6.096, "length_on_waterline": 6.0960741282613995, "length_over_all": 6.2484759814679345, "main": {"foot": 4.26725188978298, "head": 4.26725188978298, "luff": 2.3774689100219457}, "thcf": 0.847337765}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Poole", "hull_form": "unknown", "id": "227eaa06-1836-46c4-b2f1-243b2a6bab0c", "image_key": "mtDfvS", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Katrina", "oga_no": 1397, "ownerships": [{"end": 1990, "name": "P Guilor", "share": 64, "start": 1988}, {"end": 1998, "name": "Kevin Dillon-White", "share": 64, "start": 1990}, {"end": 2016, "name": "Tim Frearson", "share": 64, "start": 2000}, {"name": "Haydn Lipsett", "share": 64, "start": 2016}], "place_built": "Great Wakering", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Thought to have been built in Essex, 1954, it is not known where or by whom.
