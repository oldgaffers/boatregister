Economy limited the size to less than 23&#39; overall, while a plea from the Shipmate was more or less an order for 6ft headroom.&quot;</p><p>The preceding extract from the February 1937 issue of Yachting Monthly was penned by Maurice Griffith.</p><p>Robinetta was designed from the outset for single handing, with all lines except the jib halyard let to the cockpit. She is strongly built with pine planking on an oak frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead ballast. Her main cabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems from the extension of the hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on to say &quot;Perhaps the most striking feature of this experimental design is the fullness of the hull, the pronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships aft, and the enormous quarters, which appear to be based on those of the French crabbers.&quot;</p><p>Robinetta is mostly original. Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine by the current Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural repairs were performed during the winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings and doubling several ribs.</p><p>She was re-caulked with new gaff and sails in 2012.<br />Previous sail dimensions: Mainsail Head: 9.17 ft Topsail Perpendicular: 6ft Topsail luff 13 ft</p><p>Deck beam replaced and other repairs winter 2017/18.</p><p>Read articles about Robinetta from the Royal Cruising Club Journal, 1938, on <a href=\"http://www.sailing-by.org.uk/content/standing-waves-and-submarines\">Sailing by</a> and explore her <a href=\"http://robinetta-log.blogspot.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> with a detailed history of ownership and other exploits.","image_key":"9NV8KW","uk_part1":"165315","spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine on oak and elm","draft":1.3716,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.4384,"main":{"foot":3.9990246281394777,"head":4.26725188978298,"luff":4.319068519873201},"thcf":0.85,"topsail":{},"sailarea":24.15621400291268,"propellor":{"type":"fixed"},"length_over_all":6.858083394294074,"fore_triangle_base":1.5240185320653499,"length_on_waterline":6.0960741282613995,"fore_triangle_height":4.57205559619605},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.858,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<i>Robinetta</i> is a 22' 6\" tabloid cruiser, designed by Denys Rayner and built for him by the Enterprise Small Craft Company, Rock Ferry, Birkenhead.","updated_at":"2021-04-10T21:19:23.01332+00:00","website":"https://robinetta-log.blogspot.com/p/robinetta.html","beam":null,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"a27bca50-d155-428a-be49-a542d64ba316","designer":"afc68d59-e7ba-466e-861f-741e2eeae526","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"D.A.
