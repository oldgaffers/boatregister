She is strongly built with pine planking on an oak frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead ballast. Her main cabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems from the extension of the hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on to say, \"Perhaps the most striking feature of this experimental design is the fullness of the hull, the pronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships aft, and the enormous quarters, which appear to be based on those of the French crabbers.\"</p>\n<p>Robinetta is mostly original, but her iron keel was replaced by lead in the 1950 or 60s when small changes were also made to her foredeck, both to the designs of Alan Buchanan.</p>\n<p>Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine by the current Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural repairs were performed during the winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings and doubling several ribs.</p>\n<p>She was re-caulked with new gaff and sails in 2012.<br>\n <br>\n Previous sail dimensions: Mainsail Head: 9.17 ft Topsail Perpendicular: 6ft Topsail luff 13 ft</p>\n<p>Deck beam replaced and other repairs winter 2017/18.</p>\n<p>Read articles about Robinetta from the Royal Cruising Club Journal, 1938, on <a href=\"http://www.sailing-by.org.uk/content/standing-waves-and-submarines\">Sailing by</a> and explore her <a href=\"http://robinetta-log.blogspot.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> with a detailed history of ownership and other exploits.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.441, "fore_triangle_base": 1.5240185320653499, "fore_triangle_height": 4.57205559619605, "length_on_deck": 6.858, "length_on_waterline": 6.096, "length_over_all": 6.858083394294074, "main": {"foot": 4, "head": 4.26725188978298, "luff": 4.319068519873201}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 24.156, "thcf": 0.85, "topsail": {}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Tollesbury", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "85315666-4359-47f7-8d8d-4dd2905b7aa2", "image_key": "9NV8KW", "length_on_deck": 6.858, "mainsail_type": "gaff", "mssi": "235109366", "name": "Robinetta", "nsbr": "1717", "oga_no": 315, "ownerships": [{"end": 1946, "name": "Denys Rayner", "share": 64, "start": 1937}, {"end": 1949, "name": "Audrey Parker", "share": 32, "start": 1946}, {"end": 1949, "name": "Henry Parker", "share": 32, "start": 1946}, {"end": 1985, "name": "Nigel Heriot", "share": 64, "start": 1949}, {"end": 1986, "name": "Frank Driscoll", "share": 64, "start": 1985}, {"end": 2007, "name": "Mike Garnham", "share": 64, "start": 1986}, {"current": true, "id": 559, "member": 5004, "share": 32, "start": 2007}, {"current": true, "id": 1219, "member": 5004, "share": 32, "start": 2007}], "place_built": "Rock Ferry, Birkenhead", "reference": ["YM 1937"], "rig_type": "Cutter", "sail_number": "315", "short_description": "<i>Robinetta</i> is a 22' 6\" tabloid cruiser, designed by Denys Rayner and built for him by the Enterprise Small Craft Company, Rock Ferry, Birkenhead.", "spar_material": "wood", "ssr": "131134", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-F8N5HJk/2/Th/i-F8N5HJk-Th.jpg", "uk_part1": "165315", "updated_at": "2022-09-04T12:52:20.666308+00:00", "website": "https://robinetta-log.blogspot.com/p/robinetta.html", "year": 1937, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/315"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
