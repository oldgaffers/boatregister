Economy limited the size to less than 23' overall,\nwhile a plea from the Shipmate was more or less an order for 6ft headroom.\"</p>\n<p>The preceding extract from the February 1937 issue of Yachting Monthly was penned by Maurice Griffith.</p>\n<p><em>Robinetta</em> was designed from the outset for single handing, with all lines except the\njib halyard let to the cockpit. She was strongly built with pine planking on an oak and elm\nframe with an iron keel and a good deal of lead ballast. Her main cabin is cavernous\nfor such a tiny boat. Part of this stems from the extension of the hull upwards\nto form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on to say, \"Perhaps the most striking feature\nof this experimental design is the fullness of the hull, the pronounced tumblehome\nof the topsides from amidships aft, and the enormous quarters, which appear to be\nbased on those of the French crabbers.\"</p>\n<p>Robinetta is mostly original, but her iron keel was replaced by lead in the 1950 or 60s\nwhen small changes were also made to her foredeck, both to the designs of Alan Buchanan.</p>\n<p>Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine by the\nwith q Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural repairs were performed during\nthe winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings and doubling several ribs.</p>\n<p>In 2012, she was re-caulked by Paul Drake of Tollesbury and given a new sail plan by\nMark Butler of James Lawrence. This necessitated a new gaff, made by owner using a\nbirdsmouth construction and the one fitted is the prototype, which by 2022 had done 10 seasons.</p>\n<p>Previous sail dimensions: Mainsail Head: 9.17 ft Topsail Perpendicular: 6ft Topsail luff 13 ft</p>\n<p>Deck beam replaced and other repairs winter 2017/18.
