Economy limited the size to less than\n23'' overall, while a plea from the Shipmate was more or less an order for 6ft headroom.\"</p>\n<p>The preceding extract from the February 1937 issue of Yachting Monthly was penned\nby Maurice Griffith.</p>\n<p><em>Robinetta</em> was designed from the outset for single handing, with all lines except\nthe jib halyard let to the cockpit. She was strongly built with pine planking on\nan oak and elm frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead ballast. Her main\ncabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems from the extension of\nthe hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on to say, \"Perhaps the\nmost striking feature of this experimental design is the fullness of the hull, the\npronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships aft, and the enormous quarters,\nwhich appear to be based on those of the French crabbers.\"</p>\n<p><em>Robinetta</em> is mostly original, but her iron keel was replaced by lead in the 1950\nor 60s when small changes were also made to her foredeck, both to the designs of\nAlan Buchanan.</p>\n<p>Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine with\na Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural repairs were performed\nduring the winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings and doubling several\nribs.</p>\n<p>In 2012, she was re-caulked by Paul Drake of Tollesbury and given a new sail plan\nby Mark Butler of James Lawrence. This necessitated a new gaff, made by owner using\na birdsmouth construction and the one fitted is the prototype, which by 2022 had\ndone 10 seasons.</p>\n<p>Previous sail dimensions: Mainsail Head: 9.17 ft Topsail Perpendicular: 6ft Topsail\nluff 13 ft.</p>\n<p>Deck beam replaced and other repairs winter 2017/18.
