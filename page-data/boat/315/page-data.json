Economy limited the size to less than 23''\noverall, while a plea from the Shipmate was more or less an order for 6ft\nheadroom.\"</p>\n<p>The preceding extract from the February 1937 issue of Yachting Monthly was\npenned by Maurice Griffith.</p>\n<p>*Robinetta* was designed from the outset for single handing, with all lines\nexcept the jib halyard let to the cockpit. She was strongly built with pine\nplanking on an oak and elm frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead\nballast. Her main cabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems\nfrom the extension of the hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on\nto say, \"Perhaps the most striking feature of this experimental design is the\nfullness of the hull, the pronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships\naft, and the enormous quarters, which appear to be based on those of the French\ncrabbers.\"</p>\n<p>*Robinetta* is mostly original, but her iron keel was replaced by lead in the\n1950 or 60s when small changes were also made to her foredeck, both to the\ndesigns of Alan Buchanan.</p>\n<p>Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine\nwith a Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit. Major structural repairs were\nperformed during the winter of 2007/2008 strengthening the keel fixings and\ndoubling several ribs.</p>\n<p>In 2012, she was re-caulked by Paul Drake of Tollesbury and given a new sail\nplan by Mark Butler of James Lawrence. This necessitated a new gaff, made by\nowner using a birdsmouth construction and the one fitted is the prototype, which\nby 2022 had done 10 seasons.</p>\n<p>Previous sail dimensions: Mainsail Head: 9.17 ft Topsail Perpendicular: 6ft\nTopsail luff 13 ft.</p>\n<p>Deck beam replaced and other repairs winter 2017/18.
