In 2018 she was bought by Arnside Sailing Club with the help of a Heritage Lottery grant to have an example of a Crossfield’s boat in the village.</p>\n<p>Crossfields were the leading builders of Morecambe Bay Prawners. They also built yachts, rowing boats and dinghies, including Arthur Ransome’s 'Swallow' and 'Coch-y-bonddhu'. There were two boatyards operated by Crossfields in Arnside. Beach Walk on the shore ran by William where 'Severn' was built and Top Shop on Church Hill which was run by his younger brothers and then his nephews as Crossfield Brothers.</p>\n<p>'Severn' is one of ten Rivers Class Yachts built by William Crossfield and Sons for the River Mersey Yacht Club. Six were built in 1912 with a further Four in 1914. If it was not for the First World War it is probable that more would have been built. Four other Rivers Class yachts are thought to be still in existence: '<a href=\"http://www.oga.org.uk/boat/deva\">Deva</a>', '<a href=\"http://www.oga.org.uk/boat/dart\">Dart</a>', '<a href=\"http://www.oga.org.uk/boat/styx\">Styx</a>' (all on the OGA Register) and 'Esk'.</p>\n<p>The River Class were used largely for evening racing with a season running from May to July, with regatta race in July. The boats were also raced in August at the Straits Regatta on Anglesey. They were raced for prize money. In 1914 prize money was £44 when the average wage was £67. The Royal Mersey Yacht Club was based in Rock Ferry, a then prosperous area of Birkenhead with large houses overlooking the river.</p>\n<p>The design was based upon the Blackpool and Fleetwood Jewel Class. The boats were originally opened decked. They had a crew of three. The boats cost £50 each delivered afloat with a further £14.18s for the sails.</p>\n<p>Original owners of Rivers Class boats included members of the Liverpool merchant elite, three silver medallists in the 1908 Olympics, one of whom was also a Rugby Union International and a British Lions manager. In 1925 the 17th Earl of Derby, who was Commodore of the Royal Mersey Yacht Club and Secretary of State for War 1916-18 and a leading racehorse breeder brought Ogwen, followed by 'Deva' in 1926. The Derby in the title refers to the West Derby area of Lancashire, which includes Liverpool &nbsp;rather than the city.</p>\n<p>Severn was originally called \"Elwy\" after a river in North Wales. &nbsp;Her first owner was Lionel Yates Stott (1879 – 1944) of West Kirby. His father, who owned an iron foundry in Rossendale, died when Lionel was 10 leaving £27,266 (about £3.5 million). Lionel had a master mariner’s certificate. Along with three other River Class owners, Lionel signed up as a Lieutenant in RNR on August 5th 1914, the day after the war broke out<em>.</em>Elwy was the joint winner of the 1913 Rivers Class series, winning the Belcher Cup. Her prize money for the year was £10 10s (£1200 in 2020 prices).</p>\n<p>In 1914 she was sold to CaptainHarvey Broadbent RNR of HMS Conway, a merchant navy training ship anchored off Rock Ferry and a stern disciplinarian. She was named Ribble, after the river that flows through Preston. Ribble capsized iand sunk in a Royal Mersey Race on 23 July 1914 just 11 days before the outbreak of World War One in very windy conditions when rounding a buoy. Her crew made up of Commander Broadbent and two cadets were rescued..</p>\n<p>In 1927 she was discovered on the bed of the River Mersey and raised to the surface by the Mersey Docks Board salvage boat “Salvor”. She was found to be in good condition and sold by the Receiver of Wrecks to Joe Wallace, aged 25 of New Brighton, a member of the West Cheshire Yacht Club for £25. Joe Wallace named the boat 'Severn'. He is known to have sailed Severn with friends to Rhyl at Whitsun 1928 and to Mostyn the following year camping out in the boat. &nbsp;It is thought that Joe Wallace did not keep her for very long, moving on to bigger yachts. Joe went onto become Commodore of West Cheshire Yacht Club. 'Severn' is next recorded in 1939 winning a race at the West Cheshire Regatta at New Brighton and coming second in a race at Blundellsands near Formby north of Liverpool.</p>\n<p>By the early 1970s Severn was in North Wales. In 1972 Severn was advertised for sale by A.G.Taylor of Plas Mor, Borth y Gest, a village on a sheltered bay south of Portmadog in Wales overlooked by the hills of Snowdonia for £650. Severn was brought by John Gaynor of Leigh on Sea near Southend. Severn was briefly known as Rosevern.</p>\n<p>Mr Gaynor did not keep Severn for all that long, advertising her for sale for £1100 in 1976, Boat details include a cooker and tiolet. She was brought by Ken Tomlinson of Hockley, north of Southend. Around 1980 Severn featured in an article in the Longshoreman Magazine. Severn was kept at Paglesham on the Roach Estuary.</p>\n<p>In 1984.Ken Tomlinson advertised her for sale for £2000. She was brought by a young Americain lady with two children for £750 at Heybridge Basin who used her as a family boat and for racing enjoying many splendid adventures. Eventually she sold Severn on to a senoir Fire Officer.</p>\n<p>Jon Wainwright, owner of 'Deva', another Rivers Class yacht, mentions competing against 'Severn' in a race in 1986 on the River Blackwater in his book “Only so Many Tides”.
