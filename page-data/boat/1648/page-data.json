During four years of rebuilding she had new deck beams, deck, bear, shelf, breast hook, mast and rigging plus spars.  She sank in a gale in 1980 but was refloated and has had a new rudder fitted.  Her history tells us that she was a smack yacht at Wallasea Island in the Crouch, her names have been Six Bells, Johnny Belinda and Zareha. She was towed into the Crouch in 1954 by the Clacton Lifeboat when she was named Johnny Belinda, but the present owner is trying to find out more about her.","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":null,"draft":0,"generic_type":"Smack","handicap_data":{"length_over_all":9.44891489880517},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.4488,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-01-31T17:02:50.852645+00:00","website":"","beam":0,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":null,"designer":null,"design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":null,"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Smack"},"builderByBuilder":null,"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
