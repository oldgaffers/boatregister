The Highlanders are a primarily dayboat range, though the smallest is pehaps closer to dinghy and the largest ia weekender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was built by two sailing enthusiasts who are high quality woodworkers, specialising mostly in church fitting, so she was built well and beautifully. She&#39;s wood-epoxy, mostly in ply and painted with `Perfection 709&#39;, but with the brightwork mostly in solid timber. To get an idea of the standard, have a look at the `barleytwist&#39; mast support inside the cuddy and the thwart,&nbsp; carved and inlaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;standard&#39; Highlander design uses a spritsail rig, but it also has lugger and gunter variations of which &#39;Egret&#39; uses the latter variation. Egret&#39;s internal layout has also been extensively adapted from the original design by the use of a different locker top construction and pumped ballast tanks rather than the standard self-filling and emptying design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cuddy really is just that and no more on the Highlander 18, so this really is an open boat. Only the 19&#39;6&quot; version that has a true (small) cabin. On &#39;Egret&#39;, the builders decided to reduce the cuddy a little more, and then &#39;overcompensate&#39;, by adding a very generous spray hood that together with the cuddy encloses quite a long space, nearly half the length of the cockpit. Plenty long enough for camping and the &#39;zip in back&#39; gives a good volume and passable privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also has a cockpit tent with&nbsp;full sitting headroom over the whole cockpit area. Startlingly spacious and quite cosy, it&#39;s a good solid canvas tent, proofed and fairly easy to set. Both spray hood and tent are arch-topped, rather than over-boom, to ensure good headroom. The sides on the tent may each be rolled up, as may be the after panel, giving plenty of ventilation options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has loads of locker space along both side seats and across the centre of the cuddy. One, to starboard, contains a Porta-Potti. The extreme fore-peak and extreme stern comprise sealed boyancy tanks, so she has buoyancy aplenty. Ballast is 400lb of water stored in a centreline tank. The design calls for fill and empty holes, but the builders preferred to pump the water in and out, so she has twin diaphragm-type pumps that can be either fill/empty the tanks, or both can bale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The father and son who built her did a superb job. The scantlings were all increased a little and all the epoxy fillets are pretty much perfect. Even the reinforcing pads (for everything) are filleted and sanded smooth. Wow! It was their idea to make the cuddy a little smaller and fit a large generous spray-hood. Good move!</p>","image_key":"pnpZLT","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Ply epoxy","draft":0.7315,"generic_type":"Dayboat","handicap_data":{"moving_keel":true,"length_overall":5.4864,"draft_keel_down":1.3716,"moving_keel_type":"Centreboard","length_over_spars":6.7056,"length_on_waterline":4.8768},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.4864,"mainsail_type":"gunter","sail_type":{"name":"gunter"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Egret&#39; is a Highlander 18 designed by Selway Fisher Design and built by two sailing enthusiasts to an exceptional standard in 2005.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"https://www.gscott.me.uk/Egret/","beam":1.905,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"9df0ef19-2255-497e-b6d6-8e8918a14d44","designer":"de6ce395-680c-46f9-a90f-180310b55e8a","design_class":"df233c68-2959-4b82-aee9-cd3421af749c","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"woodepoxy"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Highlander 18"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Paul Fisher"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Yawl"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Dayboat"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Mark Hampton/Phil Hampton","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":0,"flexibility":"normal","offered":null,"price_flexibility":{"text":"normal"},"reduced":false,"sales_text":"<p>\"Egret\" is a Highlander 18 design by Selway Fisher Design, built 2000-2005.
