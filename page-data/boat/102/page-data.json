She was evidently kept in the Medway until purchased by Prior of Burnham, from whom she was bought in 1936 for a total sum of Â£50.  She was then kept at Burnham, where she was used as a day sailer and weekend cruiser.  The mast was originally mounted on a tabernacle, which possibly at one time enabled her to get under the bridge's Rochester.  This was removed because it let in too much water.  In 1937 the cabin was raised 3 inches and 5 inches aft to give comfortable sitting headroom.
