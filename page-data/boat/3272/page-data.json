Several clinker Bawleys of\nthe same size were constructed in Gravesend at this time including <em>Lilian</em>,\n<em>Highland Mary</em> and <em>Charlotte</em>.\u00a0 All of these, including <em>Fiddle</em> are well\nreferenced in numerous text books, many of which are still in print.</p>\n<p><em>Fiddle</em> was registered as LO 155 and fished under sail alone, trawling for\nshrimps predominantly, in the lower reaches of the Thames estuary from the\n1860\u2019s right up to the start of WW2 when shrimping had to stop due to a\nprotective barrage in the Thames.\u00a0 It is believed that her first auxiliary\nengine was installed in the 1930\u2019s.</p>\n<p>After the end of the war, she was sold and transferred to Whitstable to dredge\nfor oysters and re-registered to Faversham with the number F124, which she still\ndisplays.\u00a0 She was then taken down to Brixam, Devon in the late 1950\u2019s/early\n60\u2019s and has remained in the West Country ever since.</p>\n<p>Bawleys are generally loose footed cutter rigged with disproportionately tall\ntop-masts to catch the higher breezes, often encountered in estuaries and river\nsailing.\u00a0 With this rig, the mainsail can be brailed up to the mast allowing\nexceptional control in congested waters.\u00a0 They are shallow drafted with a wide\nbeam and pleasing lines.\u00a0 <em>Fiddle</em> maintains this original form of rig with a\nlong bowsprit, tall topmast and loose footed main.</p>\n<p><em>Fiddle</em> is currently moored in The Floating Harbour at Bristol. She has been\nunder the guardianship of the current owner for the last 10 years during which\ntime she has undergone significant restoration work and routine maintenance\nunder the guidance of Mark Rolt at Bristol Classic Boats.\u00a0 Recent work (2022-23)\nhas included significant replanking, repairs and renewal of deck beams, complete\nrebuild of fwd coachroof and complete re-decking. Repaint and\noverhaul/varnishing of spars.\u00a0 Standing rigging replaced by Traditional Rigging\n(Bristol) in 2016.</p>\n<p>'Fiddle' was built and fished from Gravesend, shrimping and stowboating until\npurchased by Ralf Chandler in 1952, who took her to Whistable and dredged for\noysters during the 1950s. He re-registered her on Part 1 Swansea as F127.</p>\n<p>Chandler took her to Brixham in the late 1960s early 1970s. She was owned by\nseveral people between the 1970s and 2000 and had various work carried out which\nwas left incomplete, leading to further deterioration.</p>\n<p>She was purchased by Andy Cornish and his father and much work was carried out\nby them under the guidance of David Patient. She was then sold to Robert Lee and\nHazel Brickhill in about 2008. They sailed her to Bristol where she was in the\nfloating harbour for several years.</p>\n<p>Adam Cloote bought <em>Fiddle</em> in October 2014. In spring 2015 she was taken out of\nthe water when rot was found in the original elm planking and some later Douglas\nfir in the bows. All this has been replaced by Mark Rolt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the current owners are now unable to complete their plans to\nretire early and enjoy sailing <em>Fiddle</em> at their leisure.\u00a0 Consequently, they\nare seeking to find sympathetic new owners who will appreciate this beautiful,\nhistorically important, yet unassuming vessel.\u00a0 Fiddle will only be sold to the\n\u201cright\u201d purchaser</p>", "generic_type": "Bawley", "handicap_data": {"beam": 3.658, "draft": 1.219, "fore_triangle_base": 6.096, "fore_triangle_height": 6.096, "length_on_deck": 8.839, "length_on_waterline": 8.687, "length_over_spars": 12.802, "length_overall": 8.839, "main": {"foot": 4.877, "head": 5.486, "luff": 5.715}, "topsail": {"luff": 25, "perpendicular": 13}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Bristol", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "10a0af9c-7baa-4bef-9d8c-79c7bdc25664", "image_key": "JrdXQ4", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "mmsi": "232015152", "name": "Fiddle", "oga_no": 3272, "ownerships": [{"name": "Ralf Chandler", "note": "Purchased by Ralf Chandler in 1952, sold in the 1970's and had several owners.", "start": 1952}, {"end": 2014, "name": "Judy Brickhill And Robert Lee", "note": "Bought by Andy Cornish and his father who sold her to Judy Brickhill and Robert Lee in about 2008.
