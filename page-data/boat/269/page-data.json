A.M Gostelow was born in 1880 in Rosegarth Street,\nBoston. Between 1901 and 1948 when he died, A.M Gostelow built about 28 fishing\nsmacks and 15 yachts. Lillibullero was built as the second of three sister\nships. The third yacht of this threesome, <em>Eleanor</em>, which was slightly bigger\nwas sailed to North America in 1978/1979 but struck a reef in the Caribbean and\nsank.</p>\n<p>The first of the three sisters was <em>Privateer</em>. She was built in 1931 for H.A\nKemlo, an Ipswich solicitor. For a long time (1966 - 1998) Privateer was owned\nby Martin Eve who recorded his adventures with <em>Privateer</em> in \u201cAn Old Gaffer's\nTale\u201d (Seafarer Books, 1984). The book shows a picture of <em>Lillibullero</em> moored\nat Pin Mill on the River Orwell just before she was sold in 1977 to a Dutch\nowner. <em>Lillibullero</em> and <em>Privateer</em> met again at the Shotley Point Classic\nBoat festival in 1995.</p>\n<p>W.H Johnston gave a fine account of building and fitting out <em>Lillibullero</em> in\nthe classic book \u201cBuilding a Little Ship\u201d (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1935). A\nfirst print copy of the book, signed by the author, belongs to the ship's\ninventory. In this book Mr Johnston wanted to show 'that a decent cruising yacht\nwith engine and all the necessary equipment could be built and fitted out for\nthe price of a medium-sized car' That is in the 1930s. Actually the building and\nfitting out of <em>Lillibullero</em> summed up to \u00a3298 and two shillings. Four opening\nports that Johnston bought second hand in Brentford remain in use on board.\n<em>Lillibullero</em> features in \u201cGaff-rigged out of Boston\u201d, a small paperback by S.R\nWright published in 1991.</p>\n<p><em>Lillibullero</em> is not known for her famous voyages yet she is a very solid and\ntrustworthy little gaffer. With her first Dutch owner, Ab Venstra, who bought\nher on his honeymoon, she was shipwrecked on the East Coast of England. Her\ntransom, several frames and planks were replaced. Ab Venstra also lowered the\ncoachroof before he sailed her back to Holland losing some headroom but gaining\na lot in looks. In 1990/1991 she needed major maintenance. Peter Kruitwagen and\nGosine Broersen replaced her stem timber, cockpit and interior. They also\nrepaired several frames and planks. Over the years (1990-2010) Peter and Gosine\nreplaced about 30% of her hull planking. During the 1990s <em>Lillibullero</em> has\nbeen back to England twice to visit the Shotley Classic Boat and Beer festival.\nShe also attended every Dutch Classic Yacht Regatta at Hellevoetsluis from 1991\nto 2009.</p>", "generic_type": "Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.896, "draft": 1.433, "length_on_deck": 9.754, "length_on_waterline": 8.83930748597903, "length_over_all": 9.75371860521824, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Holbrook", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "66da7f6b-2fc5-4bea-bf33-34578dc75fbb", "image_key": "R9hDWX", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Lillibullero", "oga_no": 269, "ownerships": [{"end": 1947, "name": "W.H.Johnston", "share": 64, "start": 1932}, {"end": 1956, "name": "Charles Dearlove", "share": 32, "start": 1947}, {"end": 1977, "name": "Archie Campbell", "share": 32, "start": 1956}, {"end": 1989, "name": "Ab Venstra", "share": 64, "start": 1977}, {"end": 2010, "name": "Gosine Borersen", "share": 32, "start": 1989}, {"end": 2010, "name": "Peter Kruitwagen", "share": 32, "start": 1989}, {"end": 2011, "name": "Fiona Mary Lucas", "share": 64, "start": 2010}, {"end": "2022", "name": "Michael Robertson", "share": "64", "start": 2011}, {"current": true, "name": " Thomas Morley", "share": 64, "start": 2022}], "place_built": "Boston", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p><em>Lillibullero</em> is one of many boats on the East Coast of England who has crossed\nthe North Sea and back several times throughout her history.
