A.M Gostelow was born in 1880 in Rosegarth Street, Boston. Between 1901 and 1948 when he died, A.M Gostelow built about 28 fishing smacks and 15 yachts.Lillibullero was built as the second of three sister ships. The third yacht of\nthis threesome, Eleanor, which was slightly bigger was sailed to North America\nin 1978/1979 but struck a reef in the Caribbean and sank. The first of the three\nsisters was Privateer. She was built in 1931 for H.A Kemlo, an Ipswich\nsolicitor. For a long time (1966 - 1998) Privateer was owned by Martin Eve who\nrecorded his adventures with Privateer in &amp;ldquotAn Old Gaffer's Tale&amp;rdquot\n(Seafarer Books, 1984). The book shows a picture of Lillibullero moored at Pin\nMill on the River Orwell just before she was sold in 1977 to a Dutch owner.\nLillibullero and Privateer met again at the Shotley Point Classic Boat festival\nin 1995.W.H Johnston gave a fine account of building and fitting out\nLillibullero in the classic book &amp;ldquotBuilding a Little Ship&amp;rdquot (George\nAllen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1935). A first print copy of the book, signed by the author,\nbelongs to the ship's inventory. In this book Mr Johnston wanted to show 'that a\ndecent cruising yacht with engine and all the necessary equipment could be built\nand fitted out for the price of a medium-sized car' That is in the 1930s.\nActually the building and fitting out of Lillibullero summed up to \u00a3298 and two\nshillings. Four opening ports that Johnston bought second hand in Brentford\nremain in use on board.  Lillibullero features in \u2018Gaff-rigged out of Boston\u2019, a\nsmall paperback by S.R Wright published in 1991. Lillibullero is not known for\nher famous voyages yet she is a very solid and trustworthy little gaffer.  With\nher first Dutch owner, Ab Venstra, who bought her on his honeymoon, she was\nshipwrecked on the East Coast of England. Her transom, several frames and planks\nwere replaced. Ab Venstra also lowered the coachroof before he sailed her back\nto Holland losing some headroom but gaining a lot in looks. In 1990/1991 she\nneeded major maintenance.  Peter Kruitwagen and Gosine Broersen replaced her\nstem timber, cockpit and interior. They also repaired several frames and planks.\nOver the years (1990-2010) Peter and Gosine replaced about 30% of her hull\nplanking. During the 1990s Lillibullero has been back to England twice to visit\nthe Shotley Classic Boat and Beer festival. She also attended every Dutch\nClassic Yacht Regatta at Hellevoetsluis from 1991 to 2009..</p>", "generic_type": "Smack", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.8956, "draft": 1.4326, "length_on_deck": 9.7536, "length_on_waterline": 8.83930748597903, "length_over_all": 9.75371860521824, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Holbrook", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "66da7f6b-2fc5-4bea-bf33-34578dc75fbb", "image_key": "R9hDWX", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Lillibullero", "oga_no": 269, "ownerships": [{"end": 1947, "name": "W.H.Johnston", "share": 64, "start": 1932}, {"end": 1956, "name": "Charles Dearlove", "share": 32, "start": 1947}, {"end": 1977, "name": "Archie Campbell", "share": 32, "start": 1956}, {"end": 1989, "name": "Ab Venstra", "share": 64, "start": 1977}, {"end": 2010, "name": "Gosine Borersen", "share": 32, "start": 1989}, {"end": 2010, "name": "Peter Kruitwagen", "share": 32, "start": 1989}, {"end": 2011, "name": "Fiona Mary Lucas", "share": 64, "start": 2010}, {"end": "2022", "name": "Michael Robertson", "share": "64", "start": 2011}], "place_built": "Boston", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Lillibullero is one of many boats on the East Coast of England who has crossed\nthe North Sea and back several times throughout her history.
