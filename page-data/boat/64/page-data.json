An extra suit of sails had been cut, but no hull built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer of 1939, when owned by Surgeon Commander Curjel of Woodbridge, she cruised to Portsmouth, but on her return was caught by the onset of war and laid up at Dover where she was damaged by enemy shells. Refitted after the war and bought by Mr. Titheridge in 1948, she was sailed extensively in home waters during pub closing hours and occasionally as far as the Isle of Wight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Winner of the OGA Seamanship Cup in 1969 and 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was lying in Heybridge Basin for several years, in need of someone to complete her restoration and in 2017, she was taken on by Thomas Morley and moved to Devon.&nbsp;</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.0726, "draft": 0.8534, "fore_triangle_base": 2.7676176542306754, "fore_triangle_height": 6.224091684954889, "length_on_deck": 6.4922, "length_on_waterline": 5.651060716898317, "length_over_all": 6.4770787612777365, "main": {"foot": 5.303584491587417, "head": 5.510851011948304, "luff": 2.996220434040478}, "propellor": {"type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 32.05080639001748, "thcf": 0.893}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Topsham, Devon", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "id": "016bb845-c145-422e-b80a-95581e7508d3", "image_key": "GMm7sm", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Sea Pig", "oga_no": 64, "ownerships": [{"end": 2017, "id": 20, "member": 505, "share": 64, "start": 1984}, {"end": 1984, "name": "Titheridge", "share": 64, "start": 1948}, {"name": "Thomas Morley", "share": 64, "start": 2017}], "place_built": "Woodbridge", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "CC4", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>&#39;Sea Pig&#39; was built in 1930&nbsp;by Eversons of Woodbridge, Suffolk and has the class and sail number 4.</p>", "ssr": "SSR37300", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-s2mBGjr/0/Th/i-s2mBGjr-Th.jpg", "uk_part1": "SSR37300", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1930, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/64"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
