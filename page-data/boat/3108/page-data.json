When he heard this, Harrison Butler placed an order for the first boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Vindilis&#39; is the first Moody. Her sister ship &#39;Lindy 2&#39; was build number 3 and is also berthed in Emsworth Yacht Harbour. &#39;Lindy&#39; still has her original rig but the previous owner&nbsp;converted &#39;Vindilis&#39; to a cutter and she has been left in this form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harrison Butler contributed at least two articles to Yachting Monthly in 1935 and 1936. One of these compares the performance of &#39;Vindilis&#39; with a Bermudan yawl rig against his previous gaffer &#39;Sandook&#39; (unsurprisingly, faster upwind but downwind the gaffer had the edge). This article reflected much of the debate at the time regarding the new Bermudan. In another article, a cruise through the Naval Review of 1937 is described with battleships moored the length of the Solent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The previous two owners based &#39;Vindilis&#39; on the Clyde.
