Her dimensions would have allowed her to have raced in the 25ft waterline class popular in the 1880s or perhaps in the 2.5 rating class popular in the 1890&#39;s. Her Lloyds registration certificate dates back to 1917 and Lloyds registers of Yachts include a Kestrel of very similar dimensions back to 1904, always being based on the East Coast. Any earlier history is unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past owners include the nautical authors George Arnott, Harvey Benham and Richard Woodman. Kestrel reached her 100th year in a rather sorry state of repair. By the 1960s she was leaking badly and in an effort to preserve her she was sheathed in glass fibre. This enabled her to continue sailing until 1991 when she was deemed too&nbsp;unsound to continue afloat. Her engine was Coventry Victor, Petrol, 3.5 of 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchased by James Palmer for &pound;1 in 1997 she was largely rebuilt over the next four years. Kestrel is constructed of teak planking on oak timbers. Originally built without a ballast keel, a ton of lead was bolted to the original elm keel prior to 1930 along with various lead infills presumably to improve her stability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She now has an opepe keel supporting the same lead ballast. The deck was replaced and constructed of Russian deal on plywood, the lay of the deck being similar to that removed and typical of the period. Of the original boat only two thirds of the planking, tiller, mast and boom remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kestrel&#39;s current rig (2013) is around 620 square ft. Enlarged slightly from the 1991 rig it is still somewhat smaller than the 800 square ft listed in 1904. Kestrel took part in the first East Coast Old Gaffers Race in 1963 and the 2013 OGA Jubilee Celebrations in Cowes and East Coast Race.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.5146, "draft": 1.1674, "fore_triangle_base": 4.57205559619605, "fore_triangle_height": 8.382101926359423, "length_on_deck": 8.4064, "length_on_waterline": 7.620092660326749, "length_over_all": 8.40648622287247, "length_over_spars": 11.582540843696659, "main": {"foot": 5.6388685686417945, "head": 4.57205559619605, "luff": 4.87685930260912}, "propellor": {"type": "folding"}, "sailarea": 47.080329271090456, "thcf": 0.96}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Waldringfield", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "532dbad7-9ab2-4915-b9bc-6655142b3db7", "image_key": "9tg58q", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Kestrel", "oga_no": 933, "ownerships": [{"note": "Owners include:", "text": "Owners include:"}, {"end": 1934, "note": "1932-1934 W George Arnott", "start": 1932, "text": "W George Arnott"}, {"end": 1935, "note": "1934-1935 Hervey Benham", "start": 1934, "text": "Hervey Benham"}, {"end": 1960, "note": "1935-1960  John Howard", "start": 1935, "text": "John Howard"}, {"end": 1971, "note": "1965-1971 Richard Dale", "start": 1965, "text": "Richard Dale"}, {"end": 1997, "note": "1975-1997 Richard Woodman", "start": 1975, "text": "Richard Woodman"}, {"current": true, "id": 396, "member": 4172, "share": 64, "start": 1997}, {"note": "1997-          James Palmer", "start": 1997, "text": "James Palmer"}], "place_built": "Cowes IoW", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "Kestrel is understood to have been built in 1891 by John White of Cowes.
