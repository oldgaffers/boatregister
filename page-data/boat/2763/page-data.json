Morecambe was popular with holidaymakers from Bradford and was often known as &#39;Bradford by the Sea&#39;.&nbsp;The naming of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; was attended by the Lord Mayors of Bradford and Leeds and she was paraded through the streets of Morecambe and Heysham watched by 20,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six or more replicas have been made of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; in glass fibre using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric Bergqvist, a Cheshire boatbuilder in return for royalties of &pound;25 for every boat built.
