Morecambe was popular with holidaymakers from Bradford and was often known as &#39;Bradford by the Sea&#39;.&nbsp;The naming of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; was attended by the Lord Mayors of Bradford and Leeds and she was paraded through the streets of Morecambe and Heysham watched by 20,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six or more replicas have been made of the &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; in glass fibre using a mould taken from the boat in 1979 by Eric Bergqvist, a Cheshire boatbuilder in return for royalties of &pound;25 for every boat built. The &#39;Sir William Priestley&#39; was retired from service in 1987 and taken to Lancaster Maritime Museum to await restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Alasdair Simpson, Arnside Sailing Club, September 2018</h4>\r\n</blockquote>","image_key":"Kxt9PQ","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"unknown","construction_details":"GRP","draft":1.0668,"generic_type":"Morecambe Bay Prawner","handicap_data":{"beam":2.8956352109241648,"main":{"foot":4.87685930260912,"luff":4.191050963179712},"thcf":0.81453048,"draft":1.066812972445745,"topsail":{"luff":4.800658376005852,"perpendicular":0.8717386003413801},"length_over_all":8.382101926359423,"length_on_waterline":7.162887100707144},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.382,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"'Minx' is a GRP Morecambe Bay Prawner built from a mould taken from the 'William Priestley' the Morecambe Bay Fishermen's Association's private lifeboat which served from 1934 to 1989.
