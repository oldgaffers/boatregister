Lewis Alexander wanted a boat that could beat &#39;Alpha&#39;,and in November 1911 the result, &#39;Kindly Light&#39; ,was launched and sailed to Barry in south Wales. Costing &pound;500, about 40% more than her contemporary cutters, she had a fine high bow, lean entry and well hollowed lines below the waterline, which blended into her deep keel. She represents the final evolution of the Bristol Channel sailing pilot cutter and was considered to be the fastest and most successful of over 100 pilot cutters working in the Bristol Channel immediately before the First World War.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1960 &#39;Theodora&#39; was the founding vessel of the Ocean Youth Club (later known as the Ocean Youth Trust) and took young people to sea for eleven years before being sold to the Maritime Trust in 1971.
