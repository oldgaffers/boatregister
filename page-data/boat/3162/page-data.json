It gives more headroom\nand space inside and she still keeps her typical rounded skin. In 2009 the keel\nwas laid in the yard of Gerard Kroes, in Leeuwarden, and during the following\nyears Rik finished her ready to launch in 2012.</p>\n<p>The aim of the fully decked copy was the wish to sail her further away from\nhome waters in Holland.\nSo the second year of her floating existence she joined the OGA Round Britain\nChallenge in 2013.
