They bought the boat in 1911 and cruised her around the Solent and down the West Country. In 1912 they sailed up to the Baltic to Copenhagen. The trip is recorded in the CA Bulletin and an original log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 1913 they returned and sailed her up to Russia at Kronstadt before returning to Cowes on September 23rd. They met Erskine Childers in Kalmar on July 29th. Both Carson and Childers record the meeting in their logs. Carson won the CA&#39;s Love Cup in 1912 and 1913 for their cruise and the RCC&#39;s Romola Cup in 1913. In October 1919 they sailed from Cowes to Le Havre, taking the boat down the French Canals to the Mediterranean arriving in January 1920. Carson then sailed the boat to Sete and took her through the Canal du Midi to Bordeaux. From there in August 1920 he and Beryl sailed the boat back to England. This trip is described in 6 Yachting Monthly articles published in 1921 and 1922. They sold the boat in January 1922.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Carson she had three owners in quick succession but in 1932 she was bought by Joseph Mew, a brewer on the Isle of Wight. He sailed her in the early Round the Island Races. A Beken photograph survives from this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1939 she was sold and taken to the East Coast. In 1950 she was converted to Bermudan at Dan Web and Feesey, then bought by Edgar Traylen in 1960. Whilst on the slip being fitted out she was recognised by Carson&#39;s daughter and this is how her history came to light. Traylen kept her on the Walton Backwaters for 20 years before selling her to Richard Barnard who converted her back to a gaff cutter using the Bermudan mast. However the rig was not powerful and the boat needed a good breeze to get her going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pat and Dick Dawson bought her in 1983 and sailed her back to the South Coast. She leaked a lot on this trip, resulting in a three year refit In 1989 the Dawsons replaced the rig based on the dimensions of her original rig recorded in her 1911 log. In their ownership she has cruised the south coast of England from Ramsgate to the Helford river in Cornwall, across the Channel to Normandy, the Channel Islands and the North Brittany coast.</p>","image_key":"nNtLcZ","uk_part1":"128988","spar_material":"wood","rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel pine on oak, elm keel, external lead keel, no internal ballast, teak brightwork.","draft":1.6764,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.743257742014143,"main":{"foot":5.054675688856376,"head":4.191069251402097,"luff":5.359479395269446},"thcf":0.953,"draft":1.6764325774201414,"topsail":{"luff":5.791294806144842,"perpendicular":2.0828456474030723},"sailarea":54.809497755984346,"propellor":{"type":"fixed","blades":3},"length_over_all":8.051908071202146,"length_over_spars":10.363350402340892,"fore_triangle_base":4.775274323335771,"length_on_waterline":7.620092660326749,"fore_triangle_height":9.753742989514752},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.0528,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>One off design probably based on the Poole fishing boats/pilot boats of the time.
