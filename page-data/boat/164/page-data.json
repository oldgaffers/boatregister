His voyages are brought to life in a series of extremely readable and popular books in which he described various passages. Mulville's voyages included several single-handed transatlantic crossings, a circumnavigation of Iceland and a cruise to Argentina. They are beautifully captured in his books which give testament to Iskra's sailing characteristics and seaworthiness.</p><p>Nick Zienau bought Iskra in 1998 and she needed a refit which involved replacing the iron floors, checking keelbolts and re-covering the pine deck with marine ply and glass cloth in epoxy along with an entirely new cockpit, new tanks (diesel, gas and paraffin), rewiring the electrics and a new interior in marine ply with ash tongue and groove lining. The boom, bowsprit and gaff were also replaced, and she had new sails in 2014.</p><p>Since the refit she has cruised to Brittany, the English West country, the Netherlands and spent three seasons in the Baltic.
