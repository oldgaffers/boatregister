Over 2000 volunteers joined and soon formed groups, each was in charge of producing a different part of the whole, since there was no budget.  It all came from volunteers and donations.  A local log home building company provided the lumber.  Lead ballast, a sail, all safety equipment all came from local companies.  Groups made their own oars.  A family from a Maple Ridge area farm donated a tree from their back yard, which became the mast.  Others produced decorations such as shields and costumes.  A local carver designed and carved the dragon figureheads for prow and stern and another carver made nameplates and bowplates, and carved a runic message in the mast.  Folks worked evenings and weekends over the course of about 10 months, with lots of speeches, discussions and ceremonies along the way, and for the launch lots of media and dignitaries joined the parade.  We sail almost every weekend for 2-hour trips, inviting the public to join us.  It’s been quite a ride, and we’re not done yet, so come down and join us for a sail. www.vikingship.ca","image_key":null,"thumb":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":null,"construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"clinker","construction_details":"Clinker plank on Frame.
