She was probably built as one of the ship\u2019s boats for a minesweeper called <em>Melisande</em>. Apparently it was quite usual for Robertsons to get the order for the boats whenever a warship was being built further up the river. She was bought &nbsp;at a naval dispersal sail after the war when she was fitted with a centreboard and sails. Her owner kept her on the Walton &nbsp;Backwaters and sailed &nbsp;up and down the coast from Burnham to Southwold, before passing her on to his daughter and son in law.</p>\n<p>Regular mainenance at Halls Boatyard kept her sailing. The mast was replaced because it was rotten, various treatments were employed to stop her leaking, and after over 60 years in one family she was sold on in need of the plate case taking out and refitting, The joy of wooden boats!</p>", "handicap_data": {}, "home_port": "Solway Firth", "hull_form": "dinghy", "id": "790bdaa9-66d3-41d8-829b-e974643d18b5", "image_key": "XLh5tW", "mainsail_type": "lug", "name": "Melisande", "oga_no": 3515, "place_built": "Sandbank", "rig_type": "Yawl", "short_description": "<p>Built around 1913 as a Royal Navy ship's boat</p>", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-nsxSshF/0/Th/i-nsxSshF-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1913, "year_is_approximate": true}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3515"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
