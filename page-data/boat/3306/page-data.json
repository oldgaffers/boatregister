This included: had to look attractive, have good directional stability for rowing, sail well and accommodate four plus ample supplies when spectating at the annual Henley Regatta. The hull design was accepted and detailed drawings supplied. The proposed sail plan was first approved and then produced by Dick Batt Sails. Mast and spar with sail fit within boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building was undertaken as a retirement project and featured in Classic Boat Magazine with a sail test on the Thames. Greenwich was reached in three stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A single loose footed sail is carried on a long carbon fibre spar almost like a lateen sail, this enables the boat to be rowed with sail set without the risk of being injured by a boom. The un-stayed mast, designed to fit Thames bridges, also in carbon fibre is extremely light and very strong. Since reefing of the sail is not possible a second small sail is carried which can be laced direct to the mast for sailing in strong winds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boat has just a halyard, a main sheet, a double ended tack line and a line to recover the centre board, which includes inset lead ballast, back into the case. When tacking the end of the tensioned tack line is released, the spar pulled vertical and released to leeward of the mast, at the same time the end of the leeward tack line is tensioned. When sailing downwind the tack line can be eased away until almost a square sail results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short tacking is practical with the spar remaining to windward of the mast. &#39;Scala Nimbat&#39;a has taken part in La Semaine du Golfe Morbihan 2003 and 2007, Seafair Milford Haven 2006 and 2008, Fowey Classics 2008.</p>", "generic_type": "Yacht", "handicap_data": {"length_on_waterline": 4.7488, "length_over_spars": 4.95, "length_overall": 4.95, "main": {"foot": 13.12, "head": 15.42, "luff": 10.33}}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "a8214dff-1953-4430-a280-fd2b365a3903", "image_key": "5FRFxZ", "length_on_deck": 4.95, "mainsail_type": "lateen", "name": "Scala Nimbata", "oga_no": 3306, "ownerships": [{"name": "Patrick Hobbs", "share": 64, "start": 2001}, {"current": true, "member": 6075, "share": 64, "start": "?"}], "place_built": "Wargrave", "rig_type": "single_sail", "sail_number": "K 101", "short_description": "<p>&#39;Scala Nimbata&#39; was conceived, designed and built to sail and row the River Thames from source to tideway.</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "ssr": "104200", "thumb": "https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-fDS4kBR/0/Th/i-fDS4kBR-Th.jpg", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "website": "", "year": 2001, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3306"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
