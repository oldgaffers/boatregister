She is still\nvarnished inside and out. Her sail plan is very large for a boat of her size\nwhich makes her very quick and interesting to sail in strong wind conditions.</p>\n<p>During the 1980s, the East Coast OGA encouraged open boats to race in their\nrallies. <em>Bilanbil</em>, skippered by Clare Mackenzie with younger sister Tessa as\ncrew generally did well. Area Secretary, Jon Wainwright, reports on the open\nboats race during the Stour Rally, August 1987 in the OGA Newsletter 1987/4\n(forerunner of the Gaffers Log).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With five entries, this was better attended than last year. It might have been called <s>'</s>'Battle of the Sexes<s>'</s>', for three of the five boats were skippered by ladies. Extrapolate this to 60% of the EC Race fleet, and this will be more than the present EC Secretary's feeble ticker can stand.</p>\n<p>Clare Mackenzie in the Walton and Frinton OD made the running again this year, the experience of boat and waters showing through. Second place was closely fought between the delightful cutter-rigged winklebrig 'Gremlin and the Memory Class 'Old Pretender<s>'</s>' (leading male boat).</p>\n<p>Old Pretender<s>'</s>' should have taken it but made a mistake at Harkstead Beacon, and allowed Gremlin through. I thought the Aldeburgh OD 'Niad' had made a navigational error too, as she failed to turn at Harkstead. We chased after her, and when told of her error, the skipper, Paul Writtle said <s>'</s>'I know, I couldn't change course because we were changing nappies.<s>'</s>'</p>\n<p>Perhaps we should get Mothercare to sponsor Class III next year! Last boat in was the persistent Drascombe <s>'</s>'Belometje', taking some five hours to do the course. I noted the area publicity officer and mate were in her crew.</p>\n</blockquote>", "generic_type": "Half-decker", "handicap_data": {"beam": 1.829, "draft": 0.762, "length_on_deck": 5.486, "length_on_waterline": 5.105, "length_over_all": 5.486}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Pin Mill", "hull_form": "centre-boarder", "id": "174120e5-a697-4bc7-aea8-4de13ef4c884", "image_key": "rTqSXk", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Bilanbil", "oga_no": 1305, "ownerships": [{"current": true, "id": 1105, "member": 954, "share": 64, "start": 1985}], "place_built": "Walton-on-the-Naze", "rig_type": "Sloop", "sail_number": "5", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>'Bilanbil' is one of a few remaining Walton and Frinton One Designs, with sail\nno. 5, built by Halls at Walton-on-the-Naze.
