She was designed by James McGruer and built at McGruer and Co. of Clynder in 1938. 2017 finds her wintering in a shed at Rosneath, some 300 metres from where she was first launched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built as a private yacht along the lines of a Loch Fyne Skiff, &#39;Rowan&#39; is a very pretty boat. She is gaff-rigged with tan sails, a pronounced sheer, a canoe stern, wooden spars and gleaming mahogany topsides. She has been sensitively restored, 2011 - 2015 to reflect her McGruer heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was built for Dr R B Carslaw, a Glasgow surgeon who owned and sailed a series of four sailing boats, all called &#39;Rowan&#39;. He wrote a very readable account of his family sailing in these different boats on the west coast of Scotland in the 1920s and 1930s. This book, called &lsquo;Leaves from Rowans&rsquo; logs&rsquo; contains a detailed account of &#39;Rowan IV&#39; when she was built, and her first two summers on the west coast of Scotland.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Construction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Carvel built, with mahogany planking on 2 inch oak frames at 11 to 12 inch intervals. She has the tightly curved canoe stern and&nbsp; pronounced sheer typical of a Loch Fyne Skiff. The planking is splined above the waterline, and filled below. The topsides are in excellent condition and varnished to a high standard. There is a white boot-top, and red anti-foul below. Forward of the cockpit she has a characteristic McGruer semi-doghouse in teak which gives excellent standing cover against wind and spray, making a spray-hood unnecessary. In fact sitting in the cockpit at anchor, one always thinks that the wind has gone down!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has a long iron ballast keel weighing two and a quarter tons, with additional internal ballast in the form of lead blocks under the cabin sole.There are 16 wooden floors in good condition, with wooden bearers above these for the cabin sole. The hull was lifted off the iron ballast keel and all the keel bolts were renewed in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Deck</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The deck is epoxy-sheathed ply which replaced the original canvas covered deck. This is painted cream and is in excellent condition. There is an un-varnished 2.5 inch teak toe-rail, a teak rubbing strake, and a brass rubbing strip on this. Stainless steel stanchions and guard rails. Twin roller stem-head fitting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a fore-hatch with centre light opening onto the fore-deck. There is a 5 foot 6 inch long teakkylight over the central part of the saloon, and a cabin trunk in advance of the dog-house, each giving 6 foot standing room below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal accommodation is enchanting, in good original condition, in varnished mahogany and teak. All upholstery was replaced in 2011, new cushions, covered in blue textured vinyl. Sleeps 2 or 3 in comfort, 4 or 5 on occasional basis. The cockpit is exceptionally deep and comfortable, seating 4 or 5 with ease. Circular coaming around sides and rear. Bench seat across rear of cockpit, removable to allow one or two to sleep under totally enclosed cockpit cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doghouse roof extends aft over forward part of cockpit with sliding hatch, and wash-boards leading to cabin. There is a sheltered seat on either side in doghouse, to port over engine/electric control box, and to starboard over battery box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saloon. Three steps down from cockpit into galley area with 6-foot standing room under cabin trunk. Galley to starboard, and cupboard, wardrobe, and locker storage to port. Attractive keyhole bulkhead to main saloon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drop-leaf&nbsp; table with 2 drawers, against edge of starboard settee. Teak-framed skylight above, giving 6 foot standing headroom. Skylight gives excellent light to saloon, with small porthole on either side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Settee berth on each side of the main saloon, each measures full 6 feet; the port settee folds out to form a double berth. Settee backs fold inboard with storage on shelves behind, and storage above settee on each side. There are &lsquo;trotter box&rsquo; lockers with shelf and small shelves above, at each end of each settee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All settee cushions and backs re-upholstered with new Dunlopillow and washable blue textured vinyl in summer 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Space Heater.
