Spray may have been named after Joshua Slocum's\nboat which set off round the World in 1895</p>\n<p>Morecambe Bay Prawners (also known as Lancashire Nobbies) were fast sailed\npowered boats designed to cope with the shallow waters of the North West Coast.\nThere were large fleets at Morecambe, Fleetwood, Southport, Merseyside and\nAnnan. The development of the railways enable their catch to be brought to\ngrowing industrial areas of Lancashire.</p>\n<p>Spray was built for John Gardner of 1 Main Street Morecambe who owned her until\nat least 1898.

They have\nbeen in business since 1880.</p>\n<p>Sold on 15th December 1925 to Wilfred Woodhouse of 27 Cross Street, Morecambe,\nwho with his son got one hundred and twenty stone of big plaice out of the top\nend of the bay, a Morecambe record.</p>\n<p>Between 1958 and 1973 she was registered at Liverpool. She was owned by the\nEvans family of Heswall in the Wirral Peninsular who fished the Dee Estuary\nbefore returning to Maryport.</p>\n<p>She was then bought in 1987 by Tom Middlebrook, a Liverpool Insurance Broker and\nlater Secretary of the Nobby Owners Association and North West Secretary of the\nOGA. The Nobby Owners Association was set in 1897 by a group of enthusiast in\nLiverpool to encourage the restoration of Morecambe Bay Prawners (or Nobbies).\nThe Association organised regular Nobby races.</p>\n<p>Tom completely restored Spray over a period of three years. Tom cruised and\nraced Spray extensively keeping her at Liverpool. Under his ownership Spray was\na regular competitor in the Liverpool and Conway Nobby Races, winning many\ntrophies.
