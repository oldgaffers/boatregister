She was built by Crossfield's of Arnside in\n1896. Crossfield's were leading builders of Morecambe Bay Prawners, yachts and\nother boats including Arthur Ransome's Swallow from the 1840s to 1940s. Spray\nwas named after Joshua Slocum's boat which set off around the world in 1895.</p>\n<p>Morecambe Bay Prawners (also known as Lancashire Nobbies) were fast,\nsail-powered boats designed to cope with the shallow waters of the North West\nCoast. There were large fleets at Morecambe, Fleetwood, Southport, Merseyside\nand Annan. The development of the railways enable their catch to be brought to\ngrowing industrial areas of Lancashire. The boats had a central open cockpit\nwith the decks at waist height used as a working area.</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Morecambe 1896 - 1900</strong></p>\n<p>Spray was built in 1896 by William Crossfield in Arnside for John Gardner of 1\nMain Street Morecambe. The Gardners were a were a well established fishing\nfamily with several members owning boats. Her fishing boat number was LR 102.</p>\n<p>At the turn of the nineteenth century Morecambe was booming with holidaymakers\ncoming from the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire for the annual Wakes\nHolidays. New attractions included the Winter Gardens and the West End Pier. The\nresort had a fleet of around 100 prawners many of them built by Crossfields in\nArnside.</p>\n<p>Spray would have had an open cockpit when first built and for most of her\nworking life.</p>\n<p><strong>Solway Firth 1900 - 1920</strong></p>\n<p>On the 31st December 1900 she was sold to Edward Waters of Silloth on the Solway\nFirth and re-registered as CL4 a Carlisle fishing boat number. Between 1914 and\n1916 Spray was based at Annan on the other side of the Solway in Scotland and\nregistered as BA40 (Ballantrae). Ballantrae is a small harbour north of\nStranraer. Ballantrae was used as the fishing registration port for a wide area\nof Southern Scotland. In 1916 she returned to Silloth and was re-registered as\nCL 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Morecambe 1920 - 1936</strong></p>\n<p>In 1920 Spray returned to Morecambe. Between 1920 until 1925 she was used as a\nyacht by James Baxter, a fish merchant of Morecambe. Spray was raced in the\nMorecambe Regatta of 23rd September 1921. James Baxter and Sons are the longest\nestablished producers of Morecambe Bay Potted Shrimps. They have been in\nbusiness since 1880.</p>\n<p>Spray was sold on 15th December 1925 to Wilfred Woodhouse of 27 Cross Street,\nMorecambe. The Woodhouses were another Morecambe fishing family. Wilfred and his\nson set a Morecambe record by catching 120 stone of prime plaice at the top end\nof the Bay.</p>\n<p>It is not known when Spray first had an engine fitted, though engines started to\nbe used on Morecambe based boats from 1925 onwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Barrow 1938 - 1958</strong></p>\n<p>Spray was brought by Hugh Molineaux of Barrow and registered as BW3. Hugh\nrestored Spray and continued to use her for fishing,</p>\n<p>The first know photo of Spray was taken on the hard at Barrow in June 1944, when\nshe was owned by Bill Rawlinson. Alec Rawlinson is on the boat with him. Bill\ntook the engine out of Spray and sold her to Tom Hesketh who kept her on the\nbeach at Barrow. By 1950 she was already an old boat.</p>\n<p><strong>Dee Estuary 1958 - 1978</strong></p>\n<p>Spray was inherited by James, Archibald and Roy Hunter of Hoylake from their\nuncle in Barrow. Hoylake is a seaside town at the mouth of the Dee Estuary on\nthe Wirral peninsula. The town was originally a fishing village. To bring her\nback from Barrow she had to be dug out of the mud. Spray was registered at\nLiverpool with the number LL33. She was fitted with a petrol paraffin pocket\nvalve engine.</p>\n<p>She was sold on 5th August 1966 for \u00a3210 to Henry Evans, a fisherman of Mostyn\nAvenue, Heswall, and nephew to Dick Evans, owner of Heswall Boatyard. The\nBoatyard brought and sold boats, but focused mainly on storage and repair, only\noccasionally building new boats. On 23rd November 1966 the sale to a Prestatyn\nowner was cancelled due to breach of contract.</p>\n<p>Spray was eventually brought by Harold Hopper of Leasowe on the north coast of\nthe Wirral for \u00a3250 (about \u00a34600 in 2026 prices) on 4th March 1968, when she\nwould have 72 well past pension age. She was fitted with a 3 cylinder Lister\nengine, Her fishing registration was cancelled in October 1973, effectively\nbringing her 77 year fishing career to an end.</p>\n<p>She was brought by John Housley of Hoylake from an advertisement in Fishing\nNews. The Housleys were a well established fishing family. By the 1970s many\nfishermen found it difficult to make a living from fishing alone with changing\neating and shopping habits. Many took jobs in other industries, but continued to\nown a boat. If things changed the boat could always be re-registered for\nfishing. By this time Spray had a wheelhouse.</p>\n<p>Spray was brought in 1978 by Colin Gilmore. She was lying ashore at Hoylake\nGreen without engine, mast or running rigging. Colin removed Spray to Brunswick\nDock, which is home to Liverpool Marina and fitted her with a mast removed from\nMoonlight a Nobby that had been cut up. Colin brought Spray for private use\nrather than for fishing.</p>\n<p>From the late 70s there was an increased interest in Morecambe Bay Prawners or\nNobbies with enthusiasts buying old boats, such as Spray to keep the heritage\nalive. Several Nobbies were converted to yachts enabling them to make longer\njourneys. The first Liverpool Nobby Race was run in 1981 for the coveted Prawn\nTrophy with the Nobby Owners Association set up in 1987.</p>\n<p><strong>Maryport 1984 - 1987</strong></p>\n<p>In 1984 Spray was brought by Mr. Dickson of Maryport for \u00a32,000 (\u00a37000 in 2026\nprices), again for private use. She was delivered to Barrow, from where Mr\nDickson sailed Spray to Maryport</p>\n<p><strong>Liverpool 1987 - 2024 Tom Middlebrook</strong></p>\n<p>Spray was bought in 1987 by Tom Middlebrook, a Liverpool\u00a0 Insurance Broker and\nlater Secretary of the Nobby Owners Association and North West Secretary of the\nOGA.</p>\n<p>Tom completely restored Spray over a period of three years refitting her with\nher current layout. Tom cruised and raced Spray extensively keeping her at\nLiverpool Marina in Brunswick Dock. Under his ownership Spray was a regular\ncompetitor in the Liverpool and Conway Nobby Races, winning many trophies. Spray\nregularly appeared at the Peel Traditional Boat Festival on the Isle of Man. Tom\ncruised her to North Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Cumbrian\nCoast and the Isle of Man. Spray featured in the BBC 2017 Britain Afloat TV\nprogramme about Morecambe Bay Prawners.</p>\n<p>Tom's ownership of Spray in many ways parallels the redevelopment of the\nLiverpool Waterfront. In the early 80s Liverpool was at a low point with the\nToxeth Riots in 1981 and unemployment at 20%. Albert Dock was redeveloped from\nthe mid 1980s with the Maritime Museum opening in 1984. The area round Brunswick\nDock and Liverpool Marina was redeveloped as housing in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p><strong>Morecambe Bay Prawner Trust 2024 onwards</strong></p>\n<p>Spray was brought by the Morecambe Bay Prawner Trust in February 2024 for\n\u00a310,000 and moved to Glasson Marina south of Lancaster. She was relaunched at\nthe end of July 2025 after a programme work by volunteers aided by Matthew Foot\nof Bay Boatworks. Work included repairs to the hull in the bow area with several\nplanks being replaced, a new bowsprit and repainting.</p>\n<p>It is planned to keep her at Glasson in the winter taking her to Morecambe in\nthe summer mooring her close to the Stone Jetty and proposed Eden Centre as a\nreminder of Morecambe's fishing and maritime heritage.  </p>\n<p>If you are interested in joining the Trust, helping and maintain Spray\nsee<a href=\"https://morecambebayprawnertrust.org\">https://morecambebayprawnertrust.org</a></p>", "generic_type": ["Lancashire Nobby", "Morecambe Bay Prawner"], "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.743, "draft": 1.219, "length_on_deck": 9.754, "length_on_waterline": 8.534}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Glasson Dock Lancaster", "hull_form": "long keel sloping forefoot", "image_key": "Rf4gkr", "lastModified": "2025-09-20T14:51:12Z", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Spray", "oga_no": 1069, "ownerships": [{"end": 2021, "name": "John T Middlebrook", "share": 64, "start": 1989}, {"current": true, "name": "Morecambe Bay Prawner Charity", "share": 64, "start": 2024}], "place_built": "Arnside", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Owned by the Morecambe Bay Prawner Trust, a charity.
