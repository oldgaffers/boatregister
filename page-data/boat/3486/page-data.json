This resulted in a very solid 8.3\ntonne vessel. The rig was designd by Percy Dalton and the interior was designed\nand fitted out by the original owner.</p>\n<p>The boat was sold to Ron Arnold in 2009 who kept her in Weymouth and had plans\nto take her to the Mediterranean by way of the French canals. With his trip in\nmind, Ron had a new Collars mast and gaff made, updated to the interior and\nreplaced the running rigging. Sadly the trip to the Mediterranean never happened\nand Ron died in early 2020. Dayspring came into my ownership in September 2020\nand I plan to keep her in Plymouth and hope to attend various regattas in the\ncoming years.</p>", "generic_type": "Falmouth Quay Punt", "handicap_data": {"beam": 2.896, "draft": 1.615, "length_on_deck": 8.687, "length_on_waterline": 8.626, "propellor": {"blades": 3, "type": "fixed"}, "sailarea": 59.551, "thcf": 0.976}, "home_country": "GBR", "home_port": "Plymouth", "hull_form": "long keel deep forefoot", "id": "a5c5cfdd-5f2b-4998-b8ec-18750806cced", "image_key": "KSJP5d", "mainsail_type": "gaff", "name": "Dayspring", "oga_no": 3486, "ownerships": [{"end": 2020, "name": " Ron Arnold", "share": 64, "start": 2010}], "place_built": "Cornwall", "rig_type": "Cutter", "selling_status": "not_for_sale", "short_description": "<p>Cruising version of the Falmouth Working boat similar to the Heard 28 and the\nTamerisk 29</p>", "spar_material": "wood", "updated_at": "2022-03-26T15:57:14.407515+00:00", "year": 1980, "year_is_approximate": false}, "home": "/", "pathSlug": "/boat/3486"}}, "staticQueryHashes": []}
